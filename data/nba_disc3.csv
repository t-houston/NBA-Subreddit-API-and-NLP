Truthfully, I dislike nationally televised games for middle-market team. A view on a team can be skewed completely simply by one broadcast. A story has to be told with them, we aren’t simply watching two teams battle it out. Instead, there’s an underlying storyline reason for why they’re appearing on TNT or ESPN. 

The storyline for last week’s Houston Rockets versus the Oklahoma City Thunder was the return of Russell Westbrook. It later turned into a storyline of how Chris Paul was re-inventing the Oklahoma City Thunder into a fun team.

They are not a fun team. 

We haven’t heard much about the Thunder for most of this season. A quiet 22-17 record currently has them in the 7th seed of the Western conference which has been formidable, especially for a team expected to be at the bottom of the standings. 4 games above the Memphis Grizzlies, as the trade deadline gets closer and closer, the question of what they should do becomes a little more apparent. But first, we should talk about how they even got this point.

Most will credit the success of this team to Chris Paul. His reminder to the world of how good he truly is has been a feel good story. Completing his best veteran Jason Kidd impression, he’s impact on the court isn’t in the stats: its been his style of play and vocal leadership—or as people will commonly call it, ‘The Chris Paul Effect.’

With Chris Paul on the floor, OKC has a net +4.9 offensive rebound percentage, + 4.9 defensive rebound percentage, - 2.4 turnover percentage leading to a +5.0 offensive rating. His presence on defense has probably been the most impressive thing about his time in Oklahoma City. Because of the realization that their best line-up includes the three primarily ball-handers being on the court at the same time—Paul, Schröder and SGA—the modern 2-3 zone has brought out the best qualities of CP3.

With this line-up, Chris won’t be up defending at the top of zone. Instead, he’ll usually be working around the corner. Despite being known for his on-ball defense, his off-ball work and calls have been the crucial. Being able to jump in front of a pass, get a rebound to start the transition or even working a defender in the corner is what you would want from a zone-wing defender.

On the offensive end, it hasn’t been the Chris Paul show. But his impact on the game, is what we care about. 

Chris Paul has turned the Thunder into a half court team. They’re the third slowest team in the association, rank 8th in time of possessions and ranked towards the bottom of the league in pace. This is because of the concept of ‘match-up control.’ Because of their lack of wing-depth, throwing out an additional ball-hander forces a defensive nightmare—where a guard could get a match-up against a forward in isolation or a forward could work his way around the court into a favorable match-up. 

There are two things about this Thunder offense that can easily be seen to the average fan: they like the high screen and they like guard penetration. OKC averages the third most drives per game—53.7. What’s kind of surprising is how all three of the primary ball-handers approach the drive.

Shai likes to score. So every time he gets an opportunity to do so, he’ll go into isolation on the wing. He’s the interesting person to watch when leading the offense because of how quick he likes to operate. 

\[Against the 76ers, he brings the ball up the court and immediately creates the two-man opportunity. The team follows his lead, stacking the opposite side and Steven Adams prepares to set-up the high screen\](https://youtu.be/0hlnAboaKN8?t=31). Adams correctly lays off actually setting the screen—as SGA’s first step gets by Simmons—and allows for the 1-on-1 match-up to the basket with Embiid having to respect the possible cut from Adams. With no cut, SGA is able to get the clean left-hand finish with 15-seconds on the shot-clock.

When he isn’t leading the ball up the floor, he’s a lot more patient on his drive. \[Showing the influence of Chris Paul, he takes the screen from Nerlens Noel and shifts to the foul-line, with Thon Maker protecting the rim\](https://youtu.be/h3RSmspIi4o?t=182). The floor is incredibly spaced well, allowing for a two-on-two battle at the basket with no Wolves defender able to collapse on the driving SGA. Because of a poor steal attempt from Maker, SGA is able to breeze around the defender for the right hand finish.

Chris Paul still wants to get to the middle of the floor. He won’t try to finish at the basket, instead, he’ll get to the foul line and stop—looking for either the cutting high screen or take the easy mid-range jumper. The reason being is this team isn’t necessarily focused on motion. Their style of play loves breaking the modern zone and punishing on the outside. \[Paul gets the ball with less than 10-seconds on the shot-clock and the Grizzlies have to respect the drive\](https://youtu.be/qFI1NA-Zm9M?t=201). But as he gets to stripe, he realizes they have overcommitted. Ferguson and Shai stay at home around the perimeter and Ferguson is rewarded.

CP3 has the set the tone for mid-range game displayed by the Thunder. They’re shooting incredibly well, 47.2% on 13.7 attempts from the mid-range—which is the best in the league. Because of the limited scoring potential from Noel and Adams, the biggest advantage is that mid-range jumper becomes open on two-man possessions. If, for example, Paul is able to penetrate thanks to a high screen from Adams, \[the secondary defender will often times defend the roll and paint, rather than stepping up to stop ball\](https://youtu.be/MW31IcQDN2c?t=103). 

Shai and Chris have been good but the two keys have honestly been Dennis and Danilo—two players that simply have hit another level this season. Both players can thank the foundation Shai and Chris have set.

Dennis has become the wildcard ball-handler. His improvement as a scorer has been key factor number one—shooting 5.5% better from the field, 47.9% from the mid-range on 144 attempt—which has been a set-up from his 42.7% on 232 last season. The phrase people might use to describe him is that he’s become a lot more efficient, which is leading to a lot more trust in his capabilities. This year, he’s accounting for 27.6% of his team’s assists, 26.2% of his team’s points and 28.9% of the team’s made three-point attempts when on the floor.

He’s been an incredible compliment to the other two guards. Danilo Gallinari has been an incredible compliment to the whole team. While primarily being a catch-and-shoot specialist—accounting for 46.7 of his attempts versus 34.7% while on the Clippers—his 60.3% eFG rate has been a critical compliment to the driving guards of the Thunder. Guards having him as an outlet around the perimeter has forced defenders to stay at home.

With all of this being said, the players’ individual performance has only accounted for the partial story. All of this background was a primer to the three things that are explaining the tale of the Oklahoma City Thunder. Because truthfully, there are still a lot of questions and concerns going on.

Thing #1: The team hasn’t been punished for going small. 

The Oklahoma City Thunder are defending the three incredibly well—opponents are averaging 31.3 FG attempts from three, hitting 34.7% of their shots from deep. Instead, teams are looking to get their points from the paint—attempting to punish times where Paul will be guarding out in the corner. And teams are often able to. 

To beat the zone, it needs to be stretched. The Indiana Pacers, the Los Angeles Lakers did this to perfection and put up the biggest point differential the Thunder have faced this season. If you force the three-guard line-up to not work, it inhibits a huge portion of the Thunder offensive flow. Because of the limitations in scoring from the 5 role—often resorting from high post to low post as their offense, any disruption of rhythm is huge.

Thing #2: Teams are guarding the Thunder wrong

\*Did you know the lowest scoring game put up by the Oklahoma City Thunder was against the Washington Wizards in the second game of the season?\* The Wizards pushing the boundaries of the defensive—making the Thunder working from above the foul-line. With an exceptional perimeter defense performance—being able to stop the ball forced wasted possessions. The pack-line defense frustrated the offense of OKC. 

In reality, we don’t see a lot of variance in win-loss offensive performances. Surprisingly, the Thunder have a higher points scored per game in their losses versus when they win. However, it is incredibly frustrating to what teams get baffled by small ball yet again. The fundamentals of defense suddenly get thrown out the window. 

The modern zone does not work against an isolation offense. The Clippers have found out the hard way and they’re just stubborn or don’t care enough to change it. A true zone or an aggressive zone can force poor choices from the point guards. The problem is that right now, the lack of aggression on the defensive end in the modern NBA appears to be the bigger problem. It what makes scrappy teams like the broken Golden State Warriors so annoying to play against.

Thing #3: The Expanded Win-Loss Record of the Oklahoma City Thunder

They’ve kind of lucked out. They’re 6-11 against above .500 teams, 16-6 against below .500 teams. They’ve seen Golden State 3 times (3-0), Cleveland, Chicago, Charlotte, Brooklyn and the New Orleans for a total of 7 games, all of which they’ve won. Their incredible December included wins against the Pelicans, Minnesota, Portland, Utah, Chicago Memphis, Phoenix, the Clippers, Toronto, Dallas and Charlotte. They’ve had it pretty easy—and to their credit, they’ve taken advantage of it. 

But at times, their ‘clutch factor’ is kind of worrying. Everyone talks about how their incredible in clutch time. They have the lowest average scoring margin for an above .500 team (+1.5), they’re 5-5 and in games that end up with a margin of victory being less than or equal to 3—which is 16th best in the league. 

In fact, their clutch statistics aren’t really impressive. The two key stats have been personal fouls drawn (2.7) and opponent turnovers (1.5). 

There is always a team that benefits from the chaos and it appears this year’s team is the Oklahoma City Thunder. Poor starts to the season from believed contenders like Portland, Minnesota, and the Spurs, the Warriors and Pelicans being plagued by injuries, turned a possible disaster year for the Thunder into a quick rebuild. The problem is that chaos may think you’re in a better spot that you truly are. 

With the amount of assets at the disposal, media outlets are murmuring over the thought that the Thunder could make a move to be buyers this season. But with their biggest whole being in the wing position, how unconventional their best line-up is, it doesn’t feel like their one piece away from contending for a title. Truthfully, \[it feels like they’re stuck in the middle of the west\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMAIsqvTh7g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMAIsqvTh7g)). Elite teams to the left of them, jokers to the right.

Sam Presti isn’t the type of individual to go all-in during the middle of the season and truthfully, he shouldn’t feel pressured to do so. He’s set the team up for the future. \[Success takes time. They’re in the middle of this chaotic ride but everything, everything will be just fine. Everything will be all right\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKsxPW6i3pM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKsxPW6i3pM)).",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,75485,public,self,[OC] Stuck in the Middle of the West: Questioning the Rapid Resurgence of the Oklahoma City Thunder,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/enzjdt/oc_stuck_in_the_middle_of_the_west_questioning/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chris Paul did not fly back to Oklahoma City with his teammates Tuesday night after he practically defeated the Brooklyn Nets all by himself. Instead, he stayed in town for a meeting with NBA Players Association officials to discuss proposed changes to the playoff landscape.

If approved, the 82-game schedule could be a thing of the past.

And you know that time-tested thing where NBA teams play 82 games to determine who goes to the playoffs? That could be a thing of the past, too, if what NBA commissioner Adam Silver is proposing is accepted by the players.

In an exclusive interview, Paul — the president of the players’ union — was very much the diplomat.

“That’s the thing about our league: We’re at least brainstorming and trying to find a way to make it entertaining.

“But at the end of the day, it’s still entertainment,” Paul said.

For an old-school faction of the NBA’s audience, changing something that isn’t broken makes little practical sense.

Under Silver’s proposal, there would be two major adjustments: A play-in tournament for the seventh and eighth seeds, and an in-season tournament that would be held in November or December and would keep some players and teams from playing an 82-game schedule.

Most NBA records are based upon an 82-game schedule, and there are some who feel the record book would be compromised by changing that number to 78 or 79.

“But they haven’t always played 82 games, either, and everything is a conversation. Nothing has been finalized,” Paul said. “Luckily there are a lot of people who have been in the business, and hopefully the right decisions are made.”

ESPN Reported earlier in the day that the NBA is seriously reconsidering the idea of reseeding the four conference finalists. A proposal that was floated called for reseeding, which could have brought an end to the top team in the East playing the top team from the West.

The NBA’s coastal teams have been largely against this reseeding idea, the report said, and research has shown that the proposal of reseeding teams based on regular season records could lead to travel increases of 60% and could result in one in one out of every four series being played across three time zones.

The NBA’s Board of Governors is expected to vote on the changes in April, but the players’ okay is needed in order to make such significant changes to the $8 billion per year business.

Paul takes the temperature of different players every time he travels with the Oklahoma City Thunder, and Wednesday’s meeting at union headquarters in Manhattan should bring some clarity to the union’s position.

For now, Paul is non-committal as to where he and the union stand.

“Nothing is set in stone, and we’ll figure it out,” Paul said. “Personally, this isn’t my company. We’re a league and a union, and we’re going to figure it out.”",False,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,75483,public,self,Chris Paul Stays In New York To Discuss NBA Changes With Union,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/enzab2/chris_paul_stays_in_new_york_to_discuss_nba/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was a lot of interesting replies from that thread like 

&gt; Murray is exactly the kind of player that advanced stats underrate--somewhat inefficient but talented creative scorer who puts a lot of pressure on the defense. Even if he's missing a lot he's really dynamic with the ball and that's hard to measure statistically.

and

&gt; Murray is 22. Rozier is 25. Murray has the potential to improve dramatically. Rozier probably will not get any better. Athletically, Murray is head and shoulders above Rozier. He is far quicker and stronger. Murray has the potential to be a dominating two-way player while rozier is just another awkward combo-guard. Rozier is practically guaranteed to be overpaid the life of this contract. Murray could improve to being a value. 

and

&gt; Just my .02 - I don't think someone who is on pace for a VORP of 2 and had never gotten a 2 over full season warrants max money, no matter perceived potential. Yes, there are GMs who are going to do stupid things and pay stupid money for it but if a player isn't working towards very good status and puts up hollow-ish numbers or has significant flaws in his game, he does not warrant a max contract.

and

&gt; I think taking Terry gives you a lot more cap flexibility for a slight difference in stats. 

So would anyone's reasoning change for Wiggins vs Barnes? Are stats somehow more meaningful for Wiggins than they are for Murray? I think there's enough difference in the reputations of all relevant players and the size of all relevant contracts for the discussion to take a different direction than the previous thread.

Background: At the beginning of his fourth season, Wiggins signed an extension worth $148m/5 years. In the 2019 offseason, Harrison Barnes signed an extension worth $85m/4 years. The total difference between Murray's and Rozier's contract is $113m. The total difference between Wiggins' and Barnes' contract is $62m.

As for stats, Barnes has a higher TS% and is the more efficient scorer. Wiggins has the higher ppg, bpg and PER.

First off, I think it's better to accept this season is a wash and keep Kyrie healthy for next season so both KD and Kyrie are healthy coming into the 2020 season. No point in risking a longterm injury to Kyrie when they're not competing. 

My second point is that the Nets don't have a lot of options to improve the roster financially from here on out. They won't be able to sign any free agents outside of whatever exception they might have and minimum contracts, so the draft is really their best option. Right now they have Philadelphias 1st round pick (.#21) and Denvers 2nd round pick (.#55). Recently Brooklyn has shown that they can draft well with no high round picks - in 2016 they drafted Caris Levert with the 20th pick in the draft, in 2017 they drafted Jarret Allen with the 22nd pick in the draft and in 2018 they drafted Džanan Musa with the 29th pick and Kurucs with the 40th pick in the draft. Pretty good track record in the past 3 years with drafting outside of the Lottery. 

Going back to 2015, the 10th - 14th picks have yielded some very solid cost controlled players. 

**2015:** Justice Winslow 10th overall, Myles Turner 11th overall, and Devin Booker 14th overall

**2016:** Domantas Sabonis 11th overall and Taurean Prince 12th overall

**2017:** Zach Collins 10th overall, Luke Kennard 12th overall, Donovan Mitchell 13th overall and Bam Adebayo 14th overall

**2018:** Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11th overall and Michael Porter Jr. 14th overall

**2019:** Tyler Herro 14th overall

Those were all late lottery selections who were solid young players and were very cheap and cost controlled for 4 years. I trust Brooklyn to find a good player with a pick in that range. 

Before you say ""Well they already have Phillys 1st round selection, why do they need to miss the playoffs when they can just draft someone with that late pick?"", my logic is the more chances at hitting on a draft pick the better - 3&gt;2. Most of the team already has playoff experience and I think it would be more valuable for Brooklyn to have a late lottery pick than to get swept by the Bucks or lose handily to one of the other tops eastern conference teams.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,75448,public,self,CMV: The Nets would be better off shutting down Kyrie for the season and trying to land their lottery protected 1st round pick,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/enuj0x/cmv_the_nets_would_be_better_off_shutting_down/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am not an Anthony Davis hater. I'm actually a fan of his. But, the reason I ask this question is because of Anthony Davis' RPM numbers.

For those who don't know, RPM is ""real plus minus"". RPM provides a player's estimated on-court impact on team performance, measured in net point differential per 100 offensive and defensive possessions, while taking into account teammates, opponents and additional factors (like pace of play).

While a lot of people are talking about AD as being a DPOY contender, or, even, front runner, his DRPM (defensive real plus minus) stats are shockingly mediocre.

AD's DRPM is currently [at 0.67, which ranks him as the 30th best power forward in the NBA, by that measure](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/sort/DRPM/position/6). Taking into account all positions, AD ranks as the 139th best defensive player, by DRPM, in the NBA. For perspective, an average defender would rate a 0, bad defenders would be in the negatives, while above average defenders would rank in positive numbers, so RPM still says that AD is a good defender...just not a great one. When you look at other guys who are typically considered as top flight defenders, their DRPM ranks are pretty in-line with how people see them. Kawhi Leonard ranks 2nd overall. Rudy Robert ranks 8th overall (#1 among centers). Guys like Paul Milsap, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid, Marc Gasol and Pat Bev all litter the top 20 ranks for DRPM.

Now, you might be thinking to yourself: but, the Lakers are the 4th ranked defensive in the league. Clearly, that is an indication that AD has had a massive impact. But, the thing with that is that DRPM doesn't give AD credit for the Lakers' defensive turnaround. The league's number one player for defensive RPM this year is none other than LeBron James, with a massive 5.13. Since on-off stats are a key aspect of DRPM numbers, this would indicate that the Lakers are a much better defensive team when AD is off the floor than they are when LeBron is off the floor. Other Laker bigs rank pretty close to AD, with Javale McGee ranking just better than him (0.93 DRPM), and Dwight Howard ranking just behind him (0.59 DRPM), indicating that, in the context of the Lakers, the team isn't seeing a big drop off in defensive efficiency with AD's backups in the game.

Another interesting aspect of this is that AD hasn't always had poor DRPM stats. In 2017-2018 (his last full season engaged as a member of the Pelicans), he ranked 6th in the league in DRPM. In 2016-2017, he also ranked 6th in DRPM. Clearly, those numbers show that AD is an excellent defender...except that if you accept DRPM when they say AD is an elite defender, it is tough to ignore them when they say that his defensive impact has massively dipped this year.

So, I ask the question: is there something that the DRPM stats are missing here? Is this just a case of an excellent shot blocker being overrated because of his highlight reel?

Do you gamble on Murray's potential or get Rozier who can give you his current production for the third of the cost?

Rozier has a significantly higher 3P% and is the more efficient scorer. Murray has the edge on FT%. It's pretty much even everywhere else. 

**Basic stats:**

|2|Terry Rozier|25|.427|.394|.843|4.3|4.4|1.2|0.2|2.5|18.4|.551|

**Advanced stats:**

|2|Terry Rozier|25|15.4|.551|24.5|1.8|.063|1.4|-1.9|-0.5|0.5|

Terry has the better TS%. Murray has the better BPM. They're comparable everywhere else.

I didn't include the TRB%/AST%/STL%/BLK% for readability reasons but they are all within 1% of each other or less. Murray's TOV% is 2% less than Rozier's.

This is most on display for a player who can handle the ball and create his own shot, be it at the rim or from the mid-range/3-point line (e.g., Harden, KD, Luka, etc.)

Now, I see less of an emphasis on the assist. Who will be the next Jason Williams or Steve Nash: amazing court vision and control, allowing them to get their teammates good looks at the rim or from the 3 with slick moves and clever no-looks?

Over the years, individual players have singular highlight-reel assists. They’re amazing and incredible, breathtaking. I love a good one-on-one battle with the offensive player taking it to the hoop and slamming it home, but there is a subtle finesse associated with a well calculated assist.

I’ve watched Williams’ passing highlights so many times, and find myself thinking, “Will there ever be another like him?” Today’s NBA doesn’t promote the assist, so why would a player work specifically on that skill? It’s become so focused on the individual’s ability that the finesse between a passer and his recipient is not as present.

Due to Kobe's incredibly diverse offensive arsenal he was able to overcome various looks on defense and Taylor shows that Kobe's box +/- actually improved in the playoffs versus the regular season in 2008, in contrast to Harden who's numbers depreciated in the playoffs versus the regular season.

Without going into too much detail on that video, it got me thinking about one of my favorite players to watch this year: Luka. Whatever expectations he had going intuitive year 2 after his ROY campaign, it's clear he's surpassed them and positioned himself as a strong case for being considered a top 5 player in the league already.  I love watching Luka play and seeing what could maybe be one of the greatest players of all time in his early years is exciting.

However I do wonder if Lukas otherworldly sophomore campaign is helped by the fact that Rick Carlisle lets him be the entire offense when he's on the floor. What Luka does in his role is incredibly difficult and impressive - I'm willing to garner only a few players in his role can do what he does give or take - Giannis, Lebron, Harden etc so this isn't meant to take away from what he's doing. But I wonder if this current setup the Mavs have of Luka being the one man offense is the best way to cater to his skill set - and if it puts a ceiling on him.

Does Luka need to be the heliocentric universe of whatever offense he's on to be as good as he is? Would his game scale better or worse than other top players right now in various other offensive situations?  Part of me wonders if having the entire offense run through Luka puts a floor on how good they can be, especially when defense gets more physical and clamps are brought out in the playoffs. It feels like if Luka can't get his step back going or get his defender behind him on the pick and roll he gets forced to dump the ball out.  When everything is working, his step back is falling and his high pick and roll is working everything clicks into place. His shooting forces the defender to play up on him which opens his drive which opens his floater/tough layup/lob/skip pass game but when one of these factors isn't working it feels like it negatively impacts Luka harder than another player.

I’m a Warriors fan but I feel like it could be good for both teams.

The DLo / RoCo thing has been discussed to death and we all know the pros and cons (DLo is better and young but RoCo’s a better fit for GSW), but to me the pick / RoCo are more straightforwardly comparable in value.

GSW does it because RoCo is a good fit for them and would be more useful during this championship window. He’s also a safety net for GSW as they adopt a wait and see approach to DLo, and he’ll always be eminently tradeable. 

MIN does it because it might be the best offer that works for their timeline. Contenders, who are the ones thirsting over RoCo, typically don’t want to trade any of their best players or most promising young players, and since they’re contending their picks probably won’t be as good as GSW’s. If I’m MIN, even if this draft isn’t rumored to be the best, a swing at a pick near the top of the draft could be worth it for RoCo.

I know people often talk about a 4 point shot, or 10 minute quarters, but those feel like bandaids to an inherent problem in the modern NBA. It just works out that, due to the high volume of chances to score in the NBA, there are larger chances for teams to come back from early deficits. This is only made more prevalent in the modern NBA which facilitates exciting scoring runs. So, I came up with something that I think would be amazingly exciting, easily broadcast-able, easily consumable via league pass or twitter, and vastly increases the enjoyment of watching a game start to finish. 

What if we removed quarters, and played a basketball like you play a tennis match.  Five sets 10 minutes long a piece.  Five minute TV Time Out between sets, 1 Team Timeout per set. First to win 3 sets wins the match.  This has a good number of positive attributes.   


* There are climaxes through out a game. Multiple chances for last second heroics to win a set, which in the long run increases the excitement through out the match. Instead of tuning in for the last 5 minutes of a game, out of a two hour broadcast, you would probably want to catch the last 2 minutes of every set. 
* Every set matters, so there is an importance put on every part of the game instead of just the fourth quarter
* You create strong advertising breaks that can be extended/shortened to fit national vs local broadcasts. 
* You minimize the number of TV timeouts during real game play, minimizing the effect it has on the flow of the game. 
* This helps to minimize the length of bad games, as good teams will blow out bad teams in 3 sets, saving them a possible extra 20 minutes a game. 

Of course, there are negatives here:

* Makes for variable broadcast time
* Minimizes the in arena experience for bad teams as a match could run for as little as 40 minutes
* Minimizes the importance of role players/bench players in the regular season

In this graph, new odds are markedly **flatter** and more even. ""Flattened""... that's the term that was bandied about when the new odds debuted.

[Well, here's the real graph.](https://i.imgur.com/pwYYEB5.png). Those two lines are so close they could be lovers!

Okay, they're not identical, and finishing with the very worst record these days is significantly less valuable, but the difference shrinks rapidly, and the two models are nearly equal by the time you're looking at finishing around 5th in the tank standings.

Where did this misinformed take come from? Well, the first cause is just that people hear ""the NBA addressed tanking"" and assume the problem is fixed. The NBA loves this strategy. They've made  changes that would obviously be ineffectual several other times as a means of getting people to shut up about a topic that doesn't flatter the league... flopping fines or [fines for resting players](https://www.si.com/nba/point-forward/2012/11/30/gregg-popovich-david-stern-spurs-fined-nba). These token changes or inconsistent fines are meant to change the conversation rather than change player or team behavior.

But that's not the only cause. The main deceptive quality to the lotto changes is that so much discussion centers around the reduced number of ping pong balls for the teams with the worst records, ignoring the fact that ping pong balls only determine 4 picks. **After the top 4 picks, you draft in order of record**.

What does this mean? Well bottom 3 teams each still have a ~48% chance of not having their ping pong ball selected for ANY of the top 4 picks and thus having their pick determined by their record... Say you finish with the 3rd worst record in the league. There's a 48% chance your ping pong balls never surface and a 73% chance that at least one of the teams above you in the standings also is not selected via lotto, meaning you have a 35% of dropping to 6th or 7th. A team with the worst record cannot drop below 5th. 

So will teams still tank? Sure seems that way. Let's look at the records of the worst 3 teams the last 4 years, including projected records for this season. 

2019 / 20 (projected):  17-65, 19-64, 22-60   
2018 / 19 (1st year w/ new lotto odds): 17-65, 19-63, 19-63  
2017 / 18: 21-61, 22-60, 24-58  
2016 / 17: 20-62, 24-58, 26-56

Hard to say the change is having any real effect. Maybe it's done some stemming of the tide of teams embracing a clearly effective strategy, but it definitely hasn't stopped tanking.

One last thought: I respect people who are bothered by tanking. I think it sucks too, but it is important to the league that small market teams have a chance, and the combo of tanking + bird rights + restricted free agency + max contracts is the only way the NBA has figured out to prevent winning in the NBA from becoming strictly a product of how desirable your market is. IMO, it's goofy to say something like ""teams shouldn't tank"". Instead, look at the league. Say to the league, ""you need to make real changes so that tanking is no longer the right choice for any team.""

None of these trades are really ""predictions"" and the value of return is going to depend on your own view of each player's career trajectory. Instead, these are just examples of the kinds of trades that would be necessary to make a major trade possible, and the types of suitor teams that might make the move. If you have other trade ideas around these players, please share them with the class!

**Kevin Love**

1. Portland – Kevin Love and 2021 2nd for Hassan Whiteside (expiring) and 2020 POR 1st [top-4 protected]

2. Houston – Kevin Love for Clint Capela, Nene and 2020 HOU 1st

Kevin Love is a sought-after talent on a contract that teams want to avoid. You just shouldn’t spend $25m/year on a 2nd option with an annual injury history. But for teams that already have less-than-ideal cap situations, Love still presents a value that will be pursued by a few teams in the league. I just don't think those teams will have to give up much to get him.

Portland has coveted Love for years, but the timing has never been right. I could see them making the leap and going after Kevin Love, but if they’re trying to be frugal, they could just as easily never give Cleveland a call. I don’t think anybody believes Whiteside is more than a 1-year rental for Portland and they’ve been trying to make a move for years now, so the timing might be right here.

Houston needs another offensive option to take pressure off of a struggling Russell Westbrook and a slumping Eric Gordon. Clint Capela is still young and is far from a negative asset, while Nene is just thrown-in to make the money right. Houston has to give up Capela rather than Gordon because they just don’t have enough draft capital to entice Cleveland to take Gordon’s years off the books.

**Andre Drummond**

1. Portland – Andre Drummond for Hassan Whiteside (expiring) and 2020 POR 1st [top-4 protected]

2. Atlanta – Andre Drummond and Reggie Jackson (expiring) for Chandler Parsons (expiring), Evan Turner (expiring) and 2020 BKN 1st [lottery protected]

3. Sacramento – Andre Drummond and Derrick Rose for Dewayne Dedmon, Trevor Ariza (partially expiring), Bogdan Bogdanovic (RFA) and 2020 SAC 1st [top-4 protected]

Andre Drummond doesn’t want to leave. I do believe him when he says it. But Detroit should know that Drummond doesn’t match their timeline if they truly plan to rebuild. The problem is, Drummond will demand a lot of money when he’s a free agent, and most contenders aren’t going to pay him. 

Which teams does that leave as candidates? Smaller market teams looking to make a splash. Portland wants to contend every year that Lillard is around, and Drummond is a clear upgrade over Whiteside. Atlanta has been the team everyone’s discussed, and while I don’t love the fit, the money makes sense.

Sacramento has big contracts they want to get rid of, and if Detroit is truly tanking then they won’t mind taking them. Bogdanovic is expendable for the returns Sacramento would receive and Detroit probably would want to pay him after this season.

**Jrue Holiday**

1. Miami – Jrue Holiday and E’Twaun Moore (expiring) for Goran Dragic (expiring), Meyers Leonard (expiring), Tyler Herro and MIA 2020 1st [top-4 protected] 

2. San Antonio – Jrue Holiday and E’Twaun Moore (expiring) for DeMar DeRozan, Lonnie Walker and 2020 SAS 1st [lottery protected]

3. Clippers – Jrue Holiday for Patrick Beverley, Mo Harkless (expiring), Landry Shamet and 2020 LAC 1st

Jrue Holiday is going to be traded, and whoever gets him is going to be very glad they spent the money. Miami is the most logical destination; they are a piece away from contending, they won’t have much wiggle room in free agency anyway, and they have a 1st they can part with.

If San Antonio has been bluffing about wanting to keep DeRozan, then New Orleans should be calling them up and trying to see what they can get. Jrue Holiday might not make the most sense for a San Antonio roster full of point guards, but he has shown willingness to play off-ball and he’s way better than anyone they’ve got.

The Clippers aren’t going to do this, but wouldn’t it be fun if they did? A core of Jrue, Kawhi, PG, Lou and Harrell would just be nasty.

**Thunder players (Steven Adams, Gallinari, Schroder**

1. Sacramento – Steven Adams and 2020 DEN 1st for Dewayne Dedmon, Trevor Ariza (partially expiring) and a 2020 2nd

2. Miami - Danilo Gallinari (expiring) and Dennis Schroder for Goran Dragic (expiring), James Johnson and 2020 MIA 1st

I don’t really see these OKC trades as “likely”, I just think they’re fun to think about.

If Sacramento wants to get better down low, signing Dedmon in the offseason has not been the solution. I still see value in Dedmon but the guy is already asking out of Sactown. Oklahoma City has decided to compete this year, but they also want to get their finances back in order. This would be a cheap salary dump that would save OKC $11m against the cap in 2021.

I'm not sure if anybody, this trade looks great for both parties. However, GSW are in the tax and T-Wolves are over the cap, working out who'd be the 3rd team interested is a hassle. Minnesota would have to give up Teague's contract and someone else, I suspect it's doable though as I've heard some talk about this trade. Or... give up Wiggins. The fit with D'Lo is questionable either way.

**Warriors**

There was a thread like 2 weeks ago about playing Klay at 3 and I can see a Steph-D'Lo-Klay-Green-X lineup working perfectly fine, but I think that Ro-Co is the perfect guy for GSW. Discount deal, one of the best 3&amp;D wings in the league, seamless fit, and have some doubts about D'Angelo's fit in the backcourt with Curry. 

Curry-Thompson-RoCo-Green-X on the other hand seems very solid overall and you can have Klay defend the best guard and frontcourt defense is stellar, so you can have elite defense once again even with average Steph. Also you have a possibility to run a small-ball typical GSW lineup with Curry-Klay-RoCo-Green and say Paschall or somebody else at 3, or a guard and slide Klay to 3.

Covington's great contract allows for more leeway and creativity in roster shape as well. I think it's a jackpot for the Warriors, what better they can get for Russell? 

**Timberwolves**

The T-Wolves aquire KAT's good buddy on a long deal and they can build an offensive powerhouse team around them, aquire some free defensive-minded players in the free agency when Dieng's contract expires. I think they would have a great timeline as a franchise and compete with Mavs/Celtics/Nuggets/Jazz after the Clippers/Lakers/Warriors/Nets get old and decline. And they'd matchup fairly well against these teams in their current shape. 

They have 2 long-term star/borderline superstar players that still will improve and build the team around them. I suppose you have your 'big 3' with Wiggins who has been good this year I guess, or at least improved quite a lot in terms of production and efficiency. Or move him on if anybody wanted him, that way the contracts work out way easier. Don't really watch enough Wovles to make a comment so appreciate your input but I think Wiggins' fit alongside Russell is not the greatest to say the least.

Arright’ bear with me this is a ridiculous trade idea, but I think this can work.

**Houston Rockets** receives:

* Karl-Anthony Towns ($27.3M 5 Years)
* Nicolas Batum ($25.6M 2 Years)

**Minnesota Timberwolves** receives:

* Jrue Holiday ($26.2M 3 Years)
* Terry Rozier ($19.9M 3 Years)
* Clint Capela ($14.9M 4 Years)

* Derrick Favors ($17.7M 1 Year)

**New Orleans Pelicans** receives: 

* Andrew Wiggins ($27.5M 4 Years)
* Cody Zeller ($14.5M 2 Years)

The Hornets are the lynchpin of this trade. They’ll get rid of Batum ($25.6M 2 Years), Rozier ($19.9M 3 Years) and Zeller’s (2 years 14.5M) contract. They take on Derrick Favors contract which expires after this year. As for Russ, well, we’ll get back to him in a bit..

The Rockets lose Russ and Clint; the 2017 65-win Rockets is the best version of this team and that had CP3 in it. It’s time to move on and revamp the core of the team. The cost for KAT is taking on Batum’s contract.

The T-Wolves need to part ways with KAT and Wiggins. Those two as the core may never be a playoff team or at least in the next two years. Getting Jrue and Clint at \~40M for the next 3 years is a steal. The only question is whether Scary Terry’s contract is worth it. 

The Pelicans get Wiggins who at 24 years old seems more age appropriate for the Pelicans. Imagine a line up of Lonzo, Wiggins, Zion, BI and a random center (that could’ve been Julius Randle!). Cody Zeller is the cost for getting Wiggins. 

So why do the Hornets take on Russ’s contract? Zeller, Rozier and Batum will make over \~$120M Million over the next two years- $140M if you include Rozier’s third year. Russ will make about \~80M in the next two years. If the Hornets are able to buy him out fr))om anywhere between $80M - $120M and find a team that will pay him the remainder of his contract this deal could work.

Now who’s a team in the East that is performing really well, like second best in the East well and somehow has managed to win 6 games in OT- the Heat. Now imagine if the Heat took on the remainder of Westbrook’s contract and are able to pull off the trade for Kevin Love proposed by the u/DevinBookerGOAT ([**Link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/eagii4/possible_kevin_love_trade_to_miami/)):

**Miami** gives

* Dion Waiters (12.1)
* Meyers Leonard (11.2 expiring)
* James Johnson (15.3m)

**Cleveland** gives

* Kevin Love (28.9m)
* John Henson (9.7m expiring)

The Heat would reunite Westbrook with his UCLA buddy Kevin Love and convince them to rework their deals to form a trio with Jimmy Butler.

They're paying Iggy 17M to not play, and should take the best deal available at the trade deadline. That still leaves a lot of questions around their roster.

I see Ja Morant and Jaren Jackson Jr as untouchable. Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks, and Jonas Valinchunas are unlikely to be moved unless an offer well above their value comes their way. Tyus Jones, De'Anthony Melton are similar, albeit more available. Crowder and Hill have been the team's veteran presence on the court, instrumental in the team's success, they are also expiring. Anderson has been stuck behind both of them in the rotation.  

That leaves a few guys at the end of the rotation, waiting for injuries to get minutes: 
Grayson Allen, Bruno Caboclo, Marko Guduric, and Josh Jackson. Of these, only Grayson would have much value. 

Grizzlies positions of need: 

Shooting Guard: Dillon Brooks is the only true 2 getting minutes in the rotation, the rest are shared by Melton and Jones operating together. 

Backup Big: Grizzlies rotation of big men is JV, JJJ, BC, plus minutes from hill and crowder as backup 4s. Having a backup C or stretch 4 to take some of Hill's minutes or cover any injuries to JV could be important late this season. 

Possible Target: Malik Beasley? 

Trade: Mason Plumlee, Malik Beasley for Andre Iguodala and one of Bruno Caboclo/Grayson Allen/2nd round pick.

Iggy brings playoff experience to the nuggets who are in contention to win it all. The rest is filler to boost the trade value slightly/make the roster spots work.

I have attempted to provide an answer using 538's team ratings.

The team ratings are based on the RAPTOR player ratings. This means that each team rating depends on which players are available to play. 538 provide two team ratings for every team: ""Current Rating"" and ""Full-Strength Rating.""

&gt;Current is what we’re using for the team’s next game and includes all injuries or rest days in effect at the moment. Full-strength is the team’s rating when all of its key players are in the lineup, even including those who have been ruled out for the season.

I have taken these two ratings and subtracted the Current Rating from the Full-Strength Rating for every team, for every day of the season so far (the data is updated at least daily). I've referred to this below as Team Rating Difference. I am interpreting this difference as 538's opinion on the effect of missing players for that team on that day.

With this data, I wanted to look at two things: which teams have been affected the most this season, and which team was the most affected in the game between the Blazers and the Raptors.

# The season so far

This table shows the average (mean) of each team's daily Full-Strength Rating minus their Current Rating. So the team with the largest number is the one that (on average) has the lowest Current Rating relative to their Full-Strength Rating (i.e. the team most affected by injuries). I've also included this as a percentage of their Full-Strength Rating.

&amp;#x200B;

|Team|Mean Team Rating Difference|As % of Full-Strength Rating|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Golden State Warriors|204.0|13.0%|
|Brooklyn Nets|105.4|6.8%|
|Portland Trail Blazers|94.1|5.9%|
|Indiana Pacers|70.6|4.5%|
|Toronto Raptors|47.3|2.9%|
|Los Angeles Clippers|43.7|2.6%|
|New Orleans Pelicans|41.5|2.7%|
|Atlanta Hawks|38.7|2.7%|
|Orlando Magic|34.0|2.2%|
|Chicago Bulls|30.0|2.1%|
|Boston Celtics|26.2|1.6%|
|Detroit Pistons|26.0|1.8%|
|Philadelphia 76ers|25.9|1.5%|
|Los Angeles Lakers|25.3|1.5%|
|Washington Wizards|25.2|1.7%|
|Oklahoma City Thunder|22.9|1.5%|
|Milwaukee Bucks|22.8|1.3%|
|Miami Heat|21.3|1.4%|
|New York Knicks|20.2|1.6%|
|Utah Jazz|19.4|1.2%|
|Dallas Mavericks|16.5|1.0%|
|Sacramento Kings|9.6|0.6%|
|Phoenix Suns|8.0|0.5%|
|Charlotte Hornets|4.6|0.3%|
|Minnesota Timberwolves|4.2|0.3%|
|San Antonio Spurs|0.9|0.1%|
|Memphis Grizzlies|\-0.1|\-0.0%|
|Denver Nuggets|\-0.2|\-0.0%|
|Cleveland Cavaliers|\-0.8|\-0.1%|
|Houston Rockets|\-3.6|\-0.2%|

It's not a surprise to see the Warriors and the Nets at the top, given their long-term injuries to key players. Then the Blazers haven't had Nurkic and the Pacers haven't had Oladipo. The Raptors are the most affected team that haven't had an individual player out for the whole of the season so far.

For the squabble between Blazers fans and Raptors fans, it's clear that (according to this metric) the Blazers have been affected by injuries more than the Raptors have.

And it's interesting to see that on average the Rockets, Cavs, Nuggets and Grizzlies have had a better Current Rating than their Full-Strength Rating. This must come down to injuries to players that 538 think would be in the rotation were they healthy, but who make the team worse.

# Blazers vs Raptors

To compare these two teams for their game last night, I only need to look at the team rating difference for one day. However, I'm not sure whether I should be looking at the scores for the day of the game, or for the day before.

So, here are the ratings for January 6th 2020:

|Team|Team Rating Difference|As % of Full-Strength Rating|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Toronto Raptors|163.6|9.9%|
|Portland Trail Blazers|105.7|6.7%|

And here are the ratings for January 7th 2020:

|Team|Team Rating Difference|As % of Full-Strength Rating|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Toronto Raptors|137.5|8.3%|
|Portland Trail Blazers|105.6|6.7%|

The change in the Team Rating Difference for the Raptors is the result of a change in their Current Rating rather than their Full-Strength Rating (which does sometimes change). This is probably a matter of recalibrating expectations about who is available to play. For example, Norman Powell and Fred Van Vleet weren't likely to play, but the exact probability wasn't clear.

Either way, 538 thinks that the Raptors were more affected by injuries for that game.

# Current standings

This is the full table for January 8th 2020:

|Team|Mean Team Rating Difference|As % of Full-Strength Rating|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Golden State Warriors|244.6|16.0%|
|Brooklyn Nets|156.7|10.2%|
|Toronto Raptors|137.7|8.3%|
|Portland Trail Blazers|102.6|6.5%|
|Washington Wizards|100.9|7.0%|
|Orlando Magic|85.3|5.5%|
|Oklahoma City Thunder|73.2|4.7%|
|New Orleans Pelicans|70.2|4.5%|
|Indiana Pacers|69.2|4.5%|
|Utah Jazz|43.4|2.7%|
|Houston Rockets|41.1|2.4%|
|Detroit Pistons|39.9|2.8%|
|Chicago Bulls|38.2|2.6%|
|Boston Celtics|27.3|1.7%|
|Los Angeles Lakers|23.5|1.4%|
|Cleveland Cavaliers|20.1|1.5%|
|Philadelphia 76ers|19.8|1.2%|
|Dallas Mavericks|14.7|0.9%|
|Miami Heat|12.6|0.8%|
|Sacramento Kings|11.3|0.8%|
|Charlotte Hornets|5.3|0.4%|
|Los Angeles Clippers|0.0|0.0%|
|Memphis Grizzlies|0.0|0.0%|
|New York Knicks|0.0|0.0%|
|San Antonio Spurs|0.0|0.0%|
|Milwaukee Bucks|\-3.0|\-0.2%|
|Minnesota Timberwolves|\-4.9|\-0.3%|
|Atlanta Hawks|\-5.2|\-0.4%|
|Phoenix Suns|\-7.3|\-0.5%|
|Denver Nuggets|\-9.8|\-0.6%|

The Nuggets currently have a higher Current Rating than their Full-Strength Rating. Looking at their breakdown by player, this seems to come from taking Bol Bol's 5 minutes away and giving them to Jokic and Plumlee. Bol Bol has been out all season. It's interesting that 538's idea of a full-strength team can include a player who hasn't played this season and who apparently makes the team slightly worse. I wonder what data they're basing his inclusion on.

# Thoughts

I think this is a decent way to summarise the effects of injuries, but I'd be keen to hear any criticisms or suggestions. I'd also be interested to look into what happens when a player returns from injury. Is there a period where they are playing, but not to their normal standard? Does this show up in the data?

DAL might also add their GSW 2nd round pick (projected 31-35th) if necessary.

Why 76ers Would do this? They need shooting really badly, Simmons and Embiid need to be surrounded by good shooters to be maximized and while Harris is decent enough both THJ and Seth are truly elite shooters for the role PHI needs them to play. Seth’s level of shooting is obvious as a career 43% 3pt shooter. THJ is a bit less obvious as a career 35% 3pt shooter but that’s mainly due to how bad he is when he creates for himself. This season with DAL he started shooting poorly when he was coming off the bench and mostly trying to create his own shot, however he got moved to the starting line-up after an injury and has been shooting incredible playing next to Luka. In the last 20 games as a starter he has been shooting 44% from 3 on 7.2 attempts per game! I think playing next to another great playmaker like Simmons and having Joel and Al draw the defenses attention will allow him to get similar looks and make it much harder to defend the 76ers.

PHI also needs more depth, this is beyond just a regular season concern since they don’t really have any bench players that could be trusted in deep playoff runs. Thybulle and Korkmaz may have been good this year but they’re both really young and inexperienced which will be a bigger issue in the playoffs. Seth and THJ could provide 55ish minutes of reliable playoff basketball compared to 40ish that Tobias would bring. Seth also has a decent bit of playmaking ability allowing him to run the 2nd unit when Simmons sits.

Finally, PHI would get more flexibility going forward changing 1 large contract into 2 smaller ones, the THJ contract expires at the end of the 20-21 season (or end of this year if he doesn’t pick up his player option) and the Seth contract at 8m$/year is very tradable going forward.

The biggest drop-off for PHI would be on the defensive end but I don’t think this would be horrible either. Seth and especially THJ are better defenders than they get credit for, their biggest struggles comes when they try to defend bigger guards or wings since they can easily get out-powered. This limitation would be minimized playing with the 76ers since in most situations they would be guarding the opposing team’s smallest player, which they can do a decent job with.

Why would the Mavericks do this? Their biggest issue in my opinion is wing defense, their only legit wing defender is DFS but even he is on the smaller side to deal with the larger wings. Tobias Harris is a great fit for that role since he has the size and defensive ability to deal with wings. Currently DAL has the best offense in the NBA and a below average defense (17th), with Tobias Harris they could have a starting/closing line-up of Luka, DFS, Tobias Harris, Dwight Powell (or Maxi) and KP. This line-up doesn’t feature much elite defensive talent (KP has potential to get there) but they would be bigger than their opponent at every position which should allow them to at least be good (10th ish) on that end.

Their offense wouldn’t get much worse either even though Harris to THJ would be a downgrade in terms of pure shooting. Tobias would have the same level of gravity as THJ due to is versatility and reputation which is the biggest thing Luka needs to run the PnR. Further-more he could be the secondary playmaker of the Mavs starting line-up which is a role he excelled at with the Clippers and one that Carlisle loves to have.

For the Mavs this would basically be the move to get their 3rd star next to Luka and KP. Historically, even when Dirk was playing at an MVP level they couldn't get star free agents so this might not be a bad idea. With a top offense in the league, an above average to good defense, they could be a true contender for the next 5 years starting next year.

There is only one team with a W/L record between .430 and .621 and that is OKC (.568) because this season, there happens to be a clear and massive gap between teams who are good and teams who are bad. While all of the good teams sit comfortably in playoff positions, we are nearing the All-Star Break and the Western conference has seven teams battling it out to secure that 8th seed.

Those teams from 8th to 14th are the San Antonio Spurs, Portland Trailblazers, Memphis Grizzlies, Sacramento Kings, Minnesota Timberwolves, Phoenix Suns, and New Orleans Pelicans.

**Some facts:**

In the 2019 Western Conference, the current win percentages of SAS, POR and MEM would be good for 12th behind the 36 win Timberwolves. The win percentages of SAC, MIN, PHO, and NOL would all rank around 14th ahead of the 19 win Suns.

The gap between the 8th seed BKN (.444) and the 9th seed CHA (.385) is bigger than the gap between the 8th seed SAS (.429) and the 13th seed PHO (.378)

The gap between the 7th seed OKC (.568) and the 8th seed SAS (.429) is bigger than the gap between the 8th seed SAS and the 14th seed NOL (. 324).

The 8th seed SAS have played the least amount of games (35) in the WCF and have the 2nd worst road record behind GSW. Unfortunately, their next four games are @ BOS, @ MEM, @ TOR and @ MIA.

Of all the 8th seed contenders, MEM and NOL are the only two teams with a winning record in their last 10 games i.e the two teams who weren’t expected to compete at all this season are in the hottest form.

#So a lot of teams are equally bad? Why is it the most exciting thing in the NBA right now?

The chasm between good and bad teams this season means that the best 12 teams are near guaranteed a playoff spot already (and OKC is sitting pretty), so we’re just waiting for the seeding to reveal themselves and to see which players are going to distinguish themselves for the end of season awards. The real season for those 12 teams now starts in April where they need to end strong for a good seed and make sure they get past the 1st round. 

Whereas with the seven 8th seed rivals? Every regular season game has serious stakes already. 

Who can upset the big boys? Who will beat their rivals? Who will break away and who will cement a lottery pick? Recent upsets like the Grizzlies over Clippers, Spurs over Bucks, Trailblazers over Raptors and Pelicans over Rockets, Nuggets and Pacers have immediate ramifications today in a battle that may last for another 3 months.

Also, the closeness of these seven teams is reflected in the competitiveness and excitement of their matchups. With Derozan/LMA, Dame/Melo, Ja/JJJ, Fox/Bagley, Wiggins/KAT, Booker/Ayton and Lonzo/Ingram, you have duos who are former/recent All-Stars or potential All-Stars in waiting so top notch individual performances are not hard to find. As these teams are in a league of their own, it also provides ample opportunities to assess how certain players/teams do in meaningful game situations. Their head 2 head record could decide who gets to even have a postseason.

**Here are the last 8 games between the 8th seed rivals:**

SAC 114 - 103 PHO with Suns losing a 10pt lead in the 4th quarter

MEM 119 - 112 MIN with Ja putting up 25/7

MEM 121 - 114 PHO with Booker putting up 40 points

NOL 117 - 115 SAC with that JJ Redick gamewinner

SAC 128 - 123 MEM with Fox putting up 27/9

PHO 122 - 116 POR with Dame and Booker putting up 33 points

MIN 105 - 104 SAC with an OT 1 point win for the Timberwolves

NOL 102 - 94 POR with Melo putting up 23/9

# Their next 15 games

Below, I will elaborate on every relevant team’s situation and list out their next 15 games.

NOTE: I will also make a distinction between .568+ teams, 8th seed rivals and ‘the rest’ who  are 10 teams who do not fall into either group. While GSW, ATL, NYK and CLE all have terrible records,  ORL (.459), BKN (.444), CHA (3.85), DET (.368), CHI (.351) and WAS (.333) all have win percentages that are flat out better or similar to the seven 8th seed rivals. ‘The rest’ =/= the worst teams in the NBA.

#Current 8th seed - San Antonio Spurs (15-20, .429)

**Last 10 games:** 5 Ws over BKN, MEM, DET, GSW, MIL - 5 Ls to HOU, LAC, MAV, OKC, MIL

**Summary:** After a dismal November where Spurs went 4-12, a lot of people were concerned that their 20 year long playoff streak would finally end. The turning point came at the beginning of December, when Spurs had four straight OT games. They won three of them and their form started to improve. They have a tough run of games coming up, but with the recent stellar performances from Derozan, the guiding eye of Pop and the bipolar form of their 8th seed rivals, the Spurs find themselves back in the playoffs hunt

Next 15 games:

- 8 games vs .568 teams: @ Celtics, @ Raptors, @ Heat, Heat, Raptors, Jazz, @Clippers, @ Lakers

- 4 games vs 8th seed rivals: @ Grizzlies, @ Pelicans, @ Suns, Suns,

- 3 games vs the rest: Hawks, @ Bulls, Hornets

It’d be cool if they make playoffs because: to paraphrase Ned Stark, there must always be a Spur in the postseason

It’d be cool if they miss playoffs because: Derozan and LMA are not a win-now team and their last lottery pick wasn’t too shabby so shutting it down now could be a wise move.

#Current 9th seed - Memphis Grizzlies (16-22, .421)

**Last 10 games:** 6 Ws over SAC, OKC, CHA, LAC, PHO, MIN - 4 Ls to CLE, SAS, DEN, SAC

**Summary:** This incredibly young team went 5-13 to start the season with #2 pick Ja Morant emerging as the ROY frontrunner. After a crazy missed dunk that nearly ended Kevin Love’s career, Morant and this young Grizzlies team starting pairing promising performances with impressive wins. 27 year old Valanciunas is the elder statesmen  of the very new young core of Morant/JJJ/Clarke/Brooks. With the Grizzlies having the joint easiest 15 game run of all the contenders, this surprising team is a credible dark horse to secure that 8th seed.

Next 15 games:

- 5 games vs .568 teams: Rockets, @ Celtics, Nuggets, @ Mavs, @ Sixers

- 4 games vs 8th seed rivals: Spurs, Pelicans, Suns, @ Pelicans,

- 6 games vs the rest: Warriors, Cavaliers, @ Pistons @ Knicks, Pistons @ Wizards

It’d be cool if they make playoffs because: they’d likely be the youngest playoff roster of all-time.

It’d be cool if they miss playoffs because: having a top lottery pick may be more valuable in the long-term than a first round sweep.

--------------------------------------------

#Current 10th seed - Portland Trailblazers (16-22, .421)

**Last 10 games:** 4 Ws over ORL, MIN, WAS, TOR - 6 Ls to NOL, UTA, LAL, PHO, NYK, MIA

**Summary:** Portland and Minnesota drew the short straw by being in the North West division because that’s the only WCF division that has three .560 teams. After being the second team to lose the G-League Warriors in early November, it was apparent that all was not well in Portland. After injuries to three starters in Hood, Collins and Nurkic, Carmelo Anthony was called in as a last resort but their form hasn’t improved much. With the most brutal schedule of all the 8th seed contenders coming up, it’ll take something special for Portland to be in the 8th seed come early February.

Next 15 games:

- 11 games vs .568 teams: Bucks, @ Mavericks, @ Dallas, @ Thunder, Mavericks, Pacers, Rockets, @  Lakers, Jazz, @ Nuggets, Jazz

- 2 games vs 8th seed rivals: @ Timberwolves, Spurs

- 2 games vs the rest: Hornets, Warriors

It’d be cool if they make playoffs because: everyone needs more Dame time in their life.

It’d be cool if they miss playoffs because:  they already have good prospects in Anfernee Simons and Nassir Little. If they tank for a lottery pick now, then they won’t have to tank later once Dame has left his prime.

----------------------------------------

#Current 11th seed - Sacramento Kings (15-23, .395)

**Last 10 games:** 3 Ws over MEM, GSW, PHO - 7 Ls to MEM, HOU, MIN, PHO, DEN, LAC, NOL

**Summary:** Sacramento started this season with a 0-5 losing streak. They then went on a 12-9 streak. After that, they then went on a 0-8 losing streak. And then after THAT, they are now 3-1 in their last four games. After their supposed breakout season last year, many Kings fans are struggling with the transition back to mediocrity. Though with De’Aaron Fox back and balling, Richaun Holmes is good now and Marvin Bagley making his way back, Sacramento’s ridiculous emotional rollercoaster is set to continue as they face a tough run of games.

Next 15 games:

- 9 games vs .568 teams: Bucks, Mavericks, @ Jazz, @ Heat, Thunder, @ Clippers, Lakers, Heat, @ Bucks

- 3 games vs 8th seed rivals: @ Timberwolves, Timberwolves, Spurs

- 3 games vs the rest: Magic, @ Pistons, @ Bulls

It’d be cool if they make playoffs because: the Kings haven’t made the playoffs since 2006.

It’d be cool if they miss playoffs because: N/A. They last got knocked out of the playoffs by a 29yo Tim Duncan. It wouldn’t be cool.

-----------------------------------------

#Current 12th seed - Minnesota Timberwolves (14-22, .389)

**Last 10 games:** 4 Ws over SAC, BKN, GSW, CLE - 6 Ls to DEN, POR, GSW, CLE, MIL, MEM

**Summary:** After going 10-8 to start the season, the Timberwolves went on a miserable 0-11 losing streak. They’ve picked it up in the last two weeks but it still hasn’t been pretty. With eight of their last 10 games coming against below .500 teams, their record of only 4 Ws is disappointing. On the bright side, KAT has missed 10 games straight which makes the underwhelming form more understandable. On the less bright side, Minnesota are near-tied with Portland for the toughest upcoming run of games.

Next 15 games:

- 10 games vs .568 teams:  Rockets, Thunder, Pacers, @ Pacers, Raptors, Nuggets, Rockets, Thunder, @ Clippers, Clippers

- 3 games vs 8th seed rivals: Trailbazers, Kings, @ Kings,

- 2 games vs the rest: @ Bulls, Hawks

It’d be cool if they make playoffs because: it should incentivise KAT to stay around.

It’d be cool if they miss playoffs because: as long as they’re in the race until the end of the season, it should incentivise KAT to stay around.

------------------------------

#Current 13th seed - Phoenix Suns (14-23, .378)

**Last 10 games:** 3 Ws over SAC, POR, NYK - 7 Ls to OKC, HOU, DEN, GSW, LAL, MEM, SAC

**Summary:** After going 11-12 to start the season, Phoenix went on a 0-8 game losing streak. Like Sacramento and Minnesota - two other young teams hoping to make a breakthrough - the team has suffered from missing Ayton, Rubio and Baynes at various points in the season but things are starting to look up. After 25 games out, 2018 #1 Pick Deandre Ayton is back and is already averaging 16/12 on 59 TS% in his last four games. Oubre Jr and Booker are on a crazy hot scoring streak. Rubio and Baynes are healthy and contributing. They have the joint easiest next 15 games of all 8th seed contenders so the immediate future may be bright for the Suns.

Next 15 games:

- 6 games vs .568 teams: Celtics, Pacers, @ Mavericks, Thunder, @ Bucks, Rockets

- 3 games vs 8th seed rivals: Spurs, @ Spurs, @ Grizzlies,

- 6 games vs the rest: Magic, Hornets, @ Hawks, @ Knicks, @ Nets, Pistons,

It’d be cool if they make playoffs because: it will make Booker happy.

It’d be cool if they miss playoffs because: as long as they’re in the race until the end of the season, Suns won’t be seen as a joke anymore and Phoenix fans can have good reason to be optimistic about their future.

--------------------------------------------------------

#Current 14th seed - New Orleans Pelicans (12-25, .324)

**Last 10 games:** 6 Ws over MIN, POR, DEN, IND, HOU, SAC - 4 Ls to BKN, GSW, LAL, UTA

**Summary:** Do not rule out New Orleans just yet from the 8th seed race. They are the biggest dark horse of all the 8th seed contenders. While their upcoming run of games isn’t easy, their last 15 games of the season includes 14 teams with a losing record. After going 6-22 to start the season, they have gone 6-4 in their last ten. Those four losses are mostly encouraging as they include an OT loss to Brooklyn, a 10 point loss to 1st seed Lakers, a 2 point loss to Utah and a disappointing 4 point loss to GSW. Things have changed. Ingram, who has broken out this season, has received recent help in the shape of a sharpshooting Lonzo Ball and a returning Derrick Favors. With Zion Williamson back in training and reported to debut this season, the Pelicans might be peaking at the perfect time.

Next 15 games:

- 7 games vs .568 teams: @ Celtics, Jazz, Clippers, Nuggets, Celtics, @ Rockets, Bucks

- 3 games vs 8th seed rivals: @ Grizzlies, Spurs, Grizzlies

- 5 games against the rest: Bulls, @ Knicks, @ Pistons, @ Cavaliers, @ Bulls

It’d be cool if they make playoffs because: AD/Lebron vs Lonzo/Ingram/Zion in the first round would be so much fun

It’d be cool if they miss playoffs because: they’re a young team who have missed their generational rookie all season. No-one expected them to compete after Zion’s injury.

With the Kings short handed last night, Dedmon was on the floor for almost the entire second half, helping lead a 21 point comeback win. He looked very good defensively and competent on offense. He’s owed $15M for this season and the following two, with only $1M guaranteed in the final year.

Personally I felt that the Kings weren’t a great fit for his skill set and that he never got enough opportunity there. However, I do think his contract is a negative asset, paying any center $15M is hard to justify. That mean SAC may have to attach assets to get him out. It’d would be a very tough look for Vlade, but he did almost the exact same thing with George Hill.

--------------------------

As a 2015 thread asking who will be the better player in 2020, I thought it’s about time to revisit this thread. Let’s see who people thought would be the better player in 2020, and actually discuss who the better player is now.

This post from the 2015 offseason said:

&gt; Basically list two young players and people will respond with who they think will be better in 5 years.

The format for this thread will contain a context section so you can get a sense of what was going on at the time the OP was posted. 

Afterwards, I’ll highlight certain comparisons that I thought were interesting, post their 2015 counting stats to give an idea of what they were producing at at the time and quote some of the more articulate responses from the thread below.

----------------------------------

**Context for August 2015:**

Warriors won their first ring vs Lebron’s Cavs. Steph had an MVP. Kawhi won his first DPOY. Draymond was  DPOY-runner-up. Wiggins was ROY

Russ had won the scoring title but wasn’t a serious MVP candidate due to team record and missing too many games.

Durant and PG had missed a lot of time during the 2015 season due to injury.

AD was in his third season, Gobert and Noel were sophomores while Nurkic was a rookie.

Kyrie had just finished his first year playing with Lebron. Lillard and Aldridge got knocked out in the first round by Memphis.

2015 draft happened recently. The top 4 picks were KAT, Russell, Okafor and Porzingis.

#Comparisons

---------------------------------------

|Player|Age|G|TS%|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|PTS|
|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|
|Paul George|24|6|.492|3.7|1.0|0.8|0.2|8.8|
|Kawhi Leonard|23|64|.567|7.2|2.5|2.3|0.8|16.5|

Someone said:
&gt;Before this past season I would have said George, but looking at the way Kawhi improved this past season, It's probably him now.

&gt;Look, I know people want to say that George is a better and more complete offensive player, but you're not looking at the context of PG's breakout season. Vogel gave him and Stephenson almost complete control of the offense. Put Kawhi in the same role, and I suspect his contribution on offense would be similar.

&gt;Look at Kawhi this past season. Pull up threes, turnaround jumpers, eurosteps, and a back-to-the-basket game. That's more than what I could say for PG. He's one of my favorite players, but his offense is literally straight line drives, pull-up jumpers, and transition buckets.

&gt;It's hard to compare the two on defense because PG just missed a season, and a big part of defense is experience, and maybe PG might have been a better defender if he played. All I'll say is that Leonard is a DPOY while only playing 64 games, and PG was 7th place in his best defensive season.

And /u/sharksfanabroad said

&gt;They're not that hard to compare; similar experience (Kawhi has 252 regular season games to PG's 292) and similar position.

&gt;Kawhi has the better career TS% (.583 to PG's .545), but has benefited from the lower usage rate (18.3% to PG's 23.4%). Also, with Kawhi's increasing role, we're seeing a decline in his TS%; can't be as efficient when becoming more of an offensive focal point.

&gt;The win shares are even, but WS/48 favors Kawhi. Despite some counting stats benefiting PG (since his offensive output is high; usage rate), the advanced stats suggest that Kawhi is better defensively while PG gets more assists.

&gt; I guess my answer is ""don't bet against the Spurs"". They seem to know what they're doing with their talent; not exhausting them, and doing the best to prove that longevity as a top-tier player is better than a couple of seasons as a top-5 player.

-------------------------------------

|Player|Age|G|TS%|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|PTS|
|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|
|Anthony Davis|21|68|.591|10.2|2.2|1.5|2.9|24.4|
|Kevin Durant|26|27|.633|6.6|4.1|0.9|0.9|25.4|

Someone said

&gt;I think it will be AD. He is a better defender who can be a 28p/12r/4a/3b/2s guy and dominate the league with his inside and developing outside game. If he really adds the corner 3 or spotup 3 to his game I think he won’t be much worse on O but will be much better on D because he can guard 1-5 for a possession and has DPOY potential. Also he is the man everybody thinks LeBron will pass the torch to as being the best player in the league.

Another said

&gt; Anthony Davis. Kevin Durant will be 32 and his athleticism will begin to decline, but still is a top 10, maybe top 5 player in the league. Davis will be the best player in the league (unless Wiggins is Kobe/Jordan 2.0, but we can't tell yet).

&gt; Anthony Davis to me will become Karl Malone who's an even better defender... god damn. Hope he gets a point guard to feed him like Stock fed the Mailman. I will be very disappointed if I have to watch Davis get mid 2000s Kobe'd and have a shit team around him.

/u/ztejas rebutted that

&gt; Durant is a generational talent and 32 is not that old. Especially for a 6'10"" player that is one of the best shooters in NBA history. Go look at any all-time-great's stats at 32. Jordan, Kobe, Bird, Hakeem, Magic, Malone. They were all still great and still top 5 players at 32. Some of them were the best player in the league. LeBron is going to be 31 next year, and he will still either be the best or 2nd best to KD. Davis is the only young gun that is probably a safe bet to be on the same level as Durant at some point in his career. Thinking that there will be 5 players that have surpassed KD in 5 years is pretty empty speculation.

This is the season after Steph’s 1st MVP but before his 2016 MVP. Below is a quickfire of different one-liners from that comment thread.

&gt; Durant, younger (by a few months) and already better.

&gt; KD’s not much younger, but still, KD's already the better player by far. Shit man, people really have forgotten about him

&gt; Durant is the second best player in the NBA when he’s playing.

&gt; Curry won't improve anymore aside from perhaps better assist stats.

&gt; Curry. I don't think we've seen his final form yet.

Someone said

&gt;In 5 years they will both be 32 (Westbrook will actually be 31 and 10 months). Westbrook won't be nearly as athletic as he is now which his game relies heavily on. Steph is at an advantage there as he relies on his athleticism much, much less.
Another person said

&gt;One player's game is meant for 32 years of age while the other's most definitely isn't. Lebron is the greatest athlete possibly ever in the NBA and even he looks like he lost a step this year. That's at 30, imagine two extra years on a player who isn't super durable like bron

Someone said

&gt; In 5 years, they'll both be #1 options, but Kyrie will have 5 years of running a top-5 offense under his belt alongside great support and probably the best mentor anyone in the league right now could ask for. If I had to invest in one player to cash in 5 years from now, it would definitely be Kyrie.

Another said

&gt;Dame's two years older. He got to play with one of the best floor spacing bigs in Aldridge and had decent 3pt shooting on the wings.

&gt;Kyrie played with verajo, Thompson, Bennett and Tyler zeller as his bigs. He had dion waiters, Alonzo gee, Jarrett jack and cj miles as his wings. There is not much shooting there, Bennett never developed, zeller just started hitting mid range in Boston, Andy was always hurt, jack had a terrible year, and well dion...

&gt;Still they averaged similar ppg and FG %. Dames a good player, but Irving is just better. He has all the tools, sweet 3pt stroke, ability to score in the paint (he finishes near the top FG % inside 6 feet for PG's) and some say the best handles in the league. He has the size, 6'3, and the athleticism to become a good defensive player and showed improvement last year.

While /u/irelli replied to the above with

&gt;Nope, Lillard definitely doesn't have a sweet 3pt stroke. No way he's led the league in deep 3s (30+ feet) since he came in the league.

&gt;Lillard finished better from inside 5 feet this year than Kyrie did, and on a higher volume too. Lillard: 59.9 % / Kyrie: 56.7 %. Lillard is six three too. We have set plays that end in a Lillard alley oop so I’d say Lillards a bit more athletic. Anyway, Kyries real advantage is that he's a much better  ball handler and a more acrobatic finisher. I would just take all those other things over his handles.

Someone said

&gt; It's like comparing Vlade Divac to Ben Wallace. One's a solid two way starter, but the other can completely anchor your defense. Got to go with the guy who is elite at something rather than good at two things.

Another said

&gt; Its Gobert. I will take elite defense, at an already young age, and still improving offense. Gobert is already maybe the best defensive center in the NBA, and he's still getting better. Nurkic is raw as hell, and could be a very good player, but give me Gobert 7 days a week, and twice on Sunday.

Finally, someone said

&gt; Nurkic may be more skilled but IMO Gobert is more effective because of his athleticism and length. But sure, I'll concede the offense to Nurkic. However Gobert's effect on the D side is just so great that it destroys Nurkic's advantage on O. The Jazz went from no. 21 defence to top 3 after they traded Kanter.

A lot of people commented on how close they found this comparison at the time.

Someone said

&gt; This is the hardest one in here for me... Gobert's 9'9 standing reach is ridiculous and 7 inches higher than Noel's. Gobert has already proven that he can make a huge improvement from one year to another, which we have yet to see if Noel can. I think Noel has a higher ceiling but Gobert is more likely to be better of the two in 5 year

Another said

&gt; Noel. I think he's a actually a better defender, he was top 10 in both bpg and spg. Also, while he has not shown much improvement on the offensive side, it is something that he has said he is working hard at. I think Gobert will just be a slightly better Tyson Chandler

/u/deknegt1990 replied to the above with

&gt; Chandler was a DPOTY candidate in most of his years, player with phenomenal heart, grit, and determination.

&gt;Remember that Chandler had the potential to be one of the best centers in the league barring DH, the only thing that derailed that was his injuries. Once he got to a team where he was healthy and happy, he was a beast. Mavs won a ring partly due to the ridiculous defensive load he carried.

&gt; I'd love to see Gobert reach Chandler levels, minus the injuries he'll be a beast.

Someone mentioned that

&gt; Numbers show that Gobert is the better defender. He allowed the lowest % at the rim as a starter and was third in blocks. He's faster, longer and now stronger than Noel. I have no doubt Noel with be the better Offense/Defensive combo

And finally someone said

&gt; Noel because Gobert pretty much reached his ceiling already. He was the best rim protector and overall defensive terror last year, he cannot improve on that. On offense and perimeter defense he is who he is. All in all pretty good package but looking forward five years Noel might be better. He has the potential for much more versatility on both sides.

And another said

&gt; Towns. I think he will be a great second peice to a championship team and can play a lot of ways.

&gt;Okafor will be a player who gets 23ppg on a shitty team and cant be the go to guy on a 50 win team and has a playstyle that makes teams now want him

Ibaka, who is only 7 months older than Draymond, was still a year away from getting drafted to the Magic for Dipo, Ilyasova and Sabonis. Draymond was a DPOY runner-up and had just won his first ring.

Here are some one liners.

&gt; Anyone debating this just imagine Ibaka on the Warriors instead of Draymond. They are literally just as good and would likely be better.

&gt; Ibaka is way better

&gt; Ibaka is better right now than Dray could ever even hope to be

&gt; Wait... So like an elite player or near elite player vs. a a guy that fits well in a championship team? Hmmmmm. Hard one

&gt; Goddamn Dray is so overrated now

Someone replied to the above with

&gt; Well one of them was a DPOY runner up and integral cog in a finals winning offense and the other didn't make the playoffs

Someone said

&gt; Comparable defense yeah but Ibaka is nowhere near as useful offensively as Green. Ibaka is supposed to help carry the water for his team as a third option but I've seen many a Thunder game where he couldn't get that 20-10.

&gt;Draymond on the other hand was actively engaged in one of the best offenses and defenses of last season.

&gt; Ibaka is a better fit for the Thunder and Green is a better fit for the Warriors. Chemistry matters
Another poster said

&gt;I'd take Draymond as a top-20 player in the league, and probably closer to top-15. I think his ability to defend centers and truly guard positions 2-5 makes him one of the most versatile and most useful players in the NBA. He completely changes your offense and defense and is the prototype for new the ideal NBA big. I think Ibaka is an excellent player, but Draymond's skillset is so much more rare that I'll take him any day of the week.

That number rises to 9 for the 2017 All-NBA Teams, and doesn’t include notable travelers such as Boogie Cousins, Kristaps Porzingis and Chris Paul.\n\nTermed the *Player Empowerment Era* by many, this period features more player agency than ever before. Basketball was once a sport where greats of the game retired young to [pursue banking careers](https://www.nba.com/hawks/news/Catching_Up_With_Bob_Pettit_032905.html). Now, stars sign contracts worth hundreds of millions and partner with former AAU and college teammates to create dynamic duos and big threes. Superteams are created via DM, not through a GM’s phone.\n\nThose playing in the modern NBA stand on the shoulders of giants, the power afforded to them the result of a long line of union action, holdouts, trade requests and arm-twisting. Below is a non-exhaustive history of player empowerment in the NBA, a collection of trends from 1946-now.\n\n# Early Days\n\nThe NBA’s (then the BAA) inaugural game took place on 1 November 1946, where the New York Knicks beat the Toronto Huskies 68-66. Personnel changes shortly followed. The first swap in NBA history occurred on 2 December 1946, when the Knicks [traded 6’6 Center Jake Weber for Providence Steamrollers star Cash Considerations](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/weberja01.html). A talent whose skills were first minted in Washington D.C., Considerations has since been involved in more trades than any other player.\n\nThe Cleveland Rebels and Toronto Huskies swapped Kleggie Hermsen and George Nostrand 2 days later, while Pittsburgh Ironmen coach Paul Birch shipped forward Moe Becker to Boston on December 12 after a falling-out, in possibly the league’s first personality-driven trade.\n\nOverall, the early NBA was free of trade drama as players performed under shorter contracts and had little negotiating power. This changed as the next generation washed through the league.\n\n# Celtics at the Center\n\nLike many NBA innovations, the trade demand can be traced back to the Boston Celtics. The 1950 Draft featured two future Celtic Hall-of-Famers, neither of whom were selected by newly installed coach Red Auerbach. 16th overall pick Bill Sharman was averaging 12.2 points per game as a rookie when his Washington Capitols squad folded after 35 games. When the Fort Wayne Pistons selected Sharman in the mid-season dispersal draft, he ran off to play for the Brooklyn Dodgers minor league team. He was traded to Boston before the start of the following season.\n\nBut it was Sharman’s backcourt partner, the diminutive son of poor French immigrants by the name of Bob Cousy, who made sweeping changes to player power. LeBron and Durant weren’t the first to align on- and off-court interests. In 1950 the Houdini of the Hardwood was [establishing a driving school](https://www.nba.com/bob-cousy-10-things-know) close to his Holy Cross home. His new team, the Tri-Cities Blackhawks, were based in Moline and Rock Island, Illinois and Davenport, Iowa, a distance far too great to continue operations. When the Blackhawks chose not to compensate him for this loss of income (a salary increase of $6,000 to $10,000 a season), [Cousy held out](http://www.celtic-nation.com/interviews/bob_cousy/bob_cousy_page5.htm). He was traded to the Chicago Stags, who folded, and then selected by the Celtics in a dispersal draft.\n\nThe first explicit trade request may have been from Celtics big Ed Macauley. Then a 6-time All-Star and 3-time All-NBA First Team selection, Easy Ed asked to be moved to St. Louis [to be closer to his ill son.](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/being-easy/) Auerbach and Celtics owner Walter Brown obliged him, sending him on his way along with future All-Star Cliff Hagan in exchange for a rookie center by the name of William Felton Russell (I\'ll save the story of the NBA\'s social pioneers for another time). Empowering these early stars, the Celtics set the stage for future exercises of player autonomy.\n\n# The NBPA\n\nCousy became a founder and the inaugural President of the National Basketball Players Association in 1954. Commissioner Maurice Podoloff initially disregarded the union, and while a threatened strike in 1957 forced him to the negotiating table, owner-player relations remained frosty.\n\nFast forward to the 1964 All-Star game, the first to be televised. Now led by President (and Celtic) Tommy Heinsohn and unhappy with their treatment by new Commissioner J. Walter Kennedy, the players barricade themselves in the locker room. Their demands, previously ignored by the Board of Governors, include a pension plan, increased training support staff, and improved playing conditions. Lakers owner Bob Short yells through the locker room door, “Tell Elgin Baylor if he doesn’t get out there, he’s through.” Baylor stays put, Jerry West backs him, and the rest of the room follows suit. Kennedy and the owners give in. The threatened strike, which delays the game by a mere 15 minutes, is an integral step in legitimizing the union and player power. (For more on the formation of the Players Union, see the 4th chapter of Michael Schiavone’s book *Sports and Labor in the United States*).\n\n# Increased Player Autonomy and ""[Blank] to L.A.""\n\nMuch like today, the Lakers of the late ‘60s and ‘70s were a threat to steal generational talent. In 1965 the greatest offensive force to ever grace the hardwood, Wilt Chamberlain, was shifted from financially struggling San Francisco to the Philadelphia 76ers. In 1968, now an NBA Champion and the league leader in both rebounding and assists, Chamberlain takes destiny into his own hands. With that, the Lakers are the beneficiary of the NBA’s first superstar-driven trade. Whichever reason you accept for the trade – a yearning to be part of a stable and winning franchise, teaming up with two all-timers in West and Baylor or his desire to live in a city [where a black man could date white women](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=pSavBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA202&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;dq=wilt+trade+white+women&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xOjnUCtiom&amp;sig=ACfU3U2GaLyUYN66VwhH6rdrOdefEpMU5w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjI0ZfuqOfmAhW3zTgGHSZhCb4Q6AEwGXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=wilt%20trade%20white%20women&amp;f=false) – to that point Chamberlain was the biggest star to force a move to a contender. (Fun fact, Wilt was almost shipped straight from the Warriors to the Lakers [much earlier](https://www.nytimes.com/1964/12/24/archives/trade-of-chamberlain-to-lakers-is-denied.html)).\n\nCompletely unlike today, the Knicks were a desirable destination in the early ‘70s. Both Wilt and Kareem flagged New York as a desirable destination, and Earl Monroe became one of the first young stars to force a trade when he jumped ship from the rival Baltimore Bullets just 3 games in to his 5th season.\n\nKareem followed Wilt’s lead in 1975. Kareem’s 6 years in Milwaukee had been fruitful. The Bucks won a title and 69.5% of their games with the “Tower from Power”, and their marquee big brought home 3 MVPs and a Finals MVP. Unlike Wilt he was not motivated by a dispute with coaches or ownership, the prospect of a superstar team-up or a sure title. Instead, Kareem – a towering intellectual, proud African-American and man of Muslim faith – [did not feel welcome in Milwaukee](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-12-25-sp-21142-story.html). While an important step in player empowerment – never had the NBA’s best player fought to change teams *in his prime* – the move crystallized the still-prevalent fear that small-market organizations would lose talent to bigger metropolitan cities.\n\n# Rise of the ABA, Free Agency and the Merger\n\nThe ABA’s stylistic influence on the modern NBA is matched by its effect on player power. Unlike the NBA, the ABA allowed the drafting of underclassmen (and the odd [prep wonder](https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=m9VjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dX8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6951%2C6991325)). The [legal success](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/401/1204/) of Spencer Haywood, the Sonics and the ABA against the NBA and NCAA removed the standing requirement that an NBA draftee be four years removed from high school graduation and paved the way for the [current draft eligibility rules](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/30/sports/basketball/spencer-haywood-rule-nba-draft-underclassmen.html).\n\nThe rise of a legitimate rival to the NBA also increased the negotiating power of established players. In 1967 Rick Barry was fresh off a sophomore season in which he averaged 35.6 points per game and took his Warriors team to within two wins of an NBA title. Not content with his $30,000 salary or his owner’s negotiation style, Barry jumped ship. He joined the ABA’s Oakland Oaks (coached by his college coach and father-in-law Bruce Hale) for a 3-year, $500,000 contract and a 15% team ownership stake. While a [court order](https://www.nytimes.com/1967/08/09/archives/warriors-upheld-on-option-clause-court-rules-barry-is-bound-to-club.html) forced him to sit out the next season, Barry’s move put the NBA on notice.\n\nIf the ‘70s were a litigious basketball sundae, then *Robertson v National Basketball Association* is the lawsuit cherry on top. Prior to 1976, NBA contracts contained reserve clauses, which gave teams a perpetual right to a player after his contract ended. This right lasted for his entire career unless he was traded or sat out an entire season to sign elsewhere. In 1970 union President Oscar Robertson brought a suit against the NBA alleging that the reserve clause violated antitrust law. The Courts ruled in his favour [in 1976](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/556/682/69049/), ending an injunction preventing an NBA-ABA merger and effectively creating NBA free agency.\n\nThe post-merger NBA presented with its own troubles. Stars of different leagues and styles were now thrown together with fewer roster spots, minutes and money to split between them, and the new ability to move freely between employers until satisfied. The ‘77 Blazers, a generational group built on a selfless team game, were dismantled entirely not even 2 seasons later. After an injury-shortened, MVP-winning regular season in ‘78, Bill Walton took painkillers and suited up for a first-round match-up against Seattle. An x-ray taken after Game 2 revealed that Walton had played with a broken bone below his left ankle. Outraged at medical staff incompetence and unethical practice, Walton demanded a trade that off-season. When no trade eventuated, one of the game’s great centers sat out the entire 1978-79 season and signed with San Diego the following year (read Halberstram’s *Break of the Game* if you already haven’t).\n\n# The Players Take Control\n\nThe game grew enormously through the 80s and 90s, stimulated by increased cultural cache (thanks to the exploits of Magic, Bird and Jordan) and cash flow brought in through newly signed TV deals. Stars, now more recognizable than ever, [began raking in endorsements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkXkrSLe-nQ). To better regulate team spending during the post-merger flux, the NBA instituted a salary cap for the 1984-85 season. Whether due to the money, the media or the model of those before, player-initiated movement became increasingly common. Even if we didn’t have a term for it at the time, the concept of player empowerment was truly born in the ‘90s.\n\nSpurred by a pre-rookie scale spike in salary, younger players began to exert negotiating power earlier and more flagrantly than ever. Having finished his first season as the NBA\'s highest-paid player, Derrick Coleman requested a trade from [New Jersey](https://www.si.com/vault/1995/10/23/209264/derrick-coleman-the-controversial-forward-talks-about-the-raps-against-him-and-his-rap-on-the-nets). Upon landing in Philly, he almost immediately began broadcasting his desire to play for a contender.\n\nDisgruntled talent became younger and younger as the era wore on. Alonzo Mourning [wriggled his way to South Beach](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-11-04-sp-64760-story.html) in search of a pay raise, while Stephon Marbury [wanted to go home](https://products.kitsapsun.com/archive/1999/03-12/0071_trades__marbury_to_nets__brandon_.html). Chris Webber [exercised a sophomoric escape clause](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1995/10/11/webber-hits-the-jackpot/86fa2f81-243e-42b5-8233-87f8cd72acc3/) and Steve Francis [threatened to hold out before signing his rookie deal](https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1999-08-28-9908280022-story.html). Others like Kenny Anderson [simply refused to report to their new teams](https://www.si.com/vault/1998/03/02/239451/hell-no-they-wont-go-with-traded-players-like-kenny-anderson-balking-at-reporting-to-their-new-clubs-general-managers-are-left-to-ponder-their-options). Some exercised it with newfound negotiating savvy, others with incompetence, and Latrell Sprewell, [well](https://sports.jrank.org/pages/4535/Sprewell-Latrell-Tarnished-Reputation.html)...\n\nNot that the veterans were setting a flawless example of heartfelt team loyalty. All-timers [Charles Barkley](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/18/sports/basketball-bright-day-for-suns-they-get-barkley.html) and [Hakeem Olajuwon](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-03-31-sp-231-story.html) both requested trades in 1992, Dennis Rodman played contender bingo jumping from Detroit to [San Antonio](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-10-02-sp-41479-story.html) to [Chicago](https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/03/sports/pro-basketball-unhappy-rodman-is-dealt-from-spurs-to-the-bulls.html) to [L.A.](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1999-02-24-9902240270-story.html), and even seven-time All-Star [Jack Sikma](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-05-30-8602100035-story.html) got in on the action. Late 90s ring-chasers (notably Rockets best buds [Pippen](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/02/sports/pro-basketball-rockets-are-sending-pippen-to-trail-blazers-for-six-players.html) and [Barkley again](https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/19/sports/barkley-confirms-his-trade-to-rockets.html)) didn’t help growing negative perceptions of player disloyalty.\n\n# Lockout and Rethink\n\nThe view of a league that was young, brash and overpaid was, in part, paired with public misunderstanding of the NBA’s hip-hop era. A brief work stoppage in 1996 belied much bigger problems than a middle-aged fan’s discomfort with chains and baggy pants.\n\nThe primary issue during the 1998-99 lockout was that of the ballooning player salaries, and the loopholes which teams were both willfully and reluctantly jumping through to retain talent. The 204-day lockout brought many of the key salary rules that govern the NBA today. The rookie pay scale, maximum salary and duration for contracts, a raised minimum salary, two new exemptions (at an average- and median-salary), the luxury tax and restrictions on the Bird exception were all first signed in to the post-lockout CBA (see Paul D. Staudohar’s [summary](https://www.bls.gov/mlr/1999/04/art1full.pdf)).\n\nPost-lockout trade demands were often drawn out and extremely unpopular when they did happen. Vince Carter was reviled in Toronto for years after [submarining the Raptors](https://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs2007/columns/story?id=2843733), while Kobe’s excursions into [free agency](https://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=1840336) and [trade](https://www.espn.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/3446/kobe-bryant-says-he-d-like-to-be-traded) [demands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKI8K7GP3NM) were thankfully overshadowed by the delivery of Pau Gasol and two titles.\n\n# The Decision and Another Lockout\n\n[Carmelo Anthony](https://www.espn.com.au/nba/story/_/id/8252042/sources-dwight-howard-los-angeles-lakers-four-team-deal-complete) and [Dwight Howard](https://www.espn.com.au/nba/story/_/id/8252042/sources-dwight-howard-los-angeles-lakers-four-team-deal-complete) may have had been at the center of high-profile trades, but one ‘10s transaction stands alone. The biggest free agent signing since [Shaq](https://apnews.com/6aeb186d105f54b4b873c2dc0868ffaa), LeBron’s move to Miami shook the league up like few off-court moments ever have or will. There are many great pieces on The Decision (Bryan Curtis’ [2018 work](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/7/2/17524572/lebron-james-the-decision-miami-heat-2010) is a personal favorite) so I’ll leave this short: growing up in a 6-ringed, Jordan-shaped shadow, LeBron’s move felt like the first star free agency move primarily and explicitly driven by legacy. From 2010-on every trade requested or contract signed was a decision about both basketball and brand. Successfully weathering a period as one of the world’s most disliked athletes and returning to the general public’s good graces, LeBron paved the way for later free agency moves from Durant, Kawhi and others.\n\nThe 2011 lockout brought a few minor, yet important changes. Simply put, the owners claimed they were losing money, and wanted a more even split of basketball related income (players had 57% at that point). This is the most notable instance of players losing ground in a union-league conflict. Other agreed changes included the [Derrick Rose rule](http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q58) and the further reduction of max contract length. Unlike the previous lockout, players were proactive in finding ways to keep fit. Many signed internationally, most notably All-Star Deron Williams with Turkish side [Beşiktaş](https://www.espn.com/new-york/nba/story/_/id/6774378/), prompting brief hysteria about European teams snatching LeBron/Kobe-tier players.\n\nThe final key salary cap rule change of the last decade is the Supermax rule. Negotiated during the 2016 CBA Negotiations, teams may re-sign players who meet [certain experience, award and other criteria](http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q24) to 35% of the salary cap. Teams and players have differed in their decisions to offer and accept/reject it respectively, and a determination of the Supermax’s success is worthy of both its own analysis and a longer trial period. For today’s purposes, note that Anthony Davis, Paul George and Kawhi Leonard effectively turned down the Supermax when they requested trades. Such decisions suggest two things. Firstly, there may be a point where increases in salary are no longer a factor in a player’s decision to sign. Secondly, players are making decisions not primarily motivated by financial gain. Further analysis of both these points should prove useful.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe NBA is experiencing a period characterized by regular player movement. Higher yearly salaries, shorter contracts and increases in off-court opportunities have all contributed to the rise in player movement in the past decade. The most recent off-season, where approximately 40% of the league entered free agency, may prove this trend’s zenith or set a new norm. Players are valuing security, ensuring their current contract and almost immediately positioning for their next (or for a trade). Increased salaries now seem to be approaching a point where further increase has negligible impact on player decisions compared to non-monetary factors, particularly among max-level players.\n\nWhile the origins of the Player Empowerment Era are evident in the ‘90s, players of the late ‘10s and early ‘20s have shown the ability to negotiate and brand-manage with far greater strategy and savvy. The sheer number of today’s players and stars changing teams may be unprecedented but, given the NBA’s historical trends, is not unexpected or unforeseeable.', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 15 2018 All-NBA Team selections announced 18 months ago, 7 have since changed teams.

His new team, the Tri-Cities Blackhawks, were based in Moline and Rock Island, Illinois and Davenport, Iowa, a distance far too great to continue operations. When the Blackhawks chose not to compensate him for this loss of income (a salary increase of $6,000 to $10,000 a season), &lt;a href=""http://www.celtic-nation.com/interviews/bob_cousy/bob_cousy_page5.htm""&gt;Cousy held out&lt;/a&gt;. He was traded to the Chicago Stags, who folded, and then selected by the Celtics in a dispersal draft.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first explicit trade request may have been from Celtics big Ed Macauley. Then a 6-time All-Star and 3-time All-NBA First Team selection, Easy Ed asked to be moved to St. Louis &lt;a href=""https://www.slamonline.com/nba/being-easy/""&gt;to be closer to his ill son.&lt;/a&gt; Auerbach and Celtics owner Walter Brown obliged him, sending him on his way along with future All-Star Cliff Hagan in exchange for a rookie center by the name of William Felton Russell (I&amp;#39;ll save the story of the NBA&amp;#39;s social pioneers for another time). Empowering these early stars, the Celtics set the stage for future exercises of player autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The NBPA&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cousy became a founder and the inaugural President of the National Basketball Players Association in 1954. Commissioner Maurice Podoloff initially disregarded the union, and while a threatened strike in 1957 forced him to the negotiating table, owner-player relations remained frosty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to the 1964 All-Star game, the first to be televised. Now led by President (and Celtic) Tommy Heinsohn and unhappy with their treatment by new Commissioner J. Walter Kennedy, the players barricade themselves in the locker room. Their demands, previously ignored by the Board of Governors, include a pension plan, increased training support staff, and improved playing conditions. Lakers owner Bob Short yells through the locker room door, “Tell Elgin Baylor if he doesn’t get out there, he’s through.” Baylor stays put, Jerry West backs him, and the rest of the room follows suit. Kennedy and the owners give in. The threatened strike, which delays the game by a mere 15 minutes, is an integral step in legitimizing the union and player power. (For more on the formation of the Players Union, see the 4th chapter of Michael Schiavone’s book &lt;em&gt;Sports and Labor in the United States&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Increased Player Autonomy and &amp;quot;[Blank] to L.A.&amp;quot;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Much like today, the Lakers of the late ‘60s and ‘70s were a threat to steal generational talent. In 1965 the greatest offensive force to ever grace the hardwood, Wilt Chamberlain, was shifted from financially struggling San Francisco to the Philadelphia 76ers. In 1968, now an NBA Champion and the league leader in both rebounding and assists, Chamberlain takes destiny into his own hands. With that, the Lakers are the beneficiary of the NBA’s first superstar-driven trade. Whichever reason you accept for the trade – a yearning to be part of a stable and winning franchise, teaming up with two all-timers in West and Baylor or his desire to live in a city &lt;a href=""https://books.google.com.au/books?id=pSavBAAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA202&amp;amp;lpg=PA202&amp;amp;dq=wilt+trade+white+women&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=xOjnUCtiom&amp;amp;sig=ACfU3U2GaLyUYN66VwhH6rdrOdefEpMU5w&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjI0ZfuqOfmAhW3zTgGHSZhCb4Q6AEwGXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=wilt%20trade%20white%20women&amp;amp;f=false""&gt;where a black man could date white women&lt;/a&gt; – to that point Chamberlain was the biggest star to force a move to a contender. (Fun fact, Wilt was almost shipped straight from the Warriors to the Lakers &lt;a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/1964/12/24/archives/trade-of-chamberlain-to-lakers-is-denied.html""&gt;much earlier&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Completely unlike today, the Knicks were a desirable destination in the early ‘70s. Both Wilt and Kareem flagged New York as a desirable destination, and Earl Monroe became one of the first young stars to force a trade when he jumped ship from the rival Baltimore Bullets just 3 games in to his 5th season.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kareem followed Wilt’s lead in 1975. Kareem’s 6 years in Milwaukee had been fruitful. The Bucks won a title and 69.5% of their games with the “Tower from Power”, and their marquee big brought home 3 MVPs and a Finals MVP. Unlike Wilt he was not motivated by a dispute with coaches or ownership, the prospect of a superstar team-up or a sure title. Instead, Kareem – a towering intellectual, proud African-American and man of Muslim faith – &lt;a href=""https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-12-25-sp-21142-story.html""&gt;did not feel welcome in Milwaukee&lt;/a&gt;. While an important step in player empowerment – never had the NBA’s best player fought to change teams &lt;em&gt;in his prime&lt;/em&gt; – the move crystallized the still-prevalent fear that small-market organizations would lose talent to bigger metropolitan cities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Rise of the ABA, Free Agency and the Merger&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ABA’s stylistic influence on the modern NBA is matched by its effect on player power. Unlike the NBA, the ABA allowed the drafting of underclassmen (and the odd &lt;a href=""https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=m9VjAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;sjid=dX8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;pg=6951%2C6991325""&gt;prep wonder&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href=""https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/401/1204/""&gt;legal success&lt;/a&gt; of Spencer Haywood, the Sonics and the ABA against the NBA and NCAA removed the standing requirement that an NBA draftee be four years removed from high school graduation and paved the way for the &lt;a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/30/sports/basketball/spencer-haywood-rule-nba-draft-underclassmen.html""&gt;current draft eligibility rules&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rise of a legitimate rival to the NBA also increased the negotiating power of established players. In 1967 Rick Barry was fresh off a sophomore season in which he averaged 35.6 points per game and took his Warriors team to within two wins of an NBA title. Not content with his $30,000 salary or his owner’s negotiation style, Barry jumped ship. He joined the ABA’s Oakland Oaks (coached by his college coach and father-in-law Bruce Hale) for a 3-year, $500,000 contract and a 15% team ownership stake. While a &lt;a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/1967/08/09/archives/warriors-upheld-on-option-clause-court-rules-barry-is-bound-to-club.html""&gt;court order&lt;/a&gt; forced him to sit out the next season, Barry’s move put the NBA on notice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the ‘70s were a litigious basketball sundae, then &lt;em&gt;Robertson v National Basketball Association&lt;/em&gt; is the lawsuit cherry on top. Prior to 1976, NBA contracts contained reserve clauses, which gave teams a perpetual right to a player after his contract ended. This right lasted for his entire career unless he was traded or sat out an entire season to sign elsewhere. In 1970 union President Oscar Robertson brought a suit against the NBA alleging that the reserve clause violated antitrust law. The Courts ruled in his favour &lt;a href=""https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/556/682/69049/""&gt;in 1976&lt;/a&gt;, ending an injunction preventing an NBA-ABA merger and effectively creating NBA free agency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The post-merger NBA presented with its own troubles. Stars of different leagues and styles were now thrown together with fewer roster spots, minutes and money to split between them, and the new ability to move freely between employers until satisfied. The ‘77 Blazers, a generational group built on a selfless team game, were dismantled entirely not even 2 seasons later. After an injury-shortened, MVP-winning regular season in ‘78, Bill Walton took painkillers and suited up for a first-round match-up against Seattle. An x-ray taken after Game 2 revealed that Walton had played with a broken bone below his left ankle. Outraged at medical staff incompetence and unethical practice, Walton demanded a trade that off-season. When no trade eventuated, one of the game’s great centers sat out the entire 1978-79 season and signed with San Diego the following year (read Halberstram’s &lt;em&gt;Break of the Game&lt;/em&gt; if you already haven’t).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The Players Take Control&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The game grew enormously through the 80s and 90s, stimulated by increased cultural cache (thanks to the exploits of Magic, Bird and Jordan) and cash flow brought in through newly signed TV deals. Stars, now more recognizable than ever, &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkXkrSLe-nQ""&gt;began raking in endorsements&lt;/a&gt;. To better regulate team spending during the post-merger flux, the NBA instituted a salary cap for the 1984-85 season. Whether due to the money, the media or the model of those before, player-initiated movement became increasingly common. Even if we didn’t have a term for it at the time, the concept of player empowerment was truly born in the ‘90s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spurred by a pre-rookie scale spike in salary, younger players began to exert negotiating power earlier and more flagrantly than ever. Having finished his first season as the NBA&amp;#39;s highest-paid player, Derrick Coleman requested a trade from &lt;a href=""https://www.si.com/vault/1995/10/23/209264/derrick-coleman-the-controversial-forward-talks-about-the-raps-against-him-and-his-rap-on-the-nets""&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;. Upon landing in Philly, he almost immediately began broadcasting his desire to play for a contender.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disgruntled talent became younger and younger as the era wore on. Alonzo Mourning &lt;a href=""https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-11-04-sp-64760-story.html""&gt;wriggled his way to South Beach&lt;/a&gt; in search of a pay raise, while Stephon Marbury &lt;a href=""https://products.kitsapsun.com/archive/1999/03-12/0071_trades__marbury_to_nets__brandon_.html""&gt;wanted to go home&lt;/a&gt;. Chris Webber &lt;a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1995/10/11/webber-hits-the-jackpot/86fa2f81-243e-42b5-8233-87f8cd72acc3/""&gt;exercised a sophomoric escape clause&lt;/a&gt; and Steve Francis &lt;a href=""https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1999-08-28-9908280022-story.html""&gt;threatened to hold out before signing his rookie deal&lt;/a&gt;. Others like Kenny Anderson &lt;a href=""https://www.si.com/vault/1998/03/02/239451/hell-no-they-wont-go-with-traded-players-like-kenny-anderson-balking-at-reporting-to-their-new-clubs-general-managers-are-left-to-ponder-their-options""&gt;simply refused to report to their new teams&lt;/a&gt;. Some exercised it with newfound negotiating savvy, others with incompetence, and Latrell Sprewell, &lt;a href=""https://sports.jrank.org/pages/4535/Sprewell-Latrell-Tarnished-Reputation.html""&gt;well&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not that the veterans were setting a flawless example of heartfelt team loyalty. All-timers &lt;a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/18/sports/basketball-bright-day-for-suns-they-get-barkley.html""&gt;Charles Barkley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-03-31-sp-231-story.html""&gt;Hakeem Olajuwon&lt;/a&gt; both requested trades in 1992, Dennis Rodman played contender bingo jumping from Detroit to &lt;a href=""https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-10-02-sp-41479-story.html""&gt;San Antonio&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/03/sports/pro-basketball-unhappy-rodman-is-dealt-from-spurs-to-the-bulls.html""&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=""https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1999-02-24-9902240270-story.html""&gt;L.A.&lt;/a&gt;, and even seven-time All-Star &lt;a href=""https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-05-30-8602100035-story.html""&gt;Jack Sikma&lt;/a&gt; got in on the action. Late 90s ring-chasers (notably Rockets best buds &lt;a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/02/sports/pro-basketball-rockets-are-sending-pippen-to-trail-blazers-for-six-players.html""&gt;Pippen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/19/sports/barkley-confirms-his-trade-to-rockets.html""&gt;Barkley again&lt;/a&gt;) didn’t help growing negative perceptions of player disloyalty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Lockout and Rethink&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The view of a league that was young, brash and overpaid was, in part, paired with public misunderstanding of the NBA’s hip-hop era. A brief work stoppage in 1996 belied much bigger problems than a middle-aged fan’s discomfort with chains and baggy pants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The primary issue during the 1998-99 lockout was that of the ballooning player salaries, and the loopholes which teams were both willfully and reluctantly jumping through to retain talent. The 204-day lockout brought many of the key salary rules that govern the NBA today. The rookie pay scale, maximum salary and duration for contracts, a raised minimum salary, two new exemptions (at an average- and median-salary), the luxury tax and restrictions on the Bird exception were all first signed in to the post-lockout CBA (see Paul D. Staudohar’s &lt;a href=""https://www.bls.gov/mlr/1999/04/art1full.pdf""&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Post-lockout trade demands were often drawn out and extremely unpopular when they did happen. Vince Carter was reviled in Toronto for years after &lt;a href=""https://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs2007/columns/story?id=2843733""&gt;submarining the Raptors&lt;/a&gt;, while Kobe’s excursions into &lt;a href=""https://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=1840336""&gt;free agency&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://www.espn.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/3446/kobe-bryant-says-he-d-like-to-be-traded""&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKI8K7GP3NM""&gt;demands&lt;/a&gt; were thankfully overshadowed by the delivery of Pau Gasol and two titles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The Decision and Another Lockout&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.espn.com.au/nba/story/_/id/8252042/sources-dwight-howard-los-angeles-lakers-four-team-deal-complete""&gt;Carmelo Anthony&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://www.espn.com.au/nba/story/_/id/8252042/sources-dwight-howard-los-angeles-lakers-four-team-deal-complete""&gt;Dwight Howard&lt;/a&gt; may have had been at the center of high-profile trades, but one ‘10s transaction stands alone. The biggest free agent signing since &lt;a href=""https://apnews.com/6aeb186d105f54b4b873c2dc0868ffaa""&gt;Shaq&lt;/a&gt;, LeBron’s move to Miami shook the league up like few off-court moments ever have or will. There are many great pieces on The Decision (Bryan Curtis’ &lt;a href=""https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/7/2/17524572/lebron-james-the-decision-miami-heat-2010""&gt;2018 work&lt;/a&gt; is a personal favorite) so I’ll leave this short: growing up in a 6-ringed, Jordan-shaped shadow, LeBron’s move felt like the first star free agency move primarily and explicitly driven by legacy. From 2010-on every trade requested or contract signed was a decision about both basketball and brand. Successfully weathering a period as one of the world’s most disliked athletes and returning to the general public’s good graces, LeBron paved the way for later free agency moves from Durant, Kawhi and others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 2011 lockout brought a few minor, yet important changes. Simply put, the owners claimed they were losing money, and wanted a more even split of basketball related income (players had 57% at that point). This is the most notable instance of players losing ground in a union-league conflict. Other agreed changes included the &lt;a href=""http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q58""&gt;Derrick Rose rule&lt;/a&gt; and the further reduction of max contract length. Unlike the previous lockout, players were proactive in finding ways to keep fit. Many signed internationally, most notably All-Star Deron Williams with Turkish side &lt;a href=""https://www.espn.com/new-york/nba/story/_/id/6774378/""&gt;Beşiktaş&lt;/a&gt;, prompting brief hysteria about European teams snatching LeBron/Kobe-tier players.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The final key salary cap rule change of the last decade is the Supermax rule. Negotiated during the 2016 CBA Negotiations, teams may re-sign players who meet &lt;a href=""http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q24""&gt;certain experience, award and other criteria&lt;/a&gt; to 35% of the salary cap. Teams and players have differed in their decisions to offer and accept/reject it respectively, and a determination of the Supermax’s success is worthy of both its own analysis and a longer trial period. For today’s purposes, note that Anthony Davis, Paul George and Kawhi Leonard effectively turned down the Supermax when they requested trades. Such decisions suggest two things. Firstly, there may be a point where increases in salary are no longer a factor in a player’s decision to sign. Secondly, players are making decisions not primarily motivated by financial gain. Further analysis of both these points should prove useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The NBA is experiencing a period characterized by regular player movement. Higher yearly salaries, shorter contracts and increases in off-court opportunities have all contributed to the rise in player movement in the past decade. The most recent off-season, where approximately 40% of the league entered free agency, may prove this trend’s zenith or set a new norm. Players are valuing security, ensuring their current contract and almost immediately positioning for their next (or for a trade). Increased salaries now seem to be approaching a point where further increase has negligible impact on player decisions compared to non-monetary factors, particularly among max-level players.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While the origins of the Player Empowerment Era are evident in the ‘90s, players of the late ‘10s and early ‘20s have shown the ability to negotiate and brand-manage with far greater strategy and savvy. The sheer number of today’s players and stars changing teams may be unprecedented but, given the NBA’s historical trends, is not unexpected or unforeseeable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'steward_reports': [], 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'nba', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2qo4s', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/nba', 'subreddit_subscribers': 2944113, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': None, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'thumbnail_height': None, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'title': '[OC] A Brief History of Player Empowerment', 'total_awards_received': 0, 'ups': 1, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/elsfex/oc_a_brief_history_of_player_empowerment/', 'user_reports': [], 'view_count': None, 'visited': False, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}]",,,,,,,,,,

What were people saying about them? How high were they expected to be drafted? How did people think they would do in the NBA? 

I'm starting with the 2018 draft trio of Trae, Luka and Deandre. The Luka Doncic and Deandre Ayton editions are nearly complete so I'm posting the Trae Young thread now while I finish the other two. The Luka and Ayton threads should be posted soon.

Summary - It seems Trae was famous in state but kind of unknown on the national stage relative to other top prospects. There was some debate about where he'd fall in the lottery but his crazy start at Oklahoma got him a lot of attention. Most doubted Trae because of his size but a lot of people recognized that he was an offensive force who might just play himself into a spot as a top 5 draft pick.

&gt;Dude's pretty undersized when compared to an average NBA PG. And a lot of people are predicting Trae to declare after his sophomore season, so that's why he's not picking up much steam yet. He's a pretty good leader and fearless scorer though, if I have to say.

Selected comment from /u/walterdog12:

&gt;This year, I just think the top 5 is too stacked for him to get into that conversation unless he plays at the level we've seen him play in games, and does it for the rest of the season and makes some noise in their conference tournament and in the NCAA tournament. But as of right now, Ayton, Bagley, Doncic, Porter, and Bamba are all clearly the top 5 prospects barring any injuries happening or just an absolute collapse by any of them. There's been so much hype around those 5 that they're seen basically on another level than any other prospect atm.

&gt;Plus if you read into his scouting reports a bit and what scouts/coaches had to say about him as a player, it sounds like he needs the ball in his hands and basically has to be the focal point of the offense for him to be effective. Apparently a reason a lot of coaches backed off of him in recruiting down the stretch was cause they were worried that he wouldn't play well with other players of his equal talent level cause the way he plays currently, requires him to be a black hole on offense (of course, I say this the night he gets 22 assists).

&gt;The only player that would make me rethink about drafting Young with our pick would be Doncic and MAYBE Ayton.

&gt;Not to mention Trae Young already hangs out with our players in the summer. He flew private jet to Las Vegas with Booker, TJ Warren and Alan Williams.

&gt; He quotes Booker as a role model and Steve Nash as his favorite player.

&gt; Trae Young is pretty much the personification of a typical Suns style player imo.

Selected comment from thread:

&gt; I feel like the Curry comparisons aren't really justified... if you watch Trae play, he seems to lack the quickness and skill at finishing around the rim that Steph had, even in college. Steph's 3-point shooting is so godlike that whenever a college player shoots lights out from deep they get compared to Curry, but Steph's ability to get to the basket is also elite and Trae doesn't have that at all.

They're deep in the rebuilding process, and probably looking to form a contender around their three-guard lineup of Sexton, KPJ, and Garland (as long as they pan out). Obviously they need some help from big men, and I think if Nance takes another step up he could be valuable for them, but dealing for an expiring (and massive) contract could be a good move, and would allow them to add another big or two in the coming offseason. Having Whiteside's 28 mil or so and Brandon Knight's 15 mil going off the books would put them in a fun position along with another high draft pick.

On to Portland- it's been well-documented how a hometown reunion with Kevin Love could be in the cards, and I think this would be their opportunity to do so. With Love's clear unhappiness in Cleveland, it's time for him to make a change, and heading to Portland, with Nurkic coming back from injury, could create a very competitive team in the West. A lineup of Dame, CJ, (Simons/Bazemore), Love, and Nurkic, with Melo coming off the bend would be a fun team to watch in the playoffs. Sure, the Love contract isn't ideal, but he has siginificant playoff experience, and the Dame/CJ combo aren't getting any younger. It's time for Portland to make a big swing, and this could be their chance. 

Thoughts? I'm not sure if a straight swap is something the teams would necessarily be interested in, but getting Whiteside to the East and Love to the West could work well.

Al Horford from the 76ers to Utah for Mike Conley Jr

The money works

## Why the Jazz make this Trade

Mike Conley has been out with injury since early December, and prior to that he was struggling greatly to integrate into Utah’s offense. While it would seem logical to continue to roll with this team and try to make things work with Conley once he returns, I would strongly look at moving Conley if I’m Utah.

Since December 4th (Conley’s initial injury), the Jazz have gone 12-3 and crafted a 113.9 offensive rating, the fourth best mark in the league during that span. With Conley in the lineup Utah owns a bottom ten offense in the league.

To be fair, Utah has played an easier schedule since Conley has gone down, but the sample size and on court product provide overwhelming evidence that the Jazz may be better off moving on from Conley. With the current run they are on, they could negatively impact their playoff seeding trying to make the offense work with Conley. With Conley out, Donovan Mitchell has been given much more on-ball opportunity and the offense has run primarily through him. He’s a capable shooting guard, but it’s become clear during his young career that he best projects as a lead ballhandler.

Conley there minimizes the amount of control that Mitchell has over the offense, and I think with the results we’ve gotten from the past month, I’d roll the dice and keep moving with this format. For reference, Mitchell has been much more efficient and expanded his playmaking abilities since starting at the point (24.5/4.8/3.6 on 43.5%FG/36.9%3pFG/83%FT with Conley to now 25.6/4.1/5.5 on 50.2%/34.8%/85.7%). Mitchell’s Assist/Turnover ratio has actually improved which is great considering that he’s gone from a secondary to primary creator. These numbers, as well as watching Utah, shows that Mitchell has been able to get his shot and finish inside with much better efficiency now that he has more room to operate.

Joe Ingles has slid back into the starting lineup and quietly been a primary reason for Utah’s run, as he’s slashing 14.9ppg/4.5rbs/6asts on 51.9%FG/51.6%3pFG/89%FT. Prior he’d been one of the worst offensive players in the league (7.3pts/4.3rbs/3.5 asts on 36.4%FG/30.9% 3pFG/75% FT), and looked like his shot and game was broken.

So why does Horford make sense? The Jazz don’t have a four. They currently deploy Royce O’Neale, Georges Niang, and Bojan Bogdanovic at the second forward spot. While that has been great for their spacing and offensive game, it limits their defensive potential. O’Neale and Bogdanovic are plus defenders but both are much too small to capably defend the premier forwards of the West. Horford provides the defensive versatility that this team gave up when they moved on from Derrick Favors, without clogging up the offense in the same way. There is no one on this roster who can capably defend Anthony Davis (Gobert is not mobile enough, he makes his living at the rim not fifteen feet out) and having Horford gives you a player who can matchup against him.

Horford could also slot in as Utah’s backup center behind Gobert. If their minutes are staggered there are still a great deal of opportunities to go small and play 4 or 5 out.

Yes Horford is older and on a longer contract, but I believe in Quin Snyder to integrate him into the offense in a way that utilizes him as more than just a spot up shooter like has been in Philly. Just imagine the elbow playmaking/two man game that Horford and Mitchell could craft. I dream of offense like that. Horford’s game has never relied on athleticism and while his deal is large, I don’t think his play will fall off dramatically. Even if he greatly declines he’s one of the best vets in the league and could be moved in the future.

## Why the Sixers make this Trade

The Sixers currently run the second least pick n roll in the league. Their halfcourt offense is one of the least watchable things on national television and I cringe everytime the game hits the final three minutes in the fourth quarter. This is what a Philly offensive set looks like in the fourth quarter of a close game; Ben Simmons brings the ball up, passes off to Josh Richardson, J-Rich dribbles for 5 seconds drives in passes out to Harris, Harris drives in has no look and passes out to Embiid in the high post, he gets doubled, passes out to Korkmaz who swings it to Harris who dribbles 6 times and shoots a 19-footer that hits the backboard.

I’m not trying to be harsh, just honest. Ben Simmons is not a point guard. A point guard can run pick and rolls, or some semblance of offense. For whatever reason, he cannot or does not do that. He often brings up the ball and fades away for the possesion, maybe he comes in for a putback or will cut back door, but often he just hangs out in the dunker spot.

Simmons needs to stop being looked at as a guard, and more as a high energy forward with good handles. He’s more like Larry Nance than any kind of guard I can think of. Brett Brown, or maybe a different coach, needs to craft an offense that utilizes Simmons as a screener, cutter, and abuser of mismatches against smaller players. And I think the best way to do that is to bring an a great passer and ball mover like Conley.

By moving on from Horford, Harris can play the four (where he should be/actually fits), Simmons can play up to the three, and Richardson is allowed to slot back as a secondary ballhandler, as he has been the primary creator for this team late in games. Conley who has played with another incredible post finisher in Marc Gasol, would immediately be the best passer that Joel Embiid has ever played with.

He would be able to find Embiid more readily in the post and I believe he would make this offense flow much more smoothly. Embiid is a force and the best weapon this team has. Right now, he’s not being used like it the majority of the time. This team needs to be Embiidcentric, and this is a step towards that. Simmons is incredible as a talent and has loads of potential, but this is a better trajectory for the team to try and win a title now.

Part of the issue for Conley this year has been the awkward fit with Gobert. Gobert is a great pick and roll threat but that’s really it. Embiid is phenomenal as a pick and roll partner and provides more spacing for Conley just with his gravity (defenders will be much less willing to drop off Embiid to cover Conley than they would be to drop off Gobert). Gobert operates within a 5 foot are, Embiid can operate anywhere on the court and while it may not seem like a big difference, this could mean the world for Conley’s at rim finishing.

Horford just has not fit in Philly and has voiced his displeasure with his role on offense. Even if the Conley trade were to not workout, Conley’s deal ends 2 years prior to Horford’s and will be an expiring next year which would be much easier for Elton Brand to stomach.

## The Point

Both of these teams don’t want to make this trade and admit that their big offseason splashes didn’t pan out. But, I think this is one of the rare trades that benefits both teams. Philly and the Jazz have both largely disappointed after being seemingly primed for deep runs in the preseason by the media and their own front office’s. Winning a title requires calculated risks, and gambling with your assets to achieve something greater. It’s ballsy, but I fully believe that this trade is worth it.

In February of last year, the Mavs traded for the young star Kristaps Porzingis from the New York Knicks in a deal centered around acquiring the large contracts of the veterans Courtney Lee and Tim Hardaway Jr from NY. The latter was a controversial topic, since he showed the ability of being a great role-player in Atlanta but was an incredibly inneficient scorer during all of his time with the Knicks. And this perception of him continued in his first stretch of games in Dallas, since he shot 40% from the field and 32% from 3 in his 19 games with the Mavs' uniform last season.

&amp;#x200B;

Donnie Nelson led the way to the signing and re-signing of multiple role-players to get depth in the 2019 offseason, and with that, Hardaway's role with the new squad was a question. He started the season coming off the bench, and, unfortunely for Mavs fans, he continued being a inneficient scorer with questionable shot decisions and overall a negative for the team.

&amp;#x200B;

**Rotation Changes**

&amp;#x200B;

But then, Carlisle had an idea. After 13 games of playing 27-year-old guard with the second-unit (shooting 34% from the field and 29% from 3 in that stretch), Rick introduced Tim to the starting lineup, and it was an immediate success. In the first 5 games of the new rotation, Tim Hardaway averaged 20 points per game in 60% from the field and 61% from 3, with 4 games with 10+ points. That stretch included back-to-back 40+-point wins against the Warriors and Cavs and wins on the road against Phoenix and Houston.

&amp;#x200B;

The key factor to that success was limiting THJ to playing mostly with Luka instead of introducing him with the bench. Even though his stats coming off the bench were terrible, his numbers with Luka were incredible already. When the 20-year-old star was on the floor, Hardaway had a 117.3 ORTG, 98.7 DRTG, +18.7 NETRTG and his TS% was 7 points better. Knowing that, Rick made sure to reduce his minutes without the slovenian guard on the game and made him a starter.

&amp;#x200B;

In the month of December, excluding the 5 games Dončić didn't play with an injury, Tim Hardaway Jr. played 213 minutes WITH Luka on the floor and only 8 WITHOUT him. In comparison, THJ played 225 minutes with Luka but 119 without him in November. Not by coincidence, in the next 11 games as a starter (before the Luka injury), Tim averaged 15.7 points per game in 52/45/92 shooting splits and the Mavs enjoyed a 9-2 record.

&amp;#x200B;

**But why is that the case?**

&amp;#x200B;

Well, a lot of people might be thinking ""Well, no shit that someone plays better when sharing the court with an MVP-caliber player that averages nearly 10 assists a game"", but Tim Hardaway specially benefits from that more than everyone else. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reasons he is having such a good time playing with Luka is that he is playing the catch-and-shoot role, and isn't handle the ball much. In Atlanta and NY, he had a frequency of catch-and-shoot attempts of 38% in average. In that stretch with Luka, the frequency was at 56%. Hardaway has problems when he tries too much on offense and attempts to create by himself. He is not good as a pull-up shooter and shot-creator, and that was the role Rick gave him in his first games in Dallas. 

&amp;#x200B;

As he started to play with an incredibly high-usage guard that is having an MVP-type season, he didn't even have the opportunity to have the ball for long stretches anymore. With now a pure-shooter role, his efficiency got up by a good amount and he became what everyone hoped he would.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, not by coincidence, in the 5 games Luka didn't play with an injury, Tim averaged 18 points per game in 18 attempts and shot only 36% from the field and 37% from 3PT. And in the last 4 games with Luka, he averaged 15 points per game in 10 attempts and shot 55% from the field and 60% from 3PT.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, I'll not try to say his success is only due to the season Dončić is having or because Rick is a great coach. He of course is probably working his ass off to fit with the team and win games. He accepted coming off the bench and even as a starter he accepted a lesser role than the one he had in NY. The new role he has is helping him become the player the Knicks hoped they'd get, and much of that is because of Carlisle and the system he stablished around the european sensation.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,74894,public,self,How Luka Dončić and Rick Carlisle helped Tim Hardaway Jr's recent turnaround and why it isn't only a hot streak,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/eldshl/how_luka_dončić_and_rick_carlisle_helped_tim/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Between Kevin Love's remaining $120M over 4 years on his contract, his injury history/inconsistency, decline in volume scoring ability and offensive rebounding (due to sacrificing this to provide spacing), and atrocious defense, I've come to conclusion that acquiring Love only presents a clear downgrade for most teams rumored to possibly trade for him with the exception of the two teams in this title. He's just not as good as he once was.

Phoenix and Charlotte profile to me as franchises who just want to get to the playoffs regardless of long term risk. They're barely on the outside of the playoff picture at the moment (PHO is 2 games out of the 8th seed; CHA is sitting at 9th in the East), they have the matching salaries and sweeteners to make a trade happen, and both are teams that could benefit in the short term from the addition of  the floor raising talent offensively that Love provides as a dynamic 3PT shooter and talented passer at his position. Phoenix could package Mikal Bridges, Tyler Johnson and a pick in a trade that would only serve to improve the Suns' offense and would provide Cleveland with salary relief (Johnson expires after this season) and young talent in Bridges. Or, in a very similar trade with similar benefits, Charlotte could package Miles Bridges, Nicolas Batum and a pick. I think PHO and CHA would be better off keeping their young guys and continuing to the develop, but I would not be shocked at all to see these deals occur instead.

Next, though, I'd like to outline why he's unlikely to go to the other teams rumored to be in the Love Derby. 

Denver: I believe the only addition this team can make to put them in true contention with other title contenders would be an elite shot creator on the perimeter -- someone more offensively dynamic and consistent than Murray/Jokic/Barton/Harris. Their frontcourt rotation of Jokic/Millsap/Grant/Plumlee is already more than good and balanced enough offensively and defensively, Love's passing and defensive rebounding become redundant on this team with the talent already there, and his addition as a catch and shoot threat just seems too hollow to trade away who they should instead be including in a future trade for someone more helpful to this roster (on top of him being a complete minus on defense).

Portland: On one hand, why not trade Whiteside and an inconsequential draft pick and/or prospect for Love and see where things go next season when Nurkic and Collins are back (this 2019-20 season is most likely a lost year regardless of what they do). However, with the duration and size of Love's contract it basically locks them into this team as constructed with major questions on defense for quite a while. The Blazers have a bonafide superstar in Dame, a very good 2nd creator in CJ, and a very good two-way center in Nurkic if he comes back from injury next season as good as he was before; Love is simply too flawed and injury-prone of a player at his age to be their ""missing piece"" and I believe that acquiring him would most likely end in their window to championship contention being closed. If they're smart, they'd not make any brash trades this season and prioritize defensive-minded wings moving forward. 

Boston: They simply have all of what Love provides on their roster already, and on cheaper deals. The Celtics' only major weakness I can point to is their interior defense and Love is surely not providing that.

Miami: If Miami could benefit from any roster acquisitions, those would be elite shot creation on the perimeter for their inevitable playoff matchups with MIL/PHI/BOS/TOR/IND, or at backup point guard for the games that Dragic misses. Love's shooting would be nice, but he'd make zero sense for this team financially considering they're chasing future free agents. Unless...Cleveland's F.O. has a psychotic episode and takes on their dead salary guys (Waiters/James Johnson) and doesn't expect much else.

Philly: I've seen some Love trade ideas involving moving Horford and bringing in Love to help with their shooting, to which I'd say I value the potential of what could be a historically elite defense in the playoffs if you keep Horford MUCH MORE than improved shooting and worse-everything else by bringing in Love. If Horford is being shopped at all, I'd hope that Philly would only move him for the same shot creator/shooter that Miami and Denver are also in need of.

Raptors: Similar situation here to Philly considering they already have Ibaka and Gasol and I'm not sure that Love's a definite upgrade over either of them whether you're comparing them as individual players or by team impact. Highly doubt Masai makes a move like this that doesn't project to improve their team significantly, and more importantly, ruins their plans for going after Giannis when he's a free agent.

San Antonio: If Love is not fixing their defense on arrival, then I am not sure why they'd deal for him considering he's not any better than LaMarcus Aldridge. I could see a Love-for-Derozan trade happening just to shuffle the decks for both teams...but I highly doubt San Antonio wants to take on that contract seeing how Love's been thus far.

Utah: This would have made some sense earlier if the Jazz would've done something like Exum/Ingles/Davis/Bradley for Love, but after the Exum-for-Clarkson trade I do not see how they'd make the salaries work to get Love to Utah.

This list does not include the more random teams that could acquire him for shits and giggles (looking at you Knicks, Magic, Hawks).

I personally would love to see him traded to Washington, though I don't see the Wizards doing it since they are sort of tanking while Wall is out. But would CLE say to to Troy Brown Jr., Ian Mahinmi &amp; CJ Miles' expiring's for salary filler, and a 2020 1st Rd Pick for Love?

I like reading old /r/nba threads. A lot of them are fascinating. Here’s a fun one that I stumbled across recently.

**The Original Post.**

&gt; Nearly five years had passed between Kobe and Carmelo's 60 point game. Before them only Shaquille O'Neil, Tracy McGrady, Allen Iverson, and Gilbert Arenas had 60 point games since 2000.

&gt;So who do you think has the best chances to drop 60 in the future? I'm not asking when you think it will happen, but what players have the best chance?

&gt;I think obviously Kevin Durant, and Carmelo Anthony are the best scorers in the NBA so they will definitely be high on my list. LeBron is such a freak in terms of size and talent and strength he is definitely up there as well. I think that Russell and Harden could drop 60 as well, dependent on who they are playing. And lastly I think that Curry could drop 60, potentially.

&gt;I think that Wade and Kobe might not be able to due to declines. I think they might hit upper 40s and 50, but I think 60 is a stretch for even Kobe now.

**Most recent 40+ games at the time.**

The original thread was posted on the 25th January 2014, the day after Melo’s 62pt game against Charlotte. It was his thirty-fifth career 40+pt game at that point in time.

Here are the most recent big games (at the time) from the candidates mentioned in the OP.

Durant has thirty-six career 40+pts games at that point in time. In the three weeks prior to this post, KD has scored 48pts vs Minnesota, 48pts vs Utah, 54pts vs Golden State and 46 vs Portland.

Lebron has sixty-one career 40+pt games at that point in time. His last two big games was against Boston when he put up 45 in game 6 of the 2012 ECF and when he put up 40pts vs Sacramento in March 2013.

Westbrook has five career 40+pt games at that point in time. His last two big games was against Miami when he put up 43pts in game 4 of the 2012 Finals and when he put up 45pts vs Minnesota in March 2012.

Harden has three career 40+pt games at that point in time. His last two big games was against Oklahoma when he put up 46pts in April 2013 and when he put up 45pts vs Atlanta in November 2012.

Steph has four career 40+pt games at that point in time. His last two big games was against Charlotte when he put up 43pts in December 2013 and when he put up 47pts vs Lakers in April 2013.

**Added context:**

This is KD’s MVP year.

 Russ missed a lot of time this season due to knee surgery. 

Harden has been at Houston for a season and a half. 

Steph was breaking out and would make his first all-NBA team. 

This is Lebron’s last year with Wade. Wade only played 54 games this season. 

Kobe had returned from his Achilles injury already but had injured his knee vs Memphis in the previous month. 

**So what’s the answer?** 

Here is every 60+pt game since Melo’s 2014 game. The answer to the question was actually Lebron two months later but it’s interesting to see who else has (and hasn’t) hit the 60pt mark in the last six years.

**Would that list be surprising to people in 2014?**

Steph, KD, Harden, Lebron and Melo were popular/common answers and all were recognised as having the potential to put up big numbers in 2014. Harden’s done it four times, Lebron has done it once but Steph and KD both share a career high of 54pts so far. Melo would only hit the 40pt mark five more times in his career and never came close to 60pts again.

Obviously Booker hadn't been drafted yet, but what about Kobe, Klay and Dame? Did anyone see those performances coming in 2014? 

Actually, yes.

--------------------------------

For Dame, someone posted

&gt; Damian Lillard. He has a bright future. 

And another said

&gt; I think Lillard has a better shot at it if he's killing it from 3. I don't see either him or Aldridge actually doing it though

-----------------------------------

For Klay, /u/MarioTheGoat posted

&gt;Dark horse is Klay Thompson. He's a fucking assassin and doesn't get enough recognition because IMHO he has the best shooter in the world on his team. 

And another said

&gt; Klay Thompson. 20-25 from three

---------------------------------

Kobe was actually a really popular choice.

Someone said 

&gt; I'd love to see Kobe just try to do it once before he retires. I think if he REALLY wanted to, he could, on like 50 shots.

And someone else said

&gt; I honestly wouldn't be that shocked if Kobe hit 60 again. Obviously he needs to be healthy, and really just needs a game where they are down (Lakers aren't really that great right now and no one would blame Kobe for taking all the shots with the teammates he has right now) and he's feeling it which happens a lot considering how long he has been playing. Kobe won't shy away from shooting the shit out of the ball so I could see it happening.

----------------------------------------------

And as a final conclusion, here’s an interesting comment from /u/andthatssometrainshit.

&gt;Kevin Durant is an obvious choice, particularly if he plays on a team without Westbrook or another solid number 2 option at some point in his career. Curry, too. Westbrook and Harden can probably do it, but they would need to be on worse teams. Consider the 60 point games that have occurred since 2000-2001.

Its a weird addiction, I cannot explain it. But its a super fun challenge. *Imagine trying to score as many points as possible with Nick Young*. And when you play enough, you start to question whether it would be possible in the actual game. Because you can see it happen in football—you could just run the ball every single possession Navy-Army style and manage to rack up statistics. 

James Harden and the Houston Rockets are testing the limits. An offense that is currently built around the bearded one is succeeding in its goal of getting James Harden the statistics he deserves. But it begs the question, how good is it?

I guess it starts with understanding what the Houston Rockets are currently doing. 

The Mike D’Antoni 7 seconds offense has had an incredible influence on the modern game of basketball, with many adaptions becoming staples today—including the Steve Kerr motion offense. Because of the versatility of the system, it often adapts to the talent around it. For example, back when he was with the Phoenix Suns, it would open up the middle of the court for Steve Nash to showcase his magic and create for the talent around him.

Now, the system has been to space the floor for James Harden to create his shot. 

The new iteration of the offense focuses mostly on the ‘overload’ while still incorporating the “spread around perimeter” layout that was commonly used with Chris Paul. Three will sit on one side, a fourth with sit on the opposite side—high or low depending on the play call or the flow of the transition. Harden or Westbrook will now have the extra space for penetration—which is a good start to the new duo. But reality, this new style has been critical for Clint Cappella, who at times felt lost during stretches last season. Capella still remains a rim rat but what has been a lot better is his spacing when setting the screen and how he’s able to not interrupt a play at the rim. Instead, he has been great this year at timing the rebound, often able to get a put-back dunk off. Wingmen Danuel House, Ben McLemore and Eric Gordon also receive more love in the system. Being able to sit around the wing and expect either a catch and shoot opportunity or have natural space for an iso opportunity. And PJ Tucker is still a corner specialist.

But, we’re focused on Harden. 

Quietly, Harden isn’t seeing that much of a statistical difference in his play. Instead, its been marginal improvement—which is still incredible to see from someone as gifted as him and the statistics he was able to put up both last year and this year. He’s improved to 46.3% from the field (from 44.2), 38.6% from deep (from 36.8%) and is getting to the line +1.3 more times per game, despite a 1.5% dip in his free throw percentage. 

[He’s still able to trail in transition for the three-point attempt](https://youtu.be/hDJ_lGhM0h8?t=168), [he’s still got his pull-up shot](https://youtu.be/38tnk5Y_9tU?t=236). Not much has really changed in what he is able to do. We just expect him to be the best player on the court for the Houston Rockets.

This year in the evolution of James Harden, we’ve seen a faster Houston Rockets—going from a pace of 98.39 in 2017-18 to a 103.90. Surprisingly, they’re the slowest team—averaging a speed of 4.01.The Houston Rockets average the most points per game in transition and can expect to be at the foul time 14.2% of the times in transition. 

Because of the two primary ball-handers run in Houston, there’s often comfort in the breakaway. Westbrook and Harden average the second and third most points in transition per game. the 2nd and third most field goal attempts in transition per game, and can expect to be at the line 15.8% and 17.5% of the time. The reason being is fairly simple—floor spacing, early runs into transition and where the two guards are often finding themselves on defense. They’re cheating the system.

Off of the missed shot against Miami, [Harden gets the ball right awayl to start the break](https://youtu.be/O1MRai_Ivgs?t=398). Not on screen, Gary Clark has sprinted down the side of the court and is alone in the corner. Westbrook streaks to the wing and pulls-up, McLeMore changes speed as he breaks the top of the key gets into the paint, and Harden has options. Because of Miami’s failure to stop the ball and poor defensive footwork from Kendrick Nunn, Harden is able to drive and draw the foul.

Harden has needed the easy buckets and the defensive lapses. 

With a half-court offense that is built around the success of James Harden, it makes sense. If James Harden is struggling, the total offense struggles. His win-loss splits are incredible this season. When the Houston Rockets win, he is 48.7% from the field, **42.3%** from deep,  and a 13.3 +/-. In losses, 39.8% from the field, 28.3% from deep and a -9.5 +/- with only a -3.3% difference in usage. 

And a lot of people attack Russell Westbrook’s inability to pick-up the slack when Harden is struggling. However, we’re seeing the problems that come with a high usage player. Because you aren’t surrounding Harden with a ton of shooting depth—or what we used to see with LeBron in Cleveland, we witness a lot of dribbling. The Rockets average the 3rd most dribbles per touch in the league—2.61, which is pretty intriguing to think about because they have the second least touches per game—368.7. 

The thought behind bringing in Westbrook makes a lot of sense because of what worked with Chris Paul and Harden—two primary ball-handlers. The problem is that James Harden is still averaging a 8.8 time of possession, averages 6.12 seconds per touch and 5.84 dribbles per touch. The battle for ball control is one-sided and without that even split, *what are we supposed to expect from Russell?* You weren’t bringing on an off-ball threat. Westbrook’s style has always been reliant on his ability to drive to the basket, which means he has to have the ball in his hands. Its worked when in transition—he’s still excellent at finishing at the rim— but in the half court, its Harden time. So even when Harden isn’t performing his best, you’re still keeping the ball in his hands. And this has been disappointing because when Harden is off the court getting rest, Russell has been excellent leading the Houston Rockets and doing the things we expect of someone of his skill level. 

Then again, the D’Antoni system has never worked well with multiple people needing the ball. Its the fatal flaw. 

The fear for this iteration of the Houston Rockets is what happens when team’s figure Harden out. Because truthfully, he can be defended. In their Christmas day upset, Steve Kerr and the Golden State Warriors did an excellent job at stopping Harden’s dribble. Paul George, when guarding James in their two match-ups, was able to force him to pick up his dribble numerous times, leading to a poor shot attempt or a turnover. You still cannot play him tight—take notes Patrick Beverly—because Houston Rockets can run the high screen or Harden can simply draw contact every single time. And if you get into foul trouble against James Harden, you’re fucked. But solid defensive footwork and lateral movement can force a contested shot. The San Antonio Spurs would play disciplined defense in two of their match-ups this season but get burned later into the game. Again, the goal shouldn’t be to flat out stop him because it is impossible with the system in Houston. But if you can contain him, that’s a good start.

HardenBall is frustrating—for fans of the game, for teammates when its failing, for people like me that just want to remind people that Gilbert Arenas did it first. Its nerds going wild over the thought of letting your best player have the ball all of the time and thinking it will work. It was thinking like a video game—you don’t need offensive rhythm from a team, you don’t need to establish over aspects of said offense, it would simply just happen.

This piece was just meant to be  a friendly reminder that the Houston Rockets offense is meant for James Harden to be great. The constant usage of an isolation-based offense to give James Harden as much space as possible is the key to success for the Houston Rockets. It doesn’t mean its the right one and it doesn’t mean that it will work all the time. Right now, I’m just nitpicking greatness because while Houston is still towards the top of the west and James Harden continues to battle for a MVP award, it may not lead to a championship. 

PJ Tucker remains as the catch-and-shoot player needed for the team—shooting 67.2% on 0 dribbles but guys but the aforementioned wing guys prefer the dribble into their shots. What Harden has truly always needed was the Shaq to Kobe, the Pau to Kobe, the Yao to Tracy—the big man the Clint Capella isn’t physically built out to be. Because if the Houston Rockets develop the big man, the lack of shooting depth won't matter. Instead, it will open up the floor even more with a low post presence. 

The front office in Houston is testing the waters of relying on the back of one person. It hasn’t worked in the NBA for sometime and hasn’t brought a championship to a team for sometime. You can push blame wherever you want to but there is a lot to go around. The one man you can’t blame is the person that is trying his best—James Harden.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,74824,public,self,[OC] HardenBall: How the Video Game Numbers Come From a Video Game Mindset,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ekukx5/oc_hardenball_how_the_video_game_numbers_come/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not only is there the primary issue that you may be pressured to trade a guy that you would otherwise keep, but there is the secondary issue that the fear of a future trade demand may pressure the GM to make bad personnel moves. For example, if a GM has a 3 year plan but is afraid that a star player may demand a trade if they think that timeline is too slow, the GM could be pressured to make decisions that are a bad fit strategically in an attempt to appease the player. Obviously, these competing interests can result in bad team fit and misaligned organizational priorities.

So what do you do? For me, I think teams need to give up on the idea of trying to stop the trade demands and, instead, look to get something of comparable value back from the players during the next round of CBA negotiations.

I'm certainly interested in hearing what others thing, but the most obvious choice to me would be moving away from fully guaranteed contracts. The logic behind this idea goes like this:

Basically, an NBA contract is an agreement in which both sides (the player and the team) give something up in exchange for receiving some compensation. Theoretically, in the current set-up, the player receives a guaranteed contract (that's the benefit to them) and, in exchange, they sacrifice their ability to pick/influence what team they will play for (this control is what they give up). The reverse of that is true for the teams; they are forced to pay the player the full value of the contract (that's what the team gives up) in exchange for the player no longer having the ability to influence/choose where they play (that's the team's benefit).

Now, if the practical reality of the situation has moved away from this theoretic balance in a way that reduces what the player is giving up (and, in turn, reducing what the team is receiving in benefit), then the logical solution is to reduce the benefit the player receives to re-balance the exchange.

To me, the obvious way to do this is to reduce the guarantees the player receives on the salary. Any thoughts on this? Is it a logical idea in theory? Will the league be able to actually adopt this as a practical negotiating point? What is the biggest risk of unintended results if this idea was implemented? 

To give my opinion, I think that: (1) it is logical, (2) it would be practical from a negotiating point if the teams are willing to accept an extended lockout, and (3) the biggest risk is that it wouldn't really hurt the stars that are demanding the trades and would instead be used much more often on the tier of players below that elite level that weren't really the ones demanding trades in the first place.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,74823,public,self,Idea for the NBA to Address Player-Initiated Trade Demands During the Next Round of CBA Negotiations,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ekucad/idea_for_the_nba_to_address_playerinitiated_trade/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, there is no official rule stating that your center must be of a certain height, but it is an unwritten rule that you can't have a 5'11 guy be your main rim protector. 

So, I'm wondering what are the ""metagame"" or competitive unwritten rules of the modern NBA? 

I was thinking about this because during the preseason, so many people said Westbrook/Harden wouldn't work because the unwritten rule that you can't have two players as ball-dominant as these two in the same lineup.

Another commentary that had me thinking was the evolution of centers. The thought now seems to be a team cannot be a title challenger if its best player is an old-school style center that doesn't provide spacing. Is this true? If you drop Prime Shaq in a decent but non-title-challenger like a Brooklyn Net or a Pheonix Suns, what would be his effect?

The last unwritten rule I heard was that no guard can ever be truly elite in the modern NBA unless he is at least ""good"" at 3-point shooting.

As a Blazers fan, the thought of trading CJ McCollum and Hassan Whiteside for Horford and Kevin Love definitely seemed like a bad move. CJ is one of the more underrated players in the league and the frontcourt would be very crowded with 2+ year deals of Love, Horford, Nurkic and Zach Collins, meaning we would have to trade one of them anyways. I decided to try a different trade, this one less focused on the Trail Blazers.

Each of these teams has a somewhat-specific need. The 76ers goal is to become a true contender, the Trail Blazers are aiming for the playoffs this year and to potentially contend, but with an eye more on the next few years, the Thunder are probably hoping to start their climb back to contention next year or later (but are planning on making the playoffs this year as a 6-8 seed) and the Cavaliers are planning for the more distant future. To complete their goals each of these teams has a requirement:

* The Trail Blazers frontcourt depth is one of the worst in the league with injuries of Nurkic, Hood, and Zach Collins. These guys are all set to be ready to play next season, with Nurkic being the only one probable to return this season before the playoffs. The most lacking positions currently are the forwards. Carmelo is good enough to start but he can only cover one of these positions, and is usually playing Power Forward this year. To go along with the rest of the roster, the Blazers need an above-average Power Forward and then move Carmelo to the 3. 
* The 76ers need a different Point Guard to contend. Ben Simmons is a decent playmaker but doesn't fit well next to Joel Embiid. The team is way too big, and has no 3-point shooting. 
* The Thunder, if looking to start contending again in a season or two, need to get rid of the massive Chris Paul contract before it's too late and let Shai Gilgeous-Alexander be the offensive leader. This would be after a season of Chris Paul mentoring SGA. They may want to collect some expiring contracts for the offseason...
* The Cavaliers need a Point Guard who can pass. Right now, they have a distinctively different PG problem than Philadelphia. The Cavs are relying too much on ISO perimeter play by their ""point guards"" Collin Sexton and Darius Garland, neither of which seem to be true point guards. They need a passing point guard, and would probably be wise to get rid of the contract of Kevin Love now, when his stock is worth more.

So, those are the problems that I have laid out for each team. Here is my trade proposal:                                                                If you'd like to see it on the trade simulator, here's the link: [http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=ydox2t9x](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=ydox2t9x)

* The Trail Blazers receive Kevin Love and Tristan Thompson from Cleveland
* The 76ers receive Chris Paul and Nerlens Noel from Oklahoma City, and Darius Garland from Cleveland
* The Thunder receive Hassan Whiteside and Kent Bazemore from Portland
* The Cavaliers receive Al Horford and Ben Simmons from Philadelphia

I know, it seems strange that all of these teams receive packages of two guys from the same team, but it makes more sense to lay this out as a 4-team trade, since no team is actually getting one player from a team and sending one of their own to that team too.

What does this solve?

* The Trail Blazers have Kevin Love. They have a power forward who can shoot from anywhere, grab rebounds and has championship experience. This allows Carmelo to play his natural small forward, and this creates a very strong scoring team. The Blazers downgrade from Hassan Whiteside to Tristan Thompson for the rest of this season, but assuming that Thompson will not have much offensive load, it may not be felt badly. Jusuf Nurkic is projected to return around the all-star break, and a center rotation of Nurkic and Thompson is strong. Thompson is a free agent in the offseason, and Nurkic is solidified as the long-term center for the team. A starting lineup of Dame-CJ-Melo-Love-Nurkic is an upgrade over the current team and could wreak havoc come playoff time. 
* The 76ers get the Point God. Does anyone else remember Chris Paul on the Clippers? There will be a ton of lobs, and Chris Paul will bring experience to the Sixers. It will be a combination similar to LeBron and Anthony Davis, an older point guard and a younger big man. While the better duo is easily the LA pair, the Sixers have more around them on their starting lineup with Tobias Harris and Josh Richardson. This team could climb the standings and  have a shot at the finals. Chris Paul is no doubt an upgrade over Ben Simmons for this team, however losing Horford could possibly be a struggle, however they also receive Nerlens Noel to bring depth to the big man position. The Sixers could realistically also grab Darius Garland from the Cavs if they wanted to, or a few picks. Garland would be a potential asset for the future, though.
* While the Thunder don't necessarily fall from playoff contention, they definitely worsen a bit in the short-term. Whiteside will crowd the Center position with Steven Adams, but Adams could potentially play Power Forward for the remainder of the season. Kent Bazemore would bring some defense. And both of these new players are on expiring contracts, meaning that the Thunder will have roughly 40 million dollars in cap space for the offseason. Moving Chris Paul allows Shai Gilgeous-Alexander to become the primary ball handler for the team. These moves would set the Thunder up mightily for the future. They could even probably get some draft picks in this deal, adding to their stockpile, and would have tons of cap space.
* The Cavaliers get Ben Simmons and Al Horford. Simmons would play Point Guard, moving Collin Sexton to Shooting Guard, which would fit much better. Horford would replace either Love at Power Forward or Thompson at Center. This deal doesn't make the Cavs anything more than playoff contenders, but it is an upgrade over the current mess.

Does anyone know where I can get compiled injury stats/quarter?

My hypthoesis: 
A player's injury risk is at it's highest. In the first few minutes on the court and still getting acclimated to the physicality of the game. Some teams play more physical defense than others.

But starters are less likely to get injured. Due to survivor bias. Rookies who are injury prone are less likely to developed into a starter.

Thus, injuries are highest around the start of 1st/2nd rotation of bench players coming in. So late Q1 to late Q2.

What are your thoughts on this rumour? Who do you see as potential trade targets for the Lakers? In your opinion, how would a potential trade look like?

I would not be surprised if Kuzma was packaged along with other players like Quinn Cook, Rajon Rondo etc. to match the salaries. Maybe even Avery Bradley or Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (though KCP was great for them, from what I watched).

One trade destination that I haven't seen discussed as much as the others and I feel like that is slept on - Detroit Pistons for Derrick Rose. If the rumours of Pistons looking to trade Andre Drummond are true (which I assume they are), the Pistons would be looking to rebuild the team, and acquiring Kyle Kuzma as a solid piece would be a nice addition to such a team.

So as a break from the constant chatter about the Lakers, Rockets, Clippers, Luka, Raptors, Celtics and Sixers: here's a brief report on the 23 other teams that /r/nba tends to ignore. I’ve gone into every team subreddit in search of three things that might seem interesting/surprising to a non-fan.

This is mainly a surface level reading of what's going on though, so I hope that other fans will come in and correct me if I'm super offbase or elaborate on the things that I've chosen to summarise.

*Bucks and Jazz fans protested about being ignored in the last thread so I’m experimenting with being over-inclusive this month.

--------------------------------------------------

#THE EASTERN CONFERENCE

**Magic**

- Current record: 16-20 and 8th in the Eastern Conference.

- Orlando Magic are 6-9 in their last 15 games with Vucevic putting up 20/10 with 2 stocks. Their fans REALLY enjoyed the wins against the Heat and the Sixers. As of today, they are 2 games ahead of 9th placed Charlotte and seem well-placed to make the playoffs again this season. 

- Except injury woes have struck with their entire wing rotation currently being out. The worst, of course, being Johnathan Isaac who was making a push for All-Defence being injured for two months. Gordon, Okeke and Aminu just make it worse for Magic fans.

- For those curious about Mo Bamba: “He’s raw af, decent shot blocker, better than expected 3pt shooter. He’s probably 3 years away from starting for this team. He shows the signs — but like many young players, he’s yet to do it consistently. He’s improved compared to where he was from the start of the season though.”

**Pacers**

- Current record: 22-14 and 6th in the Eastern Conference.

- Pacers have beaten Philly, Lakers, Celtics, Toronto and Jazz this season and could finish with a home seed this season. Why are they so good? “imagine having to face a 7 footer who bullies the fuck out of people in the paint and is top 5 in the league in rebounds, while also having to face a 7 footer who shoots the 3 at 38% and averages over 2.0 blocks a game. not to mention the former ROY and MIP in the same starting lineup with one of the most underrated scorers in the league (TJ Warren).”

- Recent WojBomb:’ Pacers All-Star Victor Oladipo hopeful for a late January/early February return from ruptured quad tendon’

- There is a growing worry that Indiana won’t have any All-Star representation in the upcoming All-Star game. Sabonis is behind Hayward, Blake and Vince in fan voting while Brogdon didn’t even make the top 10. Tacko Fall has double the votes of Sabonis and /r/pacers is willing to riot if he ends up a starter.

**Hornets:**

- Current record: 15-23 and 8th in the Eastern Conference.

- Terry Rozier is 1 year older than Kendrick Nunn, producing the same numbers as Fred Vanvleet and Jamal Murray on the same pay as Jeff Teague and Reggie Jackson. /r/hornets is dividing on Scary Terry with some saying that he is empty stats and others saying that he is better than expected.

- PJ Washington has returned from injury and has continued his nice form. In his last 5 games, he is averaging 15.6 points, 5.2 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 9 of 17 from 3-point range in that time. Some believe he’s been a top 5 rookie this year.

- /r/hornets has been discussing realistic trade targets. While most seem to want 1st round picks to help shore up their young squad, others mentioned names like Poetl, Dunn and Beasley as guys who fit in with what they’re trying to do.

**Pistons:**

- Current record: 13-23 and 11th in the Eastern Conference.

- While are sad about Drummond leaving, most are excited about the idea of a full rebuild where they’ll finally be moving in the right direction. Hawks are the frontrunners but new reports say that Portland and Charlotte might be interested. If any decent offers come in for Blake and Rose, fans seem comfortable with losing them too.

- Did you know Detroit had a young core? Me neither. Their names are Sekou Doumbouya, Bruce Brown, Christian Wood, Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk and Luke Kennard. Most will already know Kennard but Sekou is a 19yo rookie who’s started to see serious minutes. He has a double double in his last two games and /r/DetroitPistons are getting excited.

- The Lions, Tigers and Red Wings are still all below .500 too so life is still pretty rough right now for Detroits sports fans.

**Cavs:**

- Current record: 10-25 and 13th in the Eastern Conference.

- Kevin Love is throwing major tantrums right now but what does Cleveland fans think? Reactions are mixed but my favourite comment is this one: “120 mil for getting carried by LeBron, and he still not happy”. This story is already in the limelight so not much to add here.

- 2nd year Collin Sexton is currently in the firing line. Hes upped his PPG, RPG, FG% all while playing less minutes than last year so far. But he needs to get back to shooting 3s efficiently because hes had a major decline from behind the arc. He was at 40% from 3 last year but has only made 27% of his 3s this year. Some find his tunnel vision infuriating while others argue that he’s a scapegoat for a weak roster and terrible FO. For those who are curious, Sexton putting up 18/2 on a rookie contract. To compare, Jamal Murray is putting up 18/5 on $33m a year.

- Cavs have 14 games left in January with only 4 of them being .500 teams. Considering 90% of their wins have come against other teams with a losing record, don’t be surprised if the Cavs go on a winning streak sometime soon.

**Bucks:**

- Current record: 32-5 and 1st in the Eastern Conference.

- Acting like the team with the best record in the NBA and the reigning MVP is ignored is silly so I’ll just highlight some non-Giannis content to appease the Bucks fans. Here’s [a pic from Eric Bledsoe’s birthday party](https://i.imgur.com/A5Yl8DQ.jpg). 

- Everyone knows Giannis dominates inside the paint but [Middleton has everywhere else absolutely covered](https://i.imgur.com/Pdno20h.jpg)

- Bucks have the best record and that’s not going to change this month. The only .500 teams they face this month are Boston and Denver but the big event for Milwaukee is their game against the Hornets in Paris. Due to the travel probably. This will be their only game between the 20th and the 28th of the month.

**Nets:**

- Current record: 16-18 and 7th in the Eastern Conference.

- Yes, Kyrie and  is injured but quick summary of the rest of the squad. Levert has just returned from injury and played 15 minutes yesterday. David Nwaba is loved and missed.. Taurean Prince is ass. Theo Pinson is ass. Kenny Atkinson may or may not be ass.

- The Nets All-Decade team is Dinwiddie/D-Lo/Johnson/Thad Young/Brook which I found interesting. How well do you reckon that team would do in today’s Eastern Conference? Maybe they get a first-round upset.

- The Nets have the biggest active losing streak in the NBA. They’ve lost their last 5 with three of them coming against Houston, Toronto and Dallas, one being an OT loss to Minnesota and a loss to local rival, the Knicks. The schedule for the rest of the month is pretty tough with games coming up against Utah, Miami, 2x Philly, Milwaukee, and Lakers. If they slip up against any of the teams below .500, don’t be surprised if they drop out of the playoff spots.

**Bulls:**

- Current record: 13-23 and 10th in the Eastern Conference.

- The average age of Chicago’s 8 man rotation yesterday was 23.75 years old. “ Kris Dunn, Thad Young and Satoransky are just stop gap players. The real core is Coby, Lavine, Markkannen, WCJ and Gafford”. Also, Daniel Gafford may prove to be the steal of the 2019 draft as he leads his draft class with 1.22 blocks per game while only averaging 11 minutes.

- After a poor start to the season, Markkannen’s form is finally picking up. In December, Lauri Markkannen averaged 17.6/6.1/1.4 in 65% TS. Some are frustrated that he only gets 12 shots a game while others believe that his terrible chemistry with Lavine is why he hasn’t taken a leap yet. Still, there’s little reason to lose faith and he seems due for a couple big performances.

- The Bulls have the 4th best defence in the NBA. To quote their sub, “We're 14th in the NBA in netrtg at -0.4.This means that we have the best netrtg of any team below .500. And simultaneously have a better netrtg than both the 7th and the 8th seed in the East. We’re the best shit team in the NBA.”


**Wizards:**

- Current record: 11-24 and 12th in the Eastern Conference.

- There doesn’t seem to be a lot going on in the Wizards sub. Bertans good. Rui injured. Beal beal. Everyone seems to accept that they’re redshirting right now but are ‘ happy with the direction for next year of Wall/Beal/Troy/Rui/Thomas Bryant + our lottery pick + Bertans/Ish/Admiral/Wagner/McRae bench’.

- [John Wall is practicing full contact 1v1 and is nearing a return soon.](https://streamable.com/c8m3d)

- Can’t find any other interesting things on the subreddit so let me just remind everyone that Bertans is shooting 43% on 8.6 3s a game.

**Knicks:**

- Current record: 10-25 and 14th in the Eastern Conference.

- “Mike Miller is 6-6 in his first 12 games as Knicks head coach, David Fizdale was there for 104 games and he never had a 12 game stretch as good”. After 12 games, it seems like all the things that Knicks fans thought was dumb about Fizdale was actually dumb. Using Randle and Portis as ball handlers, trying to make Kevin Knox a 2, throwing out random DNPs for no reason. Miller’s sorted all of that out and the Knicks record has improved.

- The mood is improving on /r/nyknicks. Their vets like Morris/Randle/Elfrid are being utilized properly, their young core of RJ/Frank/Knox/Mitch seem to be in good hands and their offseason targets of Zion, Kyrie and KD were a lot riskier than they first anticipated.

- Knicks next 11 games are fucking tough. In order, Clippers, Lakers, Jazz, resurgent Pelicans, Heat, Bucks, healthy Suns, Philadelphia, Cavs, Lakers, Raptors. If the Knicks can go through this stretch without being blown out by 30 once, then it’ll be a huge impovement.

**Hawks:**

- Current record: 8-28 and 15th in the Eastern Conference.

- All season, Hawks fans have been shouting about their team desperately needs a backup ballhandler because their offence straight-up dies when Trae is off the floor. Enter 2nd year Brandon Goodwin. In the last 3 games, Goodwin has averaged 12/3/3 in 76% TS. And the Hawks record in those games? Ws over the Pacers and the Magic and a last second L to the Celtics. 7 of the Hawks next 13 games are against .500 teams, so don’t expect them to be a run together just yet.

- Advanced stats no longer say that Trae Young is the worst defender in the NBA. That title now belongs to Bradley Beal who now lies at the bottom of DRPM and DRAPTOR. In fact, DRAPTOR has Trae currently as a better defender than Fox, Kennard, D’Lo, Booker, Derozan and IT as well. Please update your circlejerks accordingly.

- Quick summary of everything else. John Collins is back. Huerter is hitting good form. Hunter looks promising. Jury’s still out on Reddish. Reaction is mixed on Drummond.

------------------------------------------------------

#THE WESTERN CONFERENCE

**Thunder**

- Current record: 20-15 and 7th in the Western Conference.

- People are generally aware of how well CP3 is doing on the court, but what he’s doing off the court is going under the radar. Just from glancing at the sub, he’s bought the entire roster custom suits, is gifting floor tickets to random families, being a clear mentor for SGA and is paying for the team to go watch NFL games. Naturally, /r/okc loves this fucking guy.

- A month ago, 6 of OKC’s 8 wins come against Golden State and the Pelicans and people weren’t sure about how good they are. Now they are 9-1 in their last 10 games with notable wins over Toronto, Dallas and the Clippers. They are 2 games behind Luka and have a month where more than half of their games are against teams lower than .500. It’s not ridiculous to think that this team could finish in the top 6. 

- Though, naturally that’s only going to happen if they keep CP3, Adams, Schroder and Gallinari around. General feeling from OKC fans is that they want to ride this fun season out, make the playoffs and then accumulate more picks in the summer. Also, everyone (including me) would love to see a Rockets/OKC first round series.

**Nuggets**

- Current record: 24-11 and 2nd in the Western Conference.

- After a 3 game losing streak that culminated in a disappointing loss to Philadelphia, Denver Nuggets then went on a 10-3 streak where they racked up Ws over Lakers and Pacers. In that run, Jokic finally hit form and averaged 22/9/7,  Michael Porter Jr started his first ever game and got 25pts in 23 minutes and Gary Harris continued his All-Defence campaign.

- It’s only a minority but some people are growing concerned that Jamal Murray hasn’t taken a leap. He’s signed a max extension and his numbers have gome from 17/4 in his sophomore year to 18/5 on average efficiency in 2020. The Nuggets are still winning with him and he’s shown to be a good fit with Jokic but some fans believe their team’s ceiling is capped unless Murray becomes a biggger contributor.

- There’s a lot of Jokic content on their subreddit so here are some stray Jokic facts: Jokic is tied with Bob Cousy for 10th most triple doubles ever, he’s passed Melo to become 9th in Denver assists and BR ranked him the 35th best player of the 2010s.

**Grizzlies**

- Current record: 14-22 and 11th in the Western Conference.

- We are approaching the All-Star Break and the Grizzlies are 1 game away from the 8th seed. Do they trade Valanciunas to try and secure a lottery pick? Or do they skip this draft and aim to become the youngest playoff team in history? It’s a good problem to have and fans seem fine with either option.

- RECYCLE: They’re a contender for the most promising young core in the league. Ja, JJJ, Clarke, Anderson, Caboclo, Brooks are all 24 and under, with 27 year-old JV serving as the elder statesman. Apart from JJJ’s inability to stay out of foul trouble, there are no serious concerns.

- RECYCLE: Fans don’t seem confident about nabbing anyone in free agency or via trades. Their 2020 pick is top-6 protected and the top priority seems to be a wing that will complement Ja and JJJ.

**Jazz**

- Current record: 23-12 and 5th in the Western Conference.

- Clippers, Mavericks and the Nuggets all lose and now Utah Jazz are one game away from being the 2nd seed in the West. After a torrid run, where they went 6-2 in December, Jazz have gone 10-1 in their last 11 games with their only .500 win in that stretch coming over the Clippers. Their next 7 games are all against teams below .500 so expect this run to continue.

- Coincidentally Mike Conley has missed 13 of their last 14 games via injury. Mitchell has stepped in as PG and he looks good. Mitchell is putting up 27/6 in the Jazz’s last 5 games and the Jazz have 5 Ws. Though their schedule recently has been soft, would they have won all those games with Conley too? /r/UtahJazz thinks they definitely would have and aren’t willing to entertain discussion of trading Conley yet. 

- So far, fans are loving the Clarkson/Exum trade and they’re seeing the bench improvement already. Georges Niang is starting to get buckets. Joe Ingles has been balling out. Gobert might threepeat the DPOY. Jazz fans are having a good time right now.

**Trailblazers**

- Current record: 15-21 and 8th in the Western Conference.

- /r/trailblazers is ANNOYED that people don’t understand just how injured they are. “Portland are missing 3 starters, two of which were key defensive pieces in Collins and Nurkic, Hood who was an extremely efficient scoring option that could create his own shot, as well as now the backup center in Skal who gave valuable minutes when Hassan sat.”

- Even though they’re 8th, there’s no passion for a playoff push due to their current injuries. Nurkic and Collins aren’t expected back so several fans would rather miss out entirely than be 1st round fodder for the Lakers.

- Their sub has a massive trade thread. Summary, Love is bad because of huge contract and injury prone.Love is good because he’s a good fit and a hometown guy. Some say they shouldn’t trade but instead should get healthy and reassess. Aaron Gordon’s name also came up multiple times.

**Spurs**

- Current record: 14-20 and 9th in the Western Conference.

- Spurs were the 8th seed 5 days ago and the hunger to keep up their playoffs streak is real. Ideal scenario is a first round war against the Clippers. In terms of prospect, the subreddit is kinda low on Dejounte Murray and very high on Lonnie Walker IV. They’re desperate for him to get more minutes and think they’ve got someone potentially special on their hands. Also, it might be time for Derrick White to return to the starting five.

- In his last 7 games, Derozan is averaging 25.7pts on a nice 69% TS. Contract talks are happening soon and /r/nbaspurs are open to resigning him as long as it’s nowhere near the max. Also, there doesn’t seem to be much interesting in trading Aldridge either. They’d like to trade Forbes and Belinelli too but feel like their stock is currently low so they won’t get any value in return.

- On the Spurs’ recent decline, someone commented “I think we greatly underestimated how much losing FO people &amp; our assistants over the years would hurt us &amp; I think it's starting to take it's toll. Guys like Bud definitely had a great impact on our offense &amp; losing guys like Sean Marks has hurt our FO cause they're definitely not the same either.

**Suns**

- Current record: 14-21 and 10th in the Western Conference.

- Deandre Ayton’s favourite player is Kevin Garnett and what has Monty Williams decided to do? Play Ayton at the 4. Sort of. To put it simply, on offense Baynes is 4, Ayton 5 but on defense they switch. The lineup reportedly looked good against the Knicks but fans’ only issue is who’s gonna be the bigman in the second unit. Hopefully Check Diallo can hold it down until Kaminsky comes back from injury.

-  2nd year Mikal Bridges is a minor unsung hero of Phoenix. ‘He has the highest net ratg of any player on their team and has legit All-Defence potential and will probably be underpaid for the entirety of his career due to lack of splashiness’. Fans think he doesn’t play enough minutes but he seems like a big part of the Sun’s future.  

- After an 8-game losing streak, the Suns are now 3-1 in their last four with 2 wins coming against 8th seed rivals, Sacramento and Portland. In that run, Ayton has played great defence, Oubre Jr is averaging 26/8/3 and Booker is averaging 33/8/4. 6 of their next opponents are below .500 so we’ll start to have a sense of how good this Suns team really is.

**Timberwolves**

- Current record: 13-21 and 12th in the Western Conference.

- “The #Twolves are not moving KAT anytime soon. Stories like this create discussion, and selfishly, are good for business, whether for radio or TV. But just know that Wolves folks would tell you that KAT more than anything wants to win here. Year 1 of 5 offers time.” Trading for D’Lo discussions have started up again but having 3 max contracts of D’Lo, Wiggins and Towns isn’t going to scare anyone in the playoffs, so it seems like they’d have to get rid of Wiggins somehow too. 

- It seems that the Embiid beef, trade rumours and being a 7 foot Steph Curry has done wonders for his popularity this season. From being behind an injured Boogie in All-Star voting last year, Towns is now 5th behind Lebron, AD, Kawhi and PG despite his team’s losing record.

- After an 11 game losing streak, The Timberwolves find themselves 1 game out from the 8th seed. They are 3-2 in their last 5 with  goddamn, it’s close at the bottom of the West! - with them on a current 3-2 with 8 of their next 13 games coming against .500 teams. Do Timberwolves fans dare to believe they can make the 8th seed? No. Most of them have no faith at all.

**Kings**

- Current record: 12-24 and 13th in the Western Conference.

- Of all the teams battling for the 8th seed, the Kings subreddit is the angriest. They’ve soured on Buddy Hield, they’re shitting on their FO, they’re pining for Boogie, Shump and Joerger, they want Luke fired now. It is bad. And they’re only two games out from the 8th seed! 

- But why are Kings fans so angry? Because they’re 1-9 in their last 10 and fans believe they could be pushing for the 4th/5th seed if certain things were different. 4 of those losses came against Pacers, Rockets, Nuggets, Clippers while another 4 losses came against 8th seed rivals, Grizzlies, Suns, Timberwolves, Pelicans. Of their next 12, 6 are against .500 teams and another two are huge games against Suns and Timberwolves. January is a huge month for them.

- Who does Kings trade for to get better? No-one. Common sentiment seems to be ‘Just hold steady and get a good draft pick and hope the young guys start developing.” 

**Pelicans**

- Current record: 12-24 and 14th in the Western Conference.

- The New Orleans Pelicans can still make the playoffs. “An amazing 14 of their final 15 games are against teams with losing records, nine of them are at home, and the one winning team (Philadelphia, which visits April 11) may end up sitting players to rest for the playoffs. For those of you tracking such things this early, the Pels will also own the tie-break with Portland if they win either of the teams’ final two meetings.” They have currently won 6 of their last 8 games. Derrick Favors has returned and is balling out. The fans (and the media) would love a first round series against the Lakers.

- What about Zion? Isn’t he redshirting? Not according to /r/NOLApelicans. That’s a dumb narrative people are selling to get clicks. Reports say that the team is just being extra conservative with their #1 pick and they expect him to debut this year. General sentiment is that “If he’s injury prone, then he’s injury prone. Sitting healthy players does not benefit the player. Zion will only get better at basketball if he plays. He will only get in true NBA basketball shape, if he plays basketball. Sitting an extra 30 games this season isn’t going to extend his longevity.”

- Lonzo ‘is a bust’ Ball is averaging 25/8 in his last three games on 65% TS. What do Pelicans’ fans attribute such a crazy turnaround to? The introduction of Favors helps but also, “Lonzo has been saying that he feels healthier than ever, and these last few games his bounce has been WAY more noticeable as he's been dunking it more often - he had an insane tip dunk in the blazers game. So the reason for his lack of aggressiveness issues might have been also related to health - he's looked way more athletic these past few games. His 3 has been falling much more, he has been driving more - more aggressive overall and PATIENT - he's also looked more athletic, that in summary makes the current lonzo current.”",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,74758,public,self,The Small-Market Spotlight for January 2020 - shining a light on the more ignored teams in the NBA,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ekiakn/the_smallmarket_spotlight_for_january_2020/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

76ers 1996-2007 average 3PA per-game: 25th

76ers 1996-2007 average 3PT%: 24th

Iverson, simply put, had no sort of spacing or shooting threats to open up the floor or take away the defense's focus, forcing him to take low percentage shots. 

Coupled with the fact that he was an undersized SG, it would make it extremely hard to find good, efficient shots. 

**No consistent 2nd-offensive option**

Coleman: 13.9 PPG &amp; 8.4 REB (6 seasons)

Iguodala: 10.7 PPG &amp; 5.7 REB (2 seasons)

McKie: 7.7 PPG &amp; 3.0 AST (8 seasons)

Stackhouse: 19.5 PPG &amp; 3.4 AST (3 seasons) 

76ers tenure: 27.6 PPG on 42/31/78 shooting. 

Advanced shooting: |23 FGA|45 eFG%|51 TS%|

Nuggets tenure: 25.6 PPG on 46/34/78 shooting.

Advanced shooting: |19 FGA|49 eFG%|56 TS%| 

The 76ers had no legitimate 2nd scorer apart from Jerry Stackhouse for 3 seasons. So it'd be easier to just guide the defense's focus all at Iverson, as they had no 3-point shooting threat, no consistent shot creator, and no low post scorer.  

Furthermore explaining why Iverson had low shooting percentages, because he was shouldering almost all scoring responsibility.

And we all know the Nuggets were a bad fit for Iverson, but as you can see, every single one of his shooting percentages all went up when he finally had a solid offensive team. 

**Era**

And the simplest answer to Iverson's efficiencies were his era. His peak as a player was from about 1998 to 2006, which is the arguably the best defensive era in NBA history. 

Even elite big men such as Duncan and Garnett had low eFG% and TS%. In that era, efficiency and high percentage shots weren't preached. It was simply about getting a bucket.

From that 8 year span of 1998-2006, 7 of those seasons the pace are in in the bottom-10 for lowest pace in NBA history. The game was slow, tough, and wildly inefficient. 

When the game leaned from defense to offense around 2005 or so, everyone's shooting climbed up as well.

Right now the general mood is pretty positive. We seemingly got over last season's nightmare, the jays are showing progress again, hayward is finally producing and kemba has been a great fit both on and off the court. But what is this team's ceiling? What are the prospects of becoming championship contenders?

I think everything hinges on tatum's development. Jaylen Brown improvements are nice, but it looks like he is fitting into a khris middleton/luol deng mold, probably the third best player on a championship team, assuming he keeps rounding out his game. Kemba is great, but he's no curry, lebron or giannis. He's also almost 30.

So that leaves us with tatum. He has upped his scoring output, and his handles and general feel for the game seem to be getting better also. But i'm not seeing the killer instinct. The unstopabble force. Granted, he's only 21, but we are banking on him becoming a superstar which i'm not really feeling.

So what we have is an all star level player who's probably not getting any better in the future, and two more or less borderline all stars, who will probably keep improving but who knows how much. Plus smart, whom I love but is a role player and some young pieces, of which exactly none are looking like studs.

&amp;#x200B;

So all in all, I don't see a road ahead for the celtics to become championship contenders. We also have cashed out on pretty much all of the assets we had accumulated, so unless some of the less heralded youngsters turn out to be great, we won't have the pieces to trade for a disgruntled star like we did in the past.

&amp;#x200B;

A long, long time ago where the Milwaukee Bucks were still being coached by Jason Kidd and having there FO managed by John Hammond, Kyrie Irving requested a trade. 

During that time the bucks offered the Cavs basically anyone besides Giannis for Kyrie.

That included...

Khris Middleton a consistent 3 level scorer, who could create his own shot all while playing good defence and was on a bargain of a contract, a player you’d think would fit perfect next to Lebron.

Malcom Brogdon, coming off a ROTY after establishing himself as one of the younger veterans in the NBA, who also had a very nice 3 point shot, shot creating ability and incredible poise to his game all while playing good defence. Who was also still on his rookie contract. 

Thon Maker who recently broke out in the first round 6 game series against the raptors and at this point in time his trade value was at an all time high. 

Jabari Parker, who had tore his ACL and was in rehab but before was looking like an all star that was averaging 20 ppg. 

[Q1] My question why wouldn’t the Cavs have inquired with Milwaukee more about the pieces they were offering and if not why didn’t they take Milwaukee’s offer over the Celtics?

[Q2] How insane would a team or Kyrie Irving and Giannis have been? 

[Q3] How good would the Cavs have been that season &amp;amp; how nice would Khris and Malcolm have looked playing next to lebron with the improvements they continued to make? 

Malcom Brogdon eventually became a 50/40/90 guy with the bucks and Khris Middleton became 20 ppg all star.

There’s so many different factors that could get in the way and no clear single way that it has been suggested to be implemented. 

Instead of forcing the idea of a mid season tournament, the NBA should just implement a 1-on-1 tournament at All Star Weekend. It would be similar to the 3pt contest/dunk contest where instead of having a representative from each team, the league decides on 16 players to compete in the tournament. Players would have the option to decline, obviously. The structure would be simple, just a 4 round bracket to determine the winner. There would be different classes (Guard/Wing/Big) so we wouldn’t have to see a center on a guard or something of that variety. 

There is really no reason why the league shouldn’t do it. The only “issue” is that the very best superstars wouldn’t participate with the risk of humiliation from losing, but even the dunk contest faces that issue. But even if Harden/Kawhi/etc don’t participate, a 1v1 tourney with lower tier stars would still be insane to watch. Imagine a bracket with guys like Lou Will, Trae Young, etc. And i’m sure certain superstars would love the opportunity and embrace it. Imagine if we got to watch Embiid and KAT go at it 1 on 1.

Notably, this quote from Kobe - 

&gt; “You know what, everybody has this conversation about who’s the best. The question to ask is does it matter? No. What matters is what? Winning championships. That’s the only thing that matters. You can sit here and debate until you’re blue in the face about who is the best. What you cannot debate is who is the champion at the end of the year. Period. Bill Russell is the greatest.”

I realize this isn't a super common opinion, but it's common enough that I feel it needs to be addressed.

Yes 11 championships is very impressive, I'm not denying that. But, I believe that MJ's 6 championships in a more competitive league, with more than twice as many teams, is a more impressive feat, statistically. Let's look at the numbers.

 

**Bill Russel Championships**

1957| 8
1959| 8
1960| 8

If we assign a points value to each championship based on the number of teams in the league at the time, we have

    Bill Russel = 8 + 8 + ... + 12 + 14       = 103 champ points

    Michael Jordan = 27 + 27 + ... + 29 + 29  = 168 champ points

Furthermore, I often see people downplay the 72-win season because of wins over expansion teams. Well, 2/29 teams being expansion teams is significantly less than 1/9, 3/12, or even 1/14, which Russell had. 

One could also argue that more teams in MJ's time means that the talent pool is more diluted. However, I think this is more than offset due to the fact that basketball was much more popular in the 90's than in the 60's when it was still a relatively new sport. Hell, in the 60s, a good basketball player might not even choose to play in the NBA since they could make more money with a regular job! The average NBA salary at the end of the 1960s was around $35,000, whereas at the beginning of the 90s is was closer to $1,000,000. And I won't even get into the fact that modern players are typically much more devoted to their craft, because, while I believe this is obvious, it is a more nuanced discussion that could probably occupy it's own thread.

To summarize, I believe that 6 championships in Jordan's era is much more impressive than 11 championships throughout the 1960s, due to the drastically increased competition.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,74612,public,self,"Michael Jordan's 6 Championships are more impressive than Bill Russell's 11 Championships, based on the number of teams in the league at the time.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ejksqq/michael_jordans_6_championships_are_more/,,,,,,,,099e778a-8b9a-11e8-b53d-0eebf66bed8a,Player Discussion,,,,

Hear me out: 

Giannis is a force, he's definitely a hell of a player. I just can't seem to shake a few things about his game that make it seem like the general public and sports outlets like Sportscenter are overrating him. 

First thing is that his offense is extremely underwhelming. Last year he shot 17(!!!) percent from outside of the restricted area. That is absolutely absurd. He's averaging over 10 FTA/G the past two years and is shooting an abysmal 59.9% from the stripe this year. Also, he and Harden have a very similar gravity towards traveling often and also getting to the free throw line. Why does no one talk about the fact that he takes 3 steps damn near every time he drives?? 2018 Percentage of points from the free throw line: Giannis=24.9% harden =26.8%. Supplemental to his FT%, his overall shooting is really not improving. Refer back to the game against the Lakers in which he made 5 (career high) 3-pointers while AD was waiting at the free throw line leaving him open. That was immediately followed by Embiid waiting in the same spot AD did, letting him shoot, and he went 0-7. His general stats look great but they are very perfectly suited for on-screen graphics in which the whole story isn't told. I also do not think getting blocked from the rim and throwing a desperation kick assist make passing an attribute to your game.

Secondly, people are flaunting his defensive ability. However, as the primary defender he gets beat off the dribble far more often than not. He averages 1 block and 1 steal per game this year (1.5 BLK and 1.3 STL 2018). When matched with someone close to his size, he struggles severely. Now I get that can also be said about Kevin Durant's 7'0 SF size relative to his defensive prowess, but at least Durant guards the ball more often than Giannis. Blocking shots look great on highlight tapes but if you're not the primary defender and blocking a guy from behind, it really isn't doing it for me rating your defensive ability. Similar to Westbrook, I do not applaud uncontested rebounds. For reference- Russ=75% uncontested rebounds, Giannis=71% uncontested.

Thirdly I would like to point out that he is profiting from a system in which Budenholzer formed an unreal starting lineup and is effectively the best offensive coach in the league. Yet, Giannis gets all of the credit to the public while Bud's staff is getting swiped up behind closed doors without much media representation. Similar to McVay in the NFL the entire league is going after the Budenholzer coaching tree. No one talks about Middleton, no one talks about Brook lopez being one of the best centers in the league, or Bledsoe being arguably the best defending point guard in the east. 6 of the 8 best +/- (i know, ""dumb stat"") in the league are Milwaukee Bucks, speaking volumes about the talent surrounding Giannis. It seems as though instead of the superstar making their teammates better, the opposite is happening in Milwaukee.

I get that he is a very likeable guy, but I need some solid rebuttal to be convinced that he is not overrated. I truly do not believe that he is a top 5 player in the nba (lebron, KD, kawhi,  AD, harden).",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,74613,public,self,Is Giannis overrated?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ejjgns/is_giannis_overrated/,,,,,,,,099e778a-8b9a-11e8-b53d-0eebf66bed8a,Player Discussion,,,,

# Introduction

As soon as free agency opened in July of 2016, the Lakers signed Timofey Mozgov to a 4 year, $64 million deal. At the time, this seemed like an enormous overpay. Today, it still seems like one. In the 2015-16 season, Mozgov averaged 6.3 PPG and 4.4 TRB in 17.4 MPG for the Cavs. The following season – his first as a Laker – his stats improved marginally. He averaged 7.4 PPG and 4.9 TRB in 20.4 MPG.

The following summer, the Lakers dumped Mozgov’s salary. They traded him along with D’Angelo Russell for Brook Lopez and the 27th pick in the draft. They used this pick to select Kyle Kuzma.

Mozgov’s contract was bad from the beginning. But, this is not always the case. Often, misfortune and other unforeseen circumstances make contracts bad. Key examples include injuries and accelerated aging. So, at the time, these contracts seem fine. But they become poison fast. In turn, the players earn much more than expected given their performance.

To find the best and worst value contracts, we’ll create 4 models to predict a player’s salary. This is not a predictive metric of what a player will earn in their next contract. This evaluates expected salary relative to real salary to see who’s overpaid and who’s underpaid.

***

# History and understanding the data

In the 1984-1985 season, the NBA instituted the salary cap. This was a bare-bones salary cap; many of the rules that influence today’s cap weren’t in place. Unrestricted free agency, rookie contracts, max contracts, etc. only came into play later.

With the salary cap, each team had to decide how to allocate their money. Early on, many teams opted for a smooth approach where they would pay lots of middling players. In the 1990-1991 season, only 9 players earned over 20% of the total salary cap. The highest-paid player was Patrick Ewing, who earned 35.8% of the salary cap. At the time, the max contract did not yet exist. This year is somewhat of an outlier. The following season, the salary distribution changed to resemble what we see today.

Larry Bird earned a staggering 56% of the Celtics’ salary cap in the 1991-1992 season. Several players started to earn more of their team’s cap, as the league shifted more towards star power. The CBA only included the max contract about a decade later. Without max contracts, Michael Jordan earned 120% of the cap for two years in his second 3-peat.

Today, due to exceptions and restrictions, teams structure their cap room to get stars. Most contending teams often have a few max players, a couple guys in the $10 million range, and lots of minimums. So, if we’re going to predict salary, we must first understand its distribution.

https://i.imgur.com/8P6jdVU.png

We see that, historically, most players earned a small percentage of the cap. This is what we would expect. With the prevalence of tanking and salary dumps, most teams will have at least one high salary guy. For a contender, this is their main star. For a tanking team, this could be someone they took on along with a draft pick (such as Melo on the Hawks).

Next, we’ll look at how different factors correlate with salary. Theoretically, better players should always earn higher salaries. So, the correlation between something like points and salary should be positive. This is because better scorers are often better players, and, in turn, should earn more.

The CBA complicates this simple relationship with the rookie scale and minimum contracts. If we’re looking at performance relative to salary, rookie contracts by far the best value in the league. Luka Doncic is playing at an incredible level, but only earns about $7.5 million. Minimum contracts create a similar effect of underpaid players. Many contenders have no cap room. So, if a player wants to contend, he must take a pay cut. For the player to join the contender, they must either take a minimum or the mid-level exception (like Cousins on the Warriors). Relative to their performance, this is a steal.

The three graphs below show the relationship between different stats and salary.

https://i.imgur.com/jFozyAw.png

https://i.imgur.com/z1W07vP.png

https://i.imgur.com/uyjQr4q.png

As expected, points and win shares correlate with salary. Furthermore, the age plot shows the effect of rookie contracts. No player under 20 years old earned over 20% of the cap.

Now that we understand the data, we can discuss the methods for the analysis.

***

# Methods

First, we collected all player data for every season since the 1990-1991 season. We go back to 1990-1991 for two reasons. First, the CBA only added unrestricted free agency in 1988. This changed the whole process of free agency – and in turn, contracts. So, we wouldn’t go back further than 1988 anyway. Second, our source for historical player salary data is [this Kaggle data set](https://www.kaggle.com/whitefero/nba-player-salary-19902017), which only goes back to 1990.

We combined the salary data with each player’s counting and advanced stats for that season. Note that we’re taking stats for the given season. So, this is not a predictive metric. This evaluates whether the player is overpaid or underpaid given their expected salary. As such, players like Gordon Hayward will appear overvalued. At the time, the contract was fair. Due to a devastating injury later, Hayward spent a full year rehabbing and still had to shake off rust. Last season, Hayward did not play like a max player. So, he was overpaid for that season.

We used the following factors to predict a player’s salary:

1. Age
2. Points per game
3. Rebounds per game
4. Assists per game
5. Steals per game
6. Blocks per game
7. True shooting %
8. Win shares

These factors generally paint a picture of a player’s performance and situation. So, they can predict a player’s salary.

We included age as a feature to adjust for rookie contracts. Though they’re great value, it’s not a result of any negotiation or offer by the GM. It’s based on the player’s draft slot. So, even a superstar 18-year-old can’t get paid a large part of the cap. Adding age nullifies the effect of rookie contracts. If we did not have age, we would likely have to remove rookie contracts, as they would add noise to our data set. This transforms the problem from salary given performance to salary given expected salary. Our definition of expected salary mixes performance and age.

We used win shares instead of VORP or BPM because win shares is a cumulative stat. So, it depends on games played, which is a key factor in how much value a player provides to his team.

To understand the relationship between these features, we created a correlation plot.

https://i.imgur.com/FlGqZkF.png

With our 10,821 samples, we randomly split the data. We used 75% to train the models, and 25% to test them. We created four models:

1. K-nearest neighbors regressor (KNN)
2. Random forest regressor (RF)
3. Gradient boosting regressor (GBR)
4. Extreme gradient boosting regressor (XGB)

Note that we’re predicting the percentage of the cap a player deserves, instead of their raw salary. The salary cap rose and inflation occurred, so players today earn more than players 20 years ago. But, the percentage of the cap stayed consistent. Because we’re predicting percentage of cap, this is a regression problem.

We predicted salary for the 2018-19 season using 2018-19 stats (last season’s numbers). So, contracts won’t exactly match up with what they are today.

We also only considered players who played in the 2018-19 season. This affects some teams; for example, the Heat paid Chris Bosh $26.8 million last season, but he did not play. Because Bosh didn’t play, he’s excluded from the data. Also, Bosh doesn’t count against the Heat’s cap because he retired for medical reasons.

One final note about the data is that there are small inconsistencies due to player movement. We collected contract data from Basketball Reference’s contract page from April 1, 2019 ([link](https://web.archive.org/web/20190401162630/https://www.basketball-reference.com/contracts/players.html)). This is after the trade deadline. So, traded players count against the team they played for at the end of the season (e.g. Marc Gasol is on the Raptors, not the Grizzlies). Some players had multiple entries on the page, like Carmelo Anthony. He earned $25 million from the Hawks (salary dump from the Thunder). Then, after the Hawks waived him, Melo signed with the Rockets for $2 million. The Rockets then traded him to the Bulls. So, Melo has a $25 million Hawks entry and a $2 million Bulls entry. We removed duplicates and kept the first-indexed one (the higher salary one).

Neither of these inconsistencies affect the analysis much. Traded players still have the same contract, so on a player-by-player basis for value, they’re the same. This only affects the team’s sum of expected and observed salary difference. In the case of Melo with two entries, there are very few of these cases where it doesn’t matter much.

# Regression analysis

In this section, we’ll check how our models perform.

## Basic goodness of fit

For regression models, we have two basic metrics of performance. First, we have r-squared. This measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (percent of cap) explained by the independent variables (features). It’s between 0 and 1, with 1 being the best possible value.

Second, we have mean squared error. This measures the average squared difference between the predicted and observed values. Unlike r-squared, lower MSE is better, with a best possible value of 0. We can interpret mean squared error, as it tells us how close our predictions are to the real value on average.

The table below shows the r-squared and mean squared error for the four models.

|Model|r-squared|MSE|
:--|--:|--:|
|KNN|0.516|0.003|
|RF|0.546|0.003|
|GBR|0.542|0.003|
|XGB|0.544|0.003|

All the models have a very low mean squared error of 0.003. We can take the square root of this (root mean squared error) to interpret the result. This differs from mean absolute error, which is the absolute value of the differences. RMSE is better here because it penalizes large errors more, so it’s more valuable for this problem.

Because the mean squared error for each model is about 0.003, the RMSE is about 0.055. This means that, on average, the models are about 5.5% off in predicted percent of cap.

In our classification problems, we create dummy classifiers to represent improvement over random. It’s harder to create a random model here. However, we can still compare our models to simple regressions. We saw before that the correlation coefficient (r) for a points and salary regression is 0.6. So, the r-squared is 0.36. Our models all have r-squared above 0.5, so they outperform simple methods to predict salary. So, the models predict salary well.

## Cross-validation

In machine learning, we want to avoid overfitting. This occurs when the models learn the given data too well. So, they’re accurate on the given data but aren’t predictive on new data. To check for overfitting, we’ll perform cross-validation.

First, as in previous posts, we performed grid search on our hyperparameters. This means we tested lots of possible combinations for factors that determine how our models fit the data. Then, we selected the combination that resulted in the lowest MSE on different splits.

Additionally, we performed k-fold cross-validation. In k-fold cross-validation, we randomly split the data into k bins. The models receive k – 1 bins as training data, and then predict the one excluded bin. We repeat this process for every combination of bins. Then, we average the performance across the bins. This gives us an estimate of how our models perform on different splits of the data. A cross-validated score close to our initial score indicates the model performs almost the same on the different splits. So, if the two scores are close, it’s unlikely the models are overfitting.

The table below shows the cross-validation scores for r-squared and MSE, along with their 95% confidence intervals (2 standard deviations away from the mean).

|Model|r-squared|95% CI|MSE|95% CI|
:--|--:|:--|--:|:--|
|KNN|0.507|+/- 0.071|0.004|+/- 0.001|
|RF|0.469|+/- 0.150|0.004|+/- 0.001|
|GBR|0.421|+/- 0.281|0.004|+/- 0.002|
|XGB|0.444|+/- 0.199|0.004|+/- 0.001|

Though the CV r-squared scores are lower, the actual r-squared scores are within the 95% confidence interval. Furthermore, the CV MSE is very close to the initial MSE. So, it’s unlikely the models are overfitting.

## Standardized residuals

A big part of regression analysis depends on analyzing the residuals. A residual is the difference between the predicted and observed value at a point.

Residuals in strong models have two important characteristics. First, they follow the normal distribution. Second, they have no autocorrelation or trend. Both these characteristics show that the model isn’t repeating the same mistake.

First, we’ll look at the standardized residuals test. Ideally, 95% of a model’s standardized residuals fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean. Furthermore, the standardized residuals should have no noticeable trend.

The graph below shows the standardized residuals of the four models.

https://i.imgur.com/MmOB3Xr.png

We see that only the KNN has 95% of its residuals within 2 standard deviations of the mean. The others are close to 95% (they’re all over 94.6%). This 95% is not a hard boundary; it exists because, in a normal distribution, 95% of data is within 2 standard deviations of the mean. So, the fact that close to 95% of the data is within 2 standard deviations is good.

The distributions of the standard residuals differ from a normal distribution. We see that the residuals peak close to 0 far above the expected density for a normal distribution. Furthermore, there are some residuals far away from most of the data. So, our residuals are probably heavy-tailed and not normal.

To analyze this assumption, we’ll perform a Shapiro-Wilk test for normality. The test returns a p-value and a w-value (not important here). If the p-value is less than 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis, which is that the data is normally distributed. So, if p &lt; 0.05, the data is not normal. The table below shows the p-values of the Shapiro-Wilk test.

|Model|p-value|
:--|:--|

The p-value is small for all four models, so we can reject the null hypothesis. So, our standardized residuals are not normally distributed. This low p-value may be a result of a large sample size. To confirm this isn’t due to sample size, we’ll also look at a quantile-quantile (QQ) plot.

The QQ plot shows the theoretical quantiles and the order values of two distributions. If the two distributions are the same, their QQ plot will be a straight line. So, we will plot the residuals against a normal distribution (shown in red). The closer our points are to the red line, the better. The graph below shows each model’s QQ plot.

https://i.imgur.com/XKAInR9.png

We see that the residuals stay close to the line for most of the middle values. At the upper and lower ends, the residuals differ a lot. This indicates the residuals have heavy tails like we thought before. So, we can confidently say the model’s residuals are not normal.

Now, we will test for autocorrelation. To do this, we’ll perform a Durbin-Watson test. The test returns a Durbin-Watson statistic between 0 and 4. Values close to 2 indicate no autocorrelation. Values close to 0 indicate positive autocorrelation. Values close to 4 indicate negative autocorrelation. The table below shows the results of the DW test.

|Model|DW statistic|
:--|--:|
|KNN|1.97|
|RF|1.99|
|GBR|1.99|
|XGB|1.99|

The DW statistic for each model is close to 2. So, there’s no autocorrelation in the residuals, which is promising.

Though our residuals are not normal, which is a problem, the models are still useful. The residuals have no autocorrelation – meaning the model is not repeating the same mistake – and the models have no error. Now that we’ve evaluated the models, we can see what they predict.

# Results

As mentioned earlier, rookie contracts are bargains. This is because their contracts depend on their draft position. Furthermore, they’re non-negotiable, as the rookie scale continues for 4 years.

Before diving into results, we’ll look at an example of how our models treat rookies. Last year, Luka Doncic put up 21.2 PPG, 7.8 RPG, and 6 APG on good efficiency at 19 years old. So, even though he’s a great player, his expected salary is low because he’s on a rookie contract.

Our models predicted Luka Doncic to earn 12% of the cap. This is higher than his actual percent of cap of about 6.5%. So, he’s still a bargain given his expected salary. However, a player putting up Doncic’s stats would earn far more than 12% of the cap on the open market. This shows that our models identify the effect of age.

Now, we’ll let the models predict what Luka Doncic would earn at 27 years old if he put up the same stats. Given Doncic was 19 his rookie year, he will start his rookie maximum contract when he’s 23. That contract will take up 25% of the cap with 8% annual raises.

The models predict Doncic will be worth 23% of the cap if he put up his rookie stats (which he’s already improved on this year) at 27 years old. This is close to what he’ll make depending on how fast the cap rises. Because of the large difference in salary depending on age, we know the models capture the effect of age. So, they won’t identify all rookie contracts as bargains, as they know the expectation for rookies.

Now that we understand this, we can examine the results.

We’ll look at both player-by-player and team-by-team differences between expected and actual percent of cap. Higher values mean the player is great value, as he’s earning below his expected salary. We can sum these across teams to see which teams overpay players and which teams get good value.

The graph below shows the top 10 best value contracts as decided by the average of our four models.

https://i.imgur.com/eOuZ2nX.png

This list has some players we’d expect. Last season, Kemba earned only $12 million, a great value. Several of the players here signed a minimum contract or an exception like DeMarcus Cousins and Brook Lopez. Despite our earlier example of how the models filter out rookie contracts, there are still two rookie contract players here. But, they’re both older than typical rookie contract players. Last season, both Buddy Hield and Malcolm Brogdon were 26 years old. This is about as old as a player can get on their rookie contract unless they’re an international player. So, their age prevents their expected value from regressing to that of a rookie contract.

Now, let’s look at the worst value contracts.

https://i.imgur.com/9sMW9La.png

This contains the usual suspects for the worst contracts. Before his improvement this year, Andrew Wiggins had one of the worst contracts in the league. Furthermore, Hayward’s injury recovery made him perform far below what you’d expect for a max player. We also have some less recent poison contracts, like Otto Porter, Chandler Parsons, and Ryan Anderson.

Let’s look at which teams handed out the best contracts last year. We do this by summing the difference in expected and actual salary for every player on the roster.

https://i.imgur.com/AwfwAHv.png

All the teams on this list have lots of good role players or young talent. Though the Lakers, Pelicans, and Bucks all had a max player (LeBron, Davis, Giannis), a max is great value for those players. Furthermore, the rest of the team had great value contracts. We see that the teams here made big moves over the summer, often resulting in improvement. The Lakers added Davis. The Pelicans added young talent. The Nets signed Kyrie and KD. The 76ers signed Horford. The Clippers signed Kawhi and traded for Paul George.

Now, let’s look at the teams with the worst value contracts.

https://i.imgur.com/WTRsFWA.png

OKC had the worst cumulative value difference by a large value. Westbrook’s max and Steven Adams’ large contract contribute to this. We see that a lot of the teams here ended up tanking or in limbo. For example, the Thunder traded Westbrook and George. The struggling Pistons held onto Griffin and Drummond and now look even worse.

Though it’s bad to be a team in the above graph, for tanking teams, it can be good. Tanking teams often receive salary dumps, where they take on a bad contract in exchange for picks. So, they’ll have a negative difference, but it’s worth it because of the attached assets.

Let’s look at the distribution of our predicted salary relative to the actual salary distribution.

https://i.imgur.com/MnTBjPv.png

We see that the predicted distribution is a right-shift of the observed distribution. Minimum contracts and exceptions contribute to this, as good players often take discounts to play for contenders.

# Why do the models predict what they do?

Now that we’ve seen the performance and results of the model, we’ll look at what influences their prediction. To do this, we’ll use Shapley values. Shapley value estimates the marginal contribution of a feature through all possible combinations. This allows us to see what features are most important, and what values for these features create the most impact. For example, we know that a low value for age will result in a low predicted salary because of rookie contracts. But, is age a big predictor of salary in all cases? Or does it only matter for young players, after which other factors matter more?

Shapley values let us answer these questions. The four graphs below show the Shapley values for each feature in our four models. The y-axis sorts features by their importance (most important is on top). The x-axis shows the Shapley value, or the impact on model output. The color of each point shows the actual feature value. So, for example, older players have red “age” points, because their age is higher.

https://i.imgur.com/C9KMlRx.png

https://i.imgur.com/NDj3Cgd.png

https://i.imgur.com/PErAr70.png

https://i.imgur.com/nJ5w1vL.png

All four models have points, age, and rebounds as their top 3 features in that order. Notice that the feature importance for the RF, GBR, and XGB follow the same order. Because all three of these models are tree-based models, they fit the data in similar ways. So, the same feature sets affect the models to a similar extent.

We see that rebounds don’t have much of an effect on model output unless the player recorded a lot of rebounds. This makes sense, as most top bigs will rack up rebounds. Meanwhile, guards and wings won’t record lots of rebounds, but that shouldn’t affect them.

The plots give more proof to the effect of rookie contracts and age. In each model, low values of age have the largest negative impact on model output. But, there’s an interesting trend with high values of age. We’d expect high values of age not to affect output, given that older players often earn less because they’re expected to decline. However, high values of age positively impact model outputs. This explains some of the odd results of the models, such as why LaMarcus Aldridge has a higher predicted salary than Giannis.

***

# Conclusion

When offering players contracts, GMs try to give better players more money. By giving models basic indicators of player performance, we can almost pinpoint what a player should earn.

We could expand this to predict a player’s salary in year n given their performance in year n – 1. This allows us to predict how much a player should earn before they start their contract or pick their team. However, this analysis would be much less accurate than what we did here. It’s hard to predict how players will progress between seasons or how different schemes affect their production. Over one summer, so much changes. In the course of a single season, player performance is much easier to predict. So, this works because it’s a retrospective look at value, instead of a future prediction.

Some interesting takeaways:

The 60s were the most top heavy NBA in terms of championship teams at 2, with Russell's Celtics taking all but 1 title which went to Wilt's 76ers.

The 70s on the other hand had the most parity among NBA decades. No team won more than two championships this decade, and rematches between teams were rare (the Knicks and Lakers faced each other in 1970 then in 1972, while the Sonics and Bullets faced each other in 78 and 79).

In terms of number of championship teams, the 2010s appear to have the second most parity, as no team won more than three championships and five teams won one championship each. However, this belies some context: The Warriors would make five Finals appearances in the decade from 2015 to 2019, with only the Heat, Cavaliers, and Spurs the only other teams with multiple Finals appearances in this decade. In addition, the Heat and Cavaliers both had LeBron James at various points during this decade; James (alongside James Jones) would make eight straight Finals from 2011 to 2018.

The 80s being the Magic/Bird decade and the 90s being the age of Jordan is certainly a fact as seen here. The Lakers would win five in the 80s, making the Finals 8 out of 10 years (with Houston representing the West in 1981 and 1986). The Celtics would win 3 in the same decade and make 5 Finals. Interestingly, every team that appeared in at least one Finals this decade would appear in multiple Finals in this decade; aside from the Lakers and Celtics, the Sixers would appear in 3, the Rockets in 2, and the Pistons likewise in 2.

On the other hand, while the Bulls dominated the 90s, there would only be three other teams making multiple Finals in this decade, with the Blazers, Rockets, and Jazz all making two each.

Since coming 2nd in DPOY voting to Rudy Gobert last year, it looks like Giannis has seemingly improved more on the defensive end this year too. Statistically speaking, Giannis is:

1. #1 in defensive rating with a 95.9 rating. Brook Lopez is #2 at 98.2. 

2. #1 in defensive win shares at 2.7. Anthony Davis is #2 at 2.3. 

3.  #3 in defensive box plus minus at 4.8. Nerlens Noel leads at 5.5,  but only plays 18 minutes a game. Jonathan Issac edges Giannis with a 5.0.

4. 6th in rebounds per game (13.0 a game) and 9th in defensive rebounding percentage.

5. 37th in steals per game (1.3 per game) , tied for 24th in blocks per game (1.2 per game), and is tied for 50th in deflections per game (2.4 per game).

6. Opponents are shooting 38.9 percent from the field, when guarded by Giannis. Most notably his rim protection, where he is only allowing 43.7 percent shooting less than 6 feet, where his opponents usual shoot 59.1 percent from less than 6 feet. 

7. Milwaukee Bucks are the #1 defense in the league. They are #1 in Defensive Rating by 3 points, #1 in rebounds, allow the fewest 2nd Chance points in the league, fewest points per game in the paint, and the Bucks are allowing a league best 41 percent field goal percentage. 

8. He’s the best defensive player on the best defensive team in the league. I know Lopez is an elite rim protector, but Giannis is still the defensive anchor and best overall defender on the team. His versatility from being able to guard 1-5, to being able to completely shut down pick and rolls and transition defense, the rim protection and off ball movement rotations he completes, and the athleticism to stay with smaller, shiftier players. Bledsoe is an elite perimeter defender, but Milwaukee played without him for over 2 weeks, and they still held the top defense in the league. Giannis overall, is the clear best defender on the best defensive team, and going by the nature of the award, this is a very strong argument for Giannis. 

9. I know this is unscientific and more opinion based, but he completely passes the eye test too. The effort, non stop hustle, the defensive instincts, and versatility are all there. He’s a very high IQ defensive player, has really good defensive technique, and he is uniquely gifted with his size and athleticism, which gives him insane versatility. 


Question:


Giannis is the favorite to win the MVP currently. Do you think him winning the MVP could impact his DPOY chances? Or do you think voters would be inclined to give Giannis the chance to become the 2nd player in history to possibly win DPOY, MVP, and finals MVP in history, while solidifying himself as the best current player in the game?

Before seeing the results, I was pretty sure that the starting slots were a competition between Kyle Lowry, Kemba Walker and Bradley Beal. Certainly, it seems like some voters disagreed.

The list for guards was as follows:

1. Trae Young
2. Kyrie Irving
3. Kemba Walker
4. Derrick Rose
5. Zach LaVine
6. Ben Simmons
7. Jaylen Brown
8. Kyle Lowry
9. Bradley Beal
10. Spencer Dinwiddie

I fully believe that Trae Young will be an all-star starter one day, but, despite his gaudy per game stats, he is one of the league's worst defenders (-2.9 DBPM), and leads a 7-27 team. His win shares (2.6) are well behind other top contenders, and [his RPM does not rank in the top 40 among point guards](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/position/1). I get that it is a popularity contest, and Trae has a flashy game, but second year players need to prove a lot to be all-star starters, and his effectiveness just doesn't seem to be there yet, even though the potential clearly is.

Irving seems like he simply shouldn't be on the ballot. If he had stayed healthy, he probably gets a starting slot legitimately, but he has played 11 games, and has missed almost twice as many games as he has played, with no return date set yet.

Derrick Rose seems like a popularity pick, as he ranked high last year, but I can't believe too many people think that he is a real all star. He is a bench player who plays 24.4 minutes per game.

Zach LaVine is flashy, but he is a highly inconsistent player who leads a disappointing 13-21 Bulls team that was supposed to be a team set for a leap this year. His win shares (2.2) are well below other top guards, [and he ranks 32nd in RPM among point guards](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/position/1).

Simmons has more of a case, but still doesn't feel like a starter. His advanced stats are actually pretty good (3.9 win shares, and 10th among point guards for RPM), but it's tough to ignore that his team has drastically underperformed this year. The Sixers were supposed to be right there with the Bucks as the class of the East, and currently sit in 6th place. Simmons seems to refuse to shoot threes, even though he seems to have shown himself capable of doing so. He is an excellent defender, but he still has a very incomplete offensive game. I see him as an All Star, but not a starter.

Similarly, with Jaylen Brown, he is having a breakout year, and could be an All-Star, depending on how many Celtics make the team (as Tatum and Walker are also candidates), but doesn't strike me as having earned a starting slot.

Beal is a guy that I thought would be up at the top of the standings, as his per game stats are awesome, even though his advanced stats aren't great. His per game stats are boosted by his team's ridiculous pace (they average 116.2 points for and 121 points against per game). His team is also terrible. But, he is a well-established star, who puts up great per game stats.

The guys that I think deserve the two slots are Kyle Lowry and Kemba Walker.

I was really surprised to see Lowry so far down the list. He has made the last 5 All Star games. Won a chip since last year's All Star Game, and is putting up great offensive numbers this year, while doing Kyle Lowry things around the court (taking charges, getting steals, diving for loose balls, and being the heart and soul of the Raptors). He has 3.1 win shares, which ranks ahead of every other guard on the list except Kemba (4.0) and Simmons (3.9), but has done so despite playing only 23 games (Kemba has played 32 and Simmons has played 34). He ranks well in RPM (14th for point guards, in a virtual tie with Kemba who is at 13, and just behind Simmons, who is at 10). And, he is the leader of a team that has drastically outperformed expectations this year, despite all the team's injuries. He led that bonkers 30 comeback against the Mavs, playing with mostly bench guys, and also led the Raps to a big win over the Celtics, with Siakam on the sidelines.

For Kemba, his candidacy feels pretty solid. He is the leader of one of the East's other big surprises of the year. He has the highest win shares of any Eastern Conference guard, and is right next to Lowry and Simmons for RPM.

So, ultimately, Lowry and Kemba are my choices for Eastern Conference starters, with Simmons and Beal as backups.

While the Spurs are still projected to make the playoffs, there’s no denying that they’ve looked *bad* this year. They’re below .500 and playing uninspired defense—unthinkable for a Spurs team. And it’s not like their struggles just started this season. Even last year, there was something subtly “off” about how the team was performing.

Of course, it be remiss to not address the state of the roster. Most teams would be left floundering if they lost a top 5 player in Kawhi Leonard. Furthermore, his replacement, Demar Derozan, is a deeply flawed player. Advanced stats have never been very fond of Derozan, so it may be that despite his gaudy scoring, he is a major contributor to the Spur’s newfound mediocrity.

But still—while there are a lot of good excuses to make for Pop, I think his status as the best coach in the league is no longer unassailable. The Raptors have been in a similar situation to the Spurs—lost Kawhi with little compensation, a half-decade of draft picks outside the lottery—but they are still a robust playoff team in an increasingly competitive East. Or look at Indiania. They lost Victor Oladipo and have barely missed a beat. It seems like every game they have seven players in double figures.

While I still believe Pop is a top 5 coach, my gut feeling is that if he was still the *best* coach in the league, the Spurs would look better than they have. 

If I had to nominate two contenders for best coach in the league, they would be Nick Nurse or Coach Bud. Both have done outstanding jobs the past two years. Brad Stevens is a contender as well.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,74489,public,self,Is Pop No Longer The Best Coach In The League?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ej5mna/is_pop_no_longer_the_best_coach_in_the_league/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Contracts don't matter, all that matters is how well the player would fit into the system. Put on your GM hats, find the right player for the right team.

As an ""out there"" example, I think that Trae Young could push the 76ers into contention. It would allow Harris to play his natural position as a PF and be a threat on the perimeter. His ball dominance might be a down-side as Sixers already have a ball-dominant guard in Simmons but I think the upside is worth it. JRich at 3, Harris at 4 and Horford backing up Embiid at 5 feels more natural than what they are doing now.

A more natural fit could be Draymond on the Clippers. Clippers with the defensive talent of Kawhi, PG and Draymond would be able to roll out the deadliest small-ball line up since the Hampton Five. Kawhi and PG would draw enough attention that Draymond could hopefully recreate his 2015-2017 3pt shooting and punish teams for the double teams that are inevitably going to be thrown at Kawhi/PG. It'd be a huge upgrade from the defense that the Clippers are currently employing where it feels like Kawhi, Bev and PG are trying to take on entire offenses by themselves and defensively they can't afford to sit 2 of them at the same time.

He's exactly the type of point guard they were looking for in the first place; a killer three point shooter who can bring some secondary playmaking to the table. He may have cost himself a strong contract by not going into free agency last off-season (although I think he can get some of that back during this coming free agency class) but that doesn't mean his chance at a ring is gone.

That all being said, I don't watch a lot of Clippers games and I can't say how he'd fit on that team. I imagine he'd have a more fleshed out role with the Lakers.

My Personal list is as such 

1. Giannis.  - Reigning MVP. Athletic super freak. Has legitimately gotten better every year of his career and now has a 3pt game. 

2. Luka. - Dude is 20 playing at mvp level. Breaking Lebron and MJ records. Looks like a leader and a world wide super star the likes of which we haven’t seen since LBJ early career. 



This is where list changes for most in my opinion. 


3. AD - the decade is also about winning now. And AD is one of the best players In the world now and still young enough to keep that up through Atleast 2025. Any team with him and another all star is a serious title favorite and his Ability to take over games is second only to Giannis and harden this year 

4. KAT - Entering his Prime and currently the only player in top 10 in scoring that’s shooting 40% from 3. Now you may think (yah cause he’s a post player) but that’s simply not true he’s averaging 8 - 3PTA a game! I see him getting moved or leaving and winning a title with Booker or Luka or someone within the next 5 years. 

5. Embiid - The Big Man has a few all NBA under his belt already and is bonafide top 3 center in the league. His defense is elite and I think him having guards on his team who can space the floor could make him even better on offense.

He wasn’t always the most popular during his tenure, but it’s clear now that he was a massive influence in helping the NBA to where it is today. I think he’s the best Pro-Sports commissioner of his era. 

Some of his accomplishments:

• Worked as a lawyer during the NBA/ABA merger before he was commish. Loose Balls (great book, highly recommend) highlights Stern’s efforts during this era, and shows how it wouldn’t have happened without him.
• He created player free agency during this process, also the salary cap
• Distanced league image away from the “cocaine era”
• He personally did a lot of work on the league’s television rights, parlaying the famous tape-delayed finals into today’s massive TV deals
• A huge portion of the NBA’s Global efforts are a result of Stern 
• Expanded league to 30 teams (such a tough process to execute well, expansion teams failed many times during NBA’s history)
• Helped create NBA league pass
• Beat the 2012 lockout as a last hurrah (also 3 others during his reign)

I really think Stern is an NBA great, these are just some of his accomplishments. 

I hypothesize, as with anyone is his position, that a lot of his best work comes behind closed doors. We don’t really hear about the day to day battles, and I think Stern has done even more than meets the eye. 

I’m also curious how Stern would handle some of the challenges Silver is facing right now. I’m a fan of Silver, but haven’t loved how the soon-to-be rule changes have come about. I wonder how Stern would face the declining ratings and need to “switch things up”.

So yes we will be adding teams, more than usual but I think it’ll ultimately make some sense. 

Divisions of 5. 
Play division teams 4 times each. 
Play every other team 2 times. 
So 72 game season that makes divisions and division rivalries more important. 

Still 16 team playoffs...
-Division winner automatic playoff bid and home court in round 1. 7 teams 

Mid season tournament for another automatic playoff spot and automatic home court in first round. So 8 teams now

7 best record non division winners get playoff bids 

Next 4 best records play a 4 team single elimination tournament for final spot. 

New teams 
Montreal, Louisville, Mexico City, Seattle, Vancouver or Calgary

Divisions
Montreal, Toronto, Boston, Brooklyn, New York

Philly, DC, Cleveland, Detroit, Louisville

Minnesota, Chicago, Milwaukee, Indiana, Memphis

Charlotte, Atlanta, New Orleans, Orlando, Miami

Dallas, San Antonio, Houston, OKC, Mexico City

Sacramento (maybe move to Vegas) Golden State, Lakers, Clippers, Phoenix

Portland, Utah, Denver, Seattle, Vancouver or Calgary

I think this would make a mid season tournament something not only worth watching but also worth preparing for and trying in.

This also gives divisions a reason to even exist since those are the teams you see the most and beating them and winning your division guarantees you hosting a playoff series. All in all I think this would work well beyond the obvious problems of adding 5 franchises at once.

Watching this clip I can’t help but wonder why KLove doesn’t explore lowering his guaranteed salary to make a trade easier to swallow. 

Western Conference teams like Denver, LAC, and Dallas would probably be willing to deal with a 34.5 year old KLove at the end of the contract if the salary # was lower, and the same logic would apply to pretty much every Eastern Conference playoff seed team right now with the exception of the Magic. 

I know we’re talking about millions of dollars, but if time really is the ultimate commodity and KLove has already made so much it feels like he should consider fixing the market for himself.

I feel like both teams get better, in terms of what each team gets:

***

**BOSTON**

 **Offence:**

* We already have three 3-level scoring wings atm competing for shots. A pass-first PG fits that lineup better than a score-first one.   

* We also have scorers (especially Tatum) who want to hold the ball down the stretch as well as one of the better late-game coaches in the league. Simmons' late-game passiveness isn't really an issue for Boston.

* A lot of people talk about surrounding Ben with shooters (which we can), but we also have ball-handlers to take the pressure off him in the half-court, our offence is capable of being a lot more fluid than Philly's is. 

* Because we don't have a logjam of PF/Cs we can actually get by using him as a front-court playmaker in addition to his PG responsibilities. He doesn't have to only be *'big Rondo'* in the halfcourt we could also use him the same way teams use a Jokic / Gasol / Horford / Bogut / Draymond. Have him establish a position and hit the cutting guard/wing. 



**Defence:**

 

* We're running a perimeter-centric, switch-heavy defence and we're looking to pressure the ball and force (and score off) a lot of turnovers. Simmons fits that defensive system perfectly. 

 Adding Simmons to:
  
 * Brown's on-ball pressure
 * Tatum's ability to disrupt passing lanes
 * Smart's general ability to cause mayhem and force mistakes everywhere he goes
 
 Would be devastating defensively. Boston would comfortably lead the league in forced turnovers and perimeter defence (I would argue even over a team like LAC).



**Timeline:**

* *Simmons / Brown / Tatum* is one hell of a young trio going forward and all three would be locked down for the next 4 years minimum. That's before we count guys like Smart (who's only 25) and the young guys we're in the process of developing (Romeo, Grant, Rob, Tremont, Carson) and all the picks we have incoming (Next draft: Memphis', Boston's Milwaukee's 1st round picks). 

 
 

**Other:**

 * We're already experimenting with small-ball lineups because our coach is an absolute fiend for playing small and because it's the only way we can reasonably get our best 5 on the court. 

  *Smart / Brown / Hayward / Tatum / Simmons* would work incredibly well on both ends of the court. 

  It's not something you could use against a team with a dominant post-scorer like Philly, but we'd throw this lineup at Milwaukee / Indiana / Brooklyn / Miami every day of the week.


**Boston:**  Simmons fits Boston's *rebuild/develop while competing* mindset. It's not like the Celtics are going to be forced into a tank, they're still going to be one of the most competitive teams in the league, this trade would just help them keep that contention window open for longer and maybe increase the chances of a title down the line as all their young stars align in their primes.

 
***

**Philadelphia**   

**Offence:**

* Kemba has in his arsenal every serious on-ball scoring skill that Philly is lacking right now. In terms of scoring, Simmons can get to the basket. Kemba can do that **and**: 
      * He can pull-up and shoot from anywhere
      * He can run the PnR / PnP
      * He can score in ISO
      * He can get to the line and reliably shoot FTs
      * He's incredibly capable of being that clutch scorer that they're sorely missing since Butler left
      
* Kemba's a serious off-ball threat, not only can he play the role of a star PG but he can seamlessly switch into the role of a suped-up JJ Redick whenever he wants. He's not only going to score on his own, but he's also going to create space for the other 76ers


**Defence:**

* Despite his stature, it's not like Kemba is some insurmountable drain on a team's defences (Boston are also top 5 while starting Kemba).

 Defence will be the big ESPN talking point if the trade were to happen, but Kemba is surprisingly active on that end. He puts the effort in, he communicates well, he's one of the best in the league at drawing charges.

 Philly would feel the loss of Simmons on the defensive end, but with a dominant defensive force like Embiid (and the development of their young wings like Matisse), Philly are still going to be a top 5-ish defensive team.

**Timeline:**

 * I would argue Kemba fits Philly's timeline better than Simmons does. Good young talent is never a bad thing, but Philly spent a lot of money on mature-age talent and should now try to strike while the iron is hot, a short term improvement makes sense:
 
       * Horford isn't getting any younger
       * Embiid/Harris/JRich are all in or around their primes
       * Embiid's not going to be playing well into his 30s. He's big. He's heavy. He's injury-prone. At 25, Philly realistically needs to be working on a 5-year timeline.
        
    Winning now is Philly's best chance with Embiid. Trying to wait 3-4 years for Simmon's shooting to develop will put them in a real bind.


**Other:**

* Simmons is fast and dynamic and he wants to run the floor. Embiid is big and bulky and while he can be explosive he doesn't want to run a marathon every game. 

     Rather than having two stars trying to push the franchise in opposite directions, Kemba can slot perfectly into Embiid's slow/deliberate probing style of offence. 


* Kemba's not just a max player in his own right, he would open up possibilities for the other guys Philly have dedicated big contracts too.  

    *eg. Horford is one of the best players in the league at getting the most out of PGs, you'd be giving him a PG he can flex his skills with.* 





**Conclusion:** Philly loses one of the better young assets in the league for a 29-year-old with the hopes of turning their top-5 defence and middling offence into roster built around serious contention and elite level play on both sides of the court. 

 Their contention window loses width but gains depth.

***

For me, the biggest issue is sentimentality. 

* Kemba's been an absolute god-send in terms of how wonderful of a person he is. Boston really needed that after last year and it's hard to find any real complaints with what he actually brings to the table basketball-wise. Kemba hasn't given Boston any reason to trade him away. 

* Simmons is supposed to be 1/2 of the hopes and dreams of Philadelphia, it's a big ask for them to move on from him and it's always hard to trade young talent. There's also the option to go in another direction and maybe trade other players.

Even if he never blossoms into a true star I am positive that at worst he will be a Draymond-type elite role player on a contender.

People are way too harsh on him. He is a #2 pick only in his third season and he has missed a ton of time due to injuries. Since the day he was drafted I am convinced that his potential is sky high. A lot has changed in his game since he was drafted - his shooting fell off a cliff, and he was an elite defender right out of the gate. But my evaluation of him remained very high because the #1 reason I liked him was his elite intangibles.

Lonzo remains an elite passer and defender, but IMO his true strengths are: his unselfish desire to pass and make his teammates better, his elite court vision, and his ability to dictate pace using his energy and natural game being to push and pass the ball forward. He could be a Draymond type player on a contender: versatile and elite defender and playmaker who pushes the pace and excels in transition. 

His true strengths are his core intangibles, natural born vision, and his unselfish play style. His passing, defense, etc. are the by-product of his core strengths (court vision and hustle) rather than those things being his strengths themselves.

The problem right now is that he’s mentally figuring the NBA game out. Despite his elite court vision, the reason he struggles to create in a half court situation is because he’s not a scoring threat at all. Despite his size he struggles at driving to the rim, and his shot just disappeared his rookie season.

However, all of his problems are not hard to solve in theory. When he does decide to go to a hard drive, he’s actually good at finishing due to his size and frame, but he rarely looks for his own shot; unfortunately, his unselfish style of play hampers his team’s half court offense because defenders don’t respect his scoring ability which ends up limiting his passing ability. This is one his biggest flaws and one of the easier ones to fix. He has all the physical tools; he’s strong, big, and quick, and driving more often would create more scoring opportunities for both himself and his teammates.

His shooting is another thing that has limited him so far in his NBA career but I am confident that he’ll be a capable shooter eventually. Early on in his career, there were multiple signs (bad form, poor FT numbers) that indicated that his elite shooting in college (55/41/67 !!!) was an anomaly and that he never would truly figure it out in the NBA. This is one area where injuries have hurt him a lot - it feels like he actually is getting a feel for the game, and he gets hot for stretches. However, Lonzo unfortunately usually goes down while he is on a good shooting stretch. His FT numbers were never that good but he had stretches where he was shooting above 40% from 3 before he got injured. Initially it’s easy to dismiss this as just another hot streak but he’s consistently gone on streaks where he’s played and shot well, until he gets injured and he’s cold immediately after returning. To me it’s clearly a mental issue, and once he gets healthy he’ll go back to being a good shooter.

Now, let’s talk about his situation on the Pelicans. Although the popular opinion is that Gentry should be fired for underperforming this year, I think the Pelicans should stay patient and continue developing their young talent and see how they look after a healthy Zion comes back. I actually really liked the Pelicans roster construction this year outside of a glaring lack of shooting. It was very similar to the formula they used 2 seasons ago where they swept the Blazers:

-	Have 2 elite defensive guards who can make plays, force turnovers, and push the pace in transition (Rondo/Jrue -&gt; Lonzo/Jrue)
-	Dominant big (AD -&gt; Zion)
-	Defense oriented squad that thrives in transition

The one thing that team lacked was an elite wing, someone who could score in a half court setting and take the pressure off their superstar big. Those Pelicans teams were notorious for basically having no capable wings. In Brandon Ingram they have an MIP candidate and blossoming star who perfectly fits the rest of this team. 

Despite the Pelicans struggles, I maintain that they should stay with the currently constructed roster. They’re not losing because of their roster they’re losing because their good players are injured and their team is still young and needs time to gel. 

If they keep Jrue he’ll be fantastic for mentoring Lonzo. JJ has also popped up a lot in trade discussions but keeping him could do wonders for Lonzo’s shooting and hopefully improve his form. Gentry looks terrible so far this season but he was the one who designed that aforementioned game plan vs the Blazers that Lonzo fits so well in, I’d stay patient and give him at least until the end of this lost season to see if Lonzo develops any better under him. 

**TL;DR: Lonzo has some glaring flaws in his game currently, but they are all easily fixable and he has the physical tools, work ethic, and mentality to improve in all of those areas. The only thing that would hinder his development is if his injury woes continue to bother him throughout his career.  The Pelicans shouldn’t panic right now and should stay patient with their young roster.**",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,74240,public,self,I still believe that Lonzo Ball can be a star some day,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ei8j88/i_still_believe_that_lonzo_ball_can_be_a_star/,,,,,,,,099e778a-8b9a-11e8-b53d-0eebf66bed8a,Player Discussion,,,,

The only problem is, well...the price obviously. My team's avg courtside costs  low end $800. Not something the usual salary person can do more than once a year or so. 

I wanted to help out all the fellow fans out there and tell you'll how I've managed to sit courtside for around a dozen games so far this season.

Here's a step by step on how you can do this.

Step 1:
Order your entry price ticket (usually around $25-$40 

Step 2: Go on Ticketmaster and look for a game with courtside tickets still available. (Make sure to pick ones that are highlighted blue because this means they haven't been sold and aren't just re-sale tickets that someone could come claim)

Step 3: Click on the tickets you want use and write down (or just remember) the section, row, and seat number.

Step 4: Screenshot your entry priced ticket and then open it on Instagram story editor (or abode picture editor)

Step 5: Scribble over the seat number, section etc.....
Try to make it look as legit as possible.
Then copy the information from the open seats you found on Ticketmaster to your ticket.

Step 6: Look like you belong. 
Most of the people who sit courtside come in business casual attire. 
Try to wear something similar to church clothes.

Step 7: They generally won't scan the ticket when you walk down to the court. Just make sure to act like you belong and you'll be alright.

I know that it's annoying to wear church clothes to a basketball game....but deal with it.  
You're about to sit courtside and have the time of your life.

Are 
Championships important? Yes. But, there are 30 teams and one trophy. Not every player is going to have the stars align to win a title. Some are doomed by being drafted or traded to teams out of title contention. And some players are fortunate to be drafted into incredible situations. Let’s take Mitch Richmond and Scottie Pippen and compare the two.

Richmond spent his prime with the Sacramento Kings, a historically inept franchise (Outside the Chris Webber era from 98-05, the Kings have made the playoffs twice since moving to Sacramento in 1985). In 7 seasons with Sacramento, Richmond was a six time All-Star and five time All-NBA selection while averaging 23.3 ppg, 3.7 rpg, and 4.1 apg on 45.3 FG%/40.4 3p%/84.7 FT%.

Those are highly respectable numbers for a high volume scoring guard who is a primary option. Richmond was also a solid defender, but that is overshadowed due to Sacramento routinely playing a high pace and carrying a bottom-10 defense.

Richmond never had a championship caliber supporting cast. His best teammates during his time in Sacramento were Wayman Tisdale, Spud Webb, Brian Grant, Corliss Williamson, Walt Williams, Lionel Simmons, and a post-injury Mahmoud Abdul Rauf (If you don’t remember half of these guys I don’t blame you). He never played with another All-Star or an All-Defensive team member in Sacramento, and none of the above players earned any all-league selections in the duration of their careers, outside of Williamson winning sixth man of the year with Detroit in 2001/02.

In contrast, Pippen during those same prime years from 91-98 (Richmond and Pippen were drafted a year apart but are the same age) obviously played for the Chicago Bulls. He put up 20.3 ppg, 7.3 rpg, 5.9apg with over 3 steals and a block combined on 47.9 FG%/33.9 3P%/70.5 FT%. Pippen’s numbers are incredible all around stats and earned him 7 All-Star nods, 10 All-Defensive team selections, and 7 All-NBA teams.

Pippen was part of incredible teams with Chicago winning 5 titles during that seven year run. He played alongside Michael Jordan (Maybe the best player of all-time), Horace Grant (One of the best role-players of all time), Dennis Rodman, BJ Armstrong, Toni Kukoc, and Ron Harper. Excluding MJ, Pippen’s teammates in his prime were selected to 3 All-Star games, 9 All-Defensive teams, and twice to All-NBA teams.

Pippen had far better teammates than Richmond ever did, even when excluding Jordan. Ron Harper was a walking bucket in the early 90’s but few remember that because he played for the Clippers and Cavs. With the Clippers he averaged 20.1ppg/6.1rpg/4.6apg in 1993 before signing with Chicago, and could’ve signed elsewhere to continue to be a primary scorer. He completely adjusted his game to focus on defense and playmaking while seeing a large reduction in playing time (18 minutes per game less than a year prior). While his stats with the Bulls don’t jump off the page, he was instrumental to them three-peating a second time. BJ Armstrong was one of the best 3 point shooters in the NBA during Pippen’s prime, and Kukoc will be remembered as one of the first great European players to come over to the NBA who developed into a phenomenal bench scorer (one time sixth man of the year).

Bringing Jordan into the conversation, you acknowledge that for all of his prime, except for the 1993/94 season (Jordan’s first retirement), Pippen was the second option. Once again, I need to clarify, this doesn’t take a way from his individual greatness. He was a great player, but with Jordan demanding more defensive attention than any other player in the league, it is undeniable that Pippen reaped the rewards.

He got many more open shots and was on the receiving end of Jordan’s playmaking and floor vision. Conversely, Richmond never benefited from the ease of another star. Spud Webb was at best a slightly above average playmaker and the same can be said of Abdul-Rauf, who was more of a shooting guard forced to play point guard due to his smaller stature.

Again, this is not meant to slight the abilities of Pippen or any of these other players. I just think it is important to realize how the surrounding environment of a player, the things they cannot control, is often as impactful as their play. If Pippen were in the place of Richmond, he undoubtedly would still be a great player, but maybe his efficiency drops. Or he makes less all star appearances, all-defensive teams, and all-nba teams due to the fact that there is a voter bias towards winning teams. That may sound like nonsense, but this is a very real thing.

There are great players on bad teams and their lack of winning is often a reason used for them to not make an all-league team. While I understand the importance of winning, I think the problem with this is that we create issues like the case of Mitch Richmond. If he’d been on more successful teams, he likely would’ve received more all-star votes, all-nba votes, and media attention in general. By voting more for players on winning teams that are borderline stars, that are better noticed and held in a more positive light due to team success, we can create false narratives.

Richmond is lucky to have found his way into the Hall of Fame as many players in his situation haven’t been so lucky. By shorting players a few all star games or league selections, we hurt how they are viewed in the future. 20 years from now, few will remember the game played on local TV in November. They will however, notice a player who makes only six all-star games as opposed to nine or ten. You can’t go back and watch every game, all you have are stats, word of mouth, and highlight mixes on youtube. Can you see why the way players receive votes is important? This can build or degrade a player’s legacy. And these players are human just like you or me, just probably taller…a lot taller.

Winning is important, it is one of the greatest indicators of success, but I have an issue with using the success of a team as the sole gauge of the success of an individual. We often over emphasize individuals on a successful team, while discrediting individuals on a less successful team. For instance, Robert Horry, regarded as one of the most clutch shooters of all time, is vastly overrated.

Horry was a good player who was on some freakin incredible teams. He was fantastic at knowing his role and being part of a championship formula. Horry averaged 12ppg at his peak, and was never in consideration for any league honors (Outside of an all-rookie team). So, when someone tries to use his team success to say that he’s more deserving of a hall of fame spot than a player like Mitch Richmond who couldn’t achieve the same team success, I think that’s horse shit. Horry was a good player, GOOD, Richmond was GREAT. The Hall of Fame is for the greatest players to play the game and Richmond is undeniably one of them.

Do I think Richmond and Pippen switching places changes things? Definitely. Pippen is one of the greatest all-around players ever and was a better player, but trying to subjectively see how their careers could’ve been different with other circumstances is important. I’m not writing this to tear players apart; quite the contrary. People (NBA players are people too) deserve to be remembered for what they did, and remembered accurately. We need to stop slandering athletes for what they didn’t do, and remembering the great things they did do, because we impact their reputations tomorrow with what we say today.

Players like Chris Webber (Who should be a hall of famer already!!), Shawn Marion, Ama’re Stoudemire, and Dwight Howard are some great examples of others who have had their hall of fame chances hurt by bias and injury. While players like Vlade Divac, Dennis Johnson, and James Worthy, who are all solid players in their own right, garnered accolades due to incredible team success which helped them reach the Hall of Fame. None of these players were better than Chris Webber or Dwight, James Worthy was good but Dwight and C Webb are inexplicably better.

Mitch Richmond was a great player, and a deserving hall of famer, and while I don’t expect you to agree with me, I do hope that you take something positive away from this article

Please let me know what you think, and if you have any others I'd love to hear them!

&amp;#x200B;

TRADE 1: Phoenix Suns

SUNS RECEIVE: Karl-Anthony Towns, Noah Vonleh; WOLVES RECEIVE: Tyler Johnson, Deandre Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Ty Jerome, Suns 2021 Top-10 Protected 1st Round Pick

Reasoning: The Suns have been rumored to be interested in KAT to pair up with Devin Booker, and taking a swing at him could help boost their team into the playoff conversation, and change the overall culture from a yearly bottom feeder to at least somewhat competitive. Tyler Johnson is salary filler (and would probably be either bought out or traded after), and Ayton, Bridges and Jerome are all young, developing players with high potential. Losing all three and the first rounder may seem like an overpay, but the pick is protected, and Ayton is coming off of a long suspension, which will decrease the values of both.

&amp;#x200B;

TRADE 2: Knicks 

KNICKS RECEIVE: Karl-Anthony Towns; WOLVES RECEIVE: Julius Randle, Kevin Knox, Alonzo Trier, 2023 1st Round Pick \[DAL\], 2021 2nd Round Pick \[CHA\]

Reasoning: The Knicks need a star. They couldn't get one during free agency, so I predict that they will be active in pursuing disgruntled players, and KAT is one of those players. Giving up one of those Dallas 1st round picks may hurt, but with the way Luka is playing, and will continue to play, it will most likely be a mid to late round selection. As for Minnesota, Randle is a solid player on a relatively fair deal, and if the front office decides to get rid of him, he is an easy player to market and trade. Both Knox and Trier are young, high potential players that could pan out well for the Wolves.

&amp;#x200B;

TRADE 3: Kings. Warriors 3 Team

WOLVES RECEIVE: D'Angelo Russell, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Jordan Poole, 2022 Top 10 Protected 1st Round Pick \[SAC\] , 2021 2nd Round Pick {MEM, from SAC}; KINGS RECEIVE: Karl-Anthony Towns; WARRIORS RECEIVE: Dewayne Dedmon, Robert Covington, Noah Vonleh, 2024 Lottery Protected 1st Round Pick \[SAC\]

Reasoning: The Kings receive an infusion of top-level talent that could help them force themselves into the playoffs; The Wolves receive D-Lo, a budding star and tradeable asset if needed, and young upcoming talent in Bogdanovic and Poole, in addition to draft capital; Warriors, while not getting the big prize of the deal, set themselves up for the near future with several serviceable veterans, which will be especially helpful next year with the return of Klay and Curry's full health",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,74206,public,self,Exploring Trades for KAT,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ehuu81/exploring_trades_for_kat/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The team is on a 7 game losing streak, missing a golden opportunity to cement themselves as a playoff team. Frustrated fans are starting to push Walton to “push the pace” and denouncing Walton’s coaching abilities based on his team’s lack of fast paced play.

Last years Kings were fast, but they took a lot of bad shots against settled defences early in the shotclock. I don’t like that kind of play, I think at that point playing “fast” is more detrimental to your team than playing “slow.” They played at a pace of 105.5, good for equal fifth in the league tied with the Lakers(also coached by Walton

Meanwhile, when I think of deadly transition teams recently, I think basically all of them were elite defensive teams: Golden State, this years Lakers.
They use their awesome defensive communication to cut off passing lanes, get blocks/steals and push in transition.

I think the Kings have potential to be a budget Lakers in transition, with Bagley quick enough to defend the perimeter and leaking out in transition more. Obviously Fox is very capable at grabbing a board and pushing the pace too, and Holmes is a very athletic big who can outrun other bigs in transition. That is reliant on an elite connected defence, which the Kings have shown at times in wins vs Dallas, Houston, OKC, Boston, Utah, Denver etc. 

Basically I want the Kings to work out their halfcourt D before pushing the pace more. I vehemently disagree that Walton’s “slow” offence(30th in the league at 99.2) is bad coaching; because I think pushing the pace is most effective with a strong halfcourt D which Walton preaches and is trying to implement. So I actually think Walton is coaching quite well. He was also playing Bagley PF before Bagley got a minor foot injury, and it was starting to work vs Minnesota with Bagley scoring 18 points in a half. 

However, the 7SOL less Suns are probably the one successful team I can think of who played fast whilst playing bad D. They played more similar to last years Kings, but Nash is a far better PnR guard than Fox, and they had a bunch of shooters whereas SacTown has Bjelica Bogdanovic and Hield only really capable of quick trigger 3s. So even they aren’t a good model for the Kings IMO. But are there any lessons for the Kings to take from 7SOL to organically increase pace without taking a bunch of bad shots?

Overall: I think for the Sacramento kings, the best way to increase their pace is by locking in on D, communicating better(which they’ve shown they can do), and using that to get steals and blocks allowing Bagley to leak out more in transition(Bagley has to play PF more for this to work). However, 30th in pace might be a bit too slow(although this will change once Fox plays more games).

&gt; **1. What is the purpose of max/super-max contracts if players are showing how disgruntled they are with 3+ years remaining on their contract? How can small market teams draft and keep their stars?**

&gt; Players have the choice to force trades and we have seen this time and time again; this has been a players league and if you are a super star you get more power in the league. PG left soon after signing a big contract, KL forced a trade out of Spurs, AD wanted out of NO. 

&gt; All these players however with the exception of PG had 1-2 years left on their contract and still got a good return value. 

&gt; So what is the purpose of large longer term contracts? Does this mean if KAT was traded today he would get a historic haul because he has 3+ years left?


&gt; **2. What is the likelihood that KAT is traded by the end of his contract or towards it's end?**

&gt; Realistically can the wolves make a deep post season run in the next 4 years? Their roster isn't really well constructed and while Wiggins is playing better or rather had a hot start can they overcome the monster of the west: Lakers, Clippers, Rockets, Jazz/Nuggets... 

&gt; I can't see them making a deep run this season or the next unless they make some big moves. However their cap space does free up after that but with Wiggins and KAT locked up and their lack of attracting FA...it will be a difficult challenge.

&gt; **3. What teams can realistically offer assets to entice the Wolves to give up on KAT?**

&gt; The warriors are certainly keeping an eye on Tows but I'm sure there are other teams willing to get pounce at the opporutnity to grab KAT...

&gt; Raptors and Celtics come into my mind...

Tell me which would be the bet idea. 

The New 24 Team Playoff
Expand the playoffs to 24 teams. The top four seeds in each conference get a bye. Seeds 5 through 12 play in a single elimination round! This will reduce tanking especially when paired with my lottery idea below (no peeking!).
The winners of the first round play the top four seeds in a best of five (down from seven – rarely are seven games needed in the first round) to increase the odds of an upset (unless we institute “Double or Nothing” – see below). I’d also suggest the top four seeds should be the three division winners and the best non-division winner. Make the divisions matter again!

The Doubler!
If you really want to bring some March Madness style excitement to the playoffs though, it’s time to consider “Double or Nothing”! Each team can pick one home game in the round to count for two wins (as long as the other team hasn’t won three games yet)! For example, if the home team wins game one, they might want to double game two so they can gain a 3-0 lead before hitting the road. Of course, if they get upset, they are down 2-1 and the underdog can double game three and end the series at 4-1!

While I’m sure some at the NBA will worry about the revenue impact from fewer playoff games, imagine what the ratings do on Doubler Nights! I actually don’t think they would be used all that often, but certainly if you’re the underdog and if you’re down two games to one, you would want to double game four to try to go up 3-2 even if it risks elimination (since if you go down 3-1 you’re in big trouble anyway). I’m sure this is too out there for the NBA to try, but I love this idea. It would make the NBA playoffs a must watch spectacle. Someone tell Adam Silver we need Double or Nothing!

Re-seed the entire playoffs by record
 We've used to see too many Clippers vs. anyone in the West first-round series, Spurs-Grizzlies showdowns and the Cavs beating up on East opponents. Travel would be an issue, yes, but if the entire playoff field was re-seeded from 1 thru 16 without regard for conferences, the matchups throughout the postseason would provide some intrigue, similar to when Major League Baseball first introduced Interleague Play and created all types of dream matchups that we never used to see.  Also, this would be an organic way for teams from separate conferences to start developing real rivalries.

Best-of-five first-round series
The most practical idea would be to bring back the best-of-five first-round format, which would add so much more suspense to the opening round of the playoffs. We get the occasional upset, but over seven games, the better team usually prevails, especially in Round 1. In a best-of-five series, Game 1 becomes paramount for the home team, and there are simply higher stakes to every game in the series.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,74194,public,self,Possible Adjustments for the NBA Playoff System.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ehrs8x/possible_adjustments_for_the_nba_playoff_system/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2. Warriors (Picking for Timberwolves)
   1. Pick: James Wiseman 
   2. Trade: To Timberwolves
      1. I 100% see the Warriors trading for a more win now player. Wiseman is very raw and would not be able to contribute on a contender. I'm not saying this because of the recent KAT rumors but i feel that if the Wolves feel that they can't upgrade and surround KAT with high level talent, trading with the Warriors for Wiseman + whatever else is pretty good. While its unlikely, i'll just leave this in for the sake of the post
3. Knicks (Picking for Detroit)
   1. Pick: LaMelo Ball
   2. Trade: To Detroit
      1. While LaMelo is the projected top PG prospect, all the prospects have significant weaknesses and i feel that with LaMelo's weaknesses its not absurd to think a team would trade down for a player they feel could be better. I can definitely see the Knicks trading down for Tyrese Hailburton, Killian Hayes, or Cole Anthony. I picked the Pistons as the trade partner due to the fact that they don't have great attendance. Going through a rebuild could hurt them financially. LaMelo is a name that will put butts in seats, even if only temporarily. It also helps that they need a new PG.

Did they try run him off the 3pt line to kill his rhythm or something. I guess they’d cut the paint off to limit Harris’ cutting ability, but I would’ve thought Harris could’ve hit a bunch of 3s on good volume vs Philly which he didn’t do.

Trade would have to take place after Jan. 15th because Harris's contract prevents him from being traded before then. 

Why OKC does this: Getting rid of Chris Paul's contract and receiving assets in return is worth it. Long-term, Harris is the better asset. Harris is in his prime, less injury-prone and a good complementary piece. Future picks are worth a ton more to Presti and the OKC front office than to Philly because of their inability to attract marquee free agents. 

Why Philly does this: Paul's contract is shorter than Harris's. They can afford to load manage CP3. It would revitalize their half-court offense without losing much defensively. Chris Paul fits much better into the 76ers by providing playmaking, shooting and strong defense at the guard position. 

Why OKC doesn't do this: Overall, OKC is spending more money over an extra year on Tobias Harris than Chris Paul. It may not be worth a future first for them to take on another year of salary. Since the Thunder are in the playoff picture right now, it may be better for them to keep Paul and remain competitive since they can't afford to be bad for a long time in OKC. 

Why Philly doesn't do this: It'll cost them a ton of money to re-sign Simmons this off-season and Harris has a $5 million trade-kicker that they'll also have to foot the bill for. Chris Paul is a very expensive asset to acquire and high-risk considering his injury history. Trading for Chris Paul increases their championship odds this year, but shrinks their contention window.

Some notable wins include the 30 point comeback vs Dallas and the win yesterday vs Boston where basically all our bigs fouled out. Despite losing Kawhi and Danny Green in the offseason, having our best player injured, and numerous other injuries, the Raptors are still a top 4 seed and only 1 game behind the Celtics.

The Celtics have missed Hayward for part of the season, but Kemba still has a healthy Jaylen Brown, Tatum, etc. Kemba is a great player and should be an All-Star but Lowry has clearly outplayed him this season.

I'm going to sort them into tiers. The order within the separate tiers is random. This week, let's do tier 1...

TIER 1: **One of the Greatest Teams Ever?**

*The Milwaukee Bucks*

**Reasons for Optimism:**

1. They're soooo good.

Let's start with this:

[https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/tiny.fcgi?id=jGgYx](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/tiny.fcgi?id=jGgYx)

Only 3 teams have posted a higher srs at this point in the season:

The 1969 Knicks, The 15-16 warriors, and the 16-17 Warriors. Of the teams in the top ten here, ***8 won the title.*** 1 lost in a close game 7 after their best defender and second best player kicked the arguable GOAT in the balls. That team, before going 3-1 up on cleveland, beat an okc team(that played 65 win basketball when healthy) with their best player coming off an mcl sprain. Before that, they were headed to a 2-2 tie in the second round with draymond running the show. Before that they won 73 games playing at a GOATish 70 win pace when healthy. The other team, led the by the player who draymond kicked in the balls, lost a razor thin conference final to a red hot 59 win magic team. Teams this good, ***usually win.*** And off course, they haven't been very healthy.

2.  They've gotten a lot better

Another way to look at this. The bucks very nearly won the title last year posting a top 20 all time srs during the rs and dominating all but 5 games of the playoffs. They got better. A lot better, Let's break it down:

Giannis has gotten a lot better. For an overall look, his PIPM has exploded from +5.5 to +8.6. His RPM has gone from +5 to +7.5. He scores more on comparable effiency, his assist rate has gone up, has orb and drb rate have gone up. His Dpipm, Drpm, to the point where they see him moving past 2 x dpoy gobert as the most impactful defender in the league. He's unlocked lopez as an interioir threat with improved interioir passing, he's improved as a shooter to the extent he can add marginal value to broken possesions, he makes faster cross court reads in transition, and he's added midrange counters like a step back, 2 and a turn around jumper. He is, by any measure, having one of the greatest regular seasons ever, and  the cast around him's gotten better. I mentioned his improved defensive impact earlier, but it's hard to say whether he's gotten better there, or he's just been given more freedom by the emergence of brook lopez as one of the league's elite rim protectors. Sterling Brown, Devincinzo have all progressed and to ice the cake, they have a ""insert really good midrange scorer"" stopper in wesley matthews. If the Bucks meet the clippers in the finals, expect ""should they have let brogdon go?"" threads to run into ""is wesley matthews their second best player?""(no, it's brook lopez.)

3.  They're the most balanced team in the league.

Balance is good. Really good. Especially for the playoffs. It helps you survive bad matchups and exploit good ones. Bucks are the most balanced team in the league, and because of that, they arguably should be favored against their worst possible matchup(who happen to be in their conference but more on that later). Disagree? Let's look at the competition:

Lakers, Really good inside, meh outside

Clippers, Really good outside, meh inside

Philly, Really good everywhere defensively, not so good offensively anywhere

Mavs, What is defense.

Rockets, What is defense.

Celtics, What are bigs?

Raptors, Is Gasol still good? Siakim plz score.

The bucks are good everywhere. The perimiter, the paint, they can do it all. And if you're worried about them leaving three point shots open, don't be, that's an rs thing(more on that later). Their lineup is tied for the best net rating in the league, they're one of the league's deepest teams, and they are the only team in the nba who could potentially be an atg playoff defense while also being one of the league's best offenses. This is the kinda thing that wins titles.

4. Home Court Helps

They're going to have home court throughout the playoffs. Role players tend to get energized by home crowds, and you can always get a few points here and there from free throw wobbles. It doesn't hurt.

**Reasons for Pessimism:**

1. Putting your eggs in one basket

In 2009, there was this guy. He had, some argue, the greatest season ever. His team, the cavs, were the worst team in the league without him. But with him, they posted the 7th best srs in nba history, won 66 games and were going to smash kobe's lakers in the final. Then came the magic. An elite ecf defense with two bigs who destroyed the cavs inside and which rode hot shooting to a 6 game cf victory. Does this sound familiar?  It shouldn't. The bucks aren't the 09 cavs. The cavs were the worst team in the league without lebron, the bucks are... alright, wthout Giannis. Consequently, the bucks are playing significantly better basketball with giannis. However, there is a big heavy defense that could cause serious problems for giannis offensively. And they're arguably the bucks most likely ecf matchup. The issue for the bucks, isn't so much, what they can do, they can do everything, but ***where*** what they do comes from. They aren't unbeatable, like the 17 warriors, because their offense relies on one guy. Take out Giannis, you've nuetralized the buck's o. Like the pre kd warriors and curry, like the pre 90 bulls and jordan, and the early lebron cavs and lebron, when one player is the heart of everything, attacking that player's weaknesses, or disrupting the link between that player and his teammates renders juggernauts ***mortal***\*\*.\*\* The good news is that, like the pre kd warriors, that mortality is only really evident on the offensive side of the floor. The Bucks CAN lose if their offense goes to shit. They can also still win. Such is the value of two way play.

2. Secondary creation, please

The bucks have improved, not by addressing their weaknesses, but doubling down on their strengths, Their defense has gotten better. Giannis has varied his passing a bit, but it pales in comparison to his improvement as a scorer. This team still runs it's everything through a less than great passer. If you're wondering what could make them invulnerable? Lillard for draft picks would do it. Won't happen, but one can dream...

3. High Volume, Okay Efficiency

Bucks make the second most threes in the league after the rockets. And like the Rockets, their effiency is average. While 3&gt;2 usually keeps their offense running, cold shooting, defenses sagging off bledsoe's 25% catch and shoot, could make for some tense series. The good news is their defense could keep them afloat. The bad news is that bricks make defense harder. Three point offense is variable, and variability isn't good when you're the better team.

&amp;#x200B;

**Worst Matchup:**

Bucks fans, here's some advice: If you're offered the choice of signing brogdon(for free) or forcing philly to swap conferences with one of the LA teams, choose the latter. The lakers can't really do anything about your shooters and the clippers can't really do anything about Giannis but Philly could trouble both. They're specially built for Giannis, by the way. Embid is arguably the best playoff rim protector not named gobert and is potentially the league's best defender come playoff time. Hoford is a top ten playoff defender and one of the league's elite rim protectors. Richardson is an elite perimiter defender and thybuile is possibly the best defensive presence coming off anyone's bench. The 6ers have less than average shooting, but they don't use it nearly as much as the bucks. Their offense isn't as good, but it's less variable, and it opens the door for an upset should Gianni's teammates go cold...

&amp;#x200B;

Lakers, Maybe?

They're not really a good matchup, but if the bucks go cold, AD and Dwight and Lebron as help could cause trouble for giannis. Lebron's also a great passer, and great passing can do wonders vs balanced defenses.

&amp;#x200B;

Raptors?

OG gives them the potential to be better defensively than they were last season(though siakim's defense has lagged with an increased load). They also have plenty of playmaking to get by the tress of Milwaukee. They just lack a hypereffecient scoring threat, and given how close their last run-in was, It'll take a lot for them to survive the drop off from kawhi to siakim. Also, this all hinges on Gasol being Gasol come the playoffs. If Gasol plays like he has during the regular season, this series, and any hopes of a Canadian repeat, becomes an afterthought.

**Best Matchup:**

Rockets. If the bucks and rockets play in the final. Expect destruction. The discount bucks ran their scheme last playoffs and once they figured it out held the rocket's offense to an atrocious orating over the last three games of the series. The reason the defense is effective is because

1. Harden lacks midrange counters.
2. Harden is far more comfortable passing left than he is right.

The bucks have the length to defend the rock's shooters and Capela/Tucker really aren't built to stop giannis, not without sacrificing their perimiter anyway, The addition of westbrook adds a new wrinkle for the rocks, but Wesley matthews is close to perfect for stopping those kinds of players. 

&amp;#x200B;

Clippers. A popular narrative arose from the ecf, Kawhi shut down Giannis, mono, a mono. Here's a more accurate one. The raptors started off giving Giannis space to drive by sagging off. Like the celtics, they got pummeled. In this context, Kawhi just lacks the lateral agility or off ball anticipation to do anything against Giannis so they didn't bother trying. Then in game three, Nurse made a switch. The gameplan went from, let Giannis drive into out wall into, lets leave the paint, send two to three perimeter players on the big G and let's funnel him into Marc Gasol. Kawhi, thanks to having extensive perimiter help, was the perfect perimiter player to funnel him into gasol. As he had help, quickness stopped mattering and he could leverage his strength to make giannis attempt dunks over the raptor's best defender(marc gasol). Kawhi, because of his strength, was the best at this funnelling, but Siakim was nearly as effecient in this role(albeit on lesser volume). The point I'm making is transferring Kawhi does not suddenly make you a good matchup for the bucks. The defense revolved around Gasol, and say what you want about zubac improving(lakers still regretting that trade i think), marc gasol he is not. The clippers do not have the personell to do anything close to what the raptors did against Giannis. And on the other side, Wesley Matthew's is probably the iggy to Kawhi's lebron. The bucks also have the length to contest shooters so really, there's no easy dubs for the clippers here. A great passer could render the bucks defense vulnerbale, but great passers, pg and kawhi are not. Upsets do happen, but you don't shut down transcendent interior scorers by relying on your wings.  If the Bucks run into the clippers in the finals, Buck fans should feel fairly good about their chances.

&amp;#x200B;

Celtics. Everything I said about the clippers applies to the celtics. They're mirror versions of each other really. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Misconceptions:**

Three Point Defense. It is true, ***that in the regular season***, the bucks leave shooters wide open. Last season the bucks were last in the league in switches. As a result, they got burned by the celtics hot shooting in game 1. Then, Bud adjusted. They started closing out on shooters and despite cold-ass shooting, the bucks dominated by forcing bricks from range and destroying the celtics on transition. The bucks can stop you from hitting threes. And when they did it vs the celtics, the series became a formality. A regular season win at the start of this season seems to have made celtics fans forget this. Rest assured, if the bucks meet the Celtics in april, Mike Budinhozer will be happy to reteach the same lesson.

&amp;#x200B;

GIANNI'S JUMPSHOT WILL CHANGE HOW DEFENSES DEFEND HIM. No no it won't. Successful defenses already guard him lik e a three point shooter becasue of the danger of his drives. Unless you're expecting him to become Curry, good defenses(well actually only two defenses(tor+phi) have the personnel to pull this off) will do exactly what they did last season. Blitz him and stop his passing lanes. If you want to seriously change how defenses defend him, he needs to pass better, improve his midrange game or have his teammates shoot better. Preferably all of those happen. If not, expect him to be defended like jordan was, except instead of clogging the paint, they'll clog the driving lanes.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,73984,public,self,[OC] RINGS ERNEH: A Holiday Guide/Analysis of the 2019-2020 title contenders Part 1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/egpimi/oc_rings_erneh_a_holiday_guideanalysis_of_the/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Warriors get a scoring 3 that can guard opposing 3's ok, which allows klay to play SG.  harris will mesh well with steph and klay in terms of the GSW motion offense.  meanwhile, D'Lo fulfills sixers need for a secondary ball handler.  having D'Lo at the 1 allows simmons to play a lebron style role at SF and as the primary ball handler.  D'Lo can shoot pretty well too, so sixers maintain their shooting ability.  

GSW would use their high draft pick to go after a center (maybe wiseman?) that will seal off their starting 5 for the next 4 years

Sitting in the final row of Cameron Indoor, I sat in a crammed section to watch the freaks how that was Zion Williamson playing basketball. 

In what was a rematch of the infamous 2002 NCAA Basketball Tournament Upset, Zion Williamson put on a clinic of incredible rim protection, transition offense and a ‘pick-up basketball two-man’ offense, he lived up to expectations. But watching his swiftness, is agility, how he physically dominated his competitors couldn’t be explained. He also looked fat. Just confirming that rumor. 

His draft value was reasonable. He had the ability to be a transcendent player in the right environment. The physical tools that couldn’t be taught, his marketability, his ability to simply play the game of basketball were all there. 

New Orleans was making an extremely easy decision when they were on the clock with the first pick in the draft. Zion Williamson would be the star to replace Anthony Davis. He would lead the new era of New Orleans.

And then…they fucked it up. Kind of. Here’s why.

Zion Williamson is a very talented player with a fairly limited game. This isn’t necessarily a terrible thing, we still remember some of the greats that excelled at a limited game. The problem is that these types of players require resources around their game—which is a tough ask, especially for a player two years removed from high school. 

The Zion dilemma is pretty interesting. Back in college, we remember his highlight reel performances, seemingly on every play he scored. When he went quiet, you could hear a pen drop in the building. In the infamous game against Louisville, where Duke stormed back thanks to heat check performances from RJ Barrett, Cam Reddish and a disappearing act from Jordan Nwora, Zion was shutdown in the first half and the mystery behind the man seemingly washed away for the moment.

People were not kidding when they said Zion’s game was built for the biggest stages. He explodes to the basket with his big frame, is extremely aggressive with his decision on the defensive end and he likes to dunk. Not necessarily an excellent perimeter defender, he enjoys being stretched across able to jump in front of a pass, even if at times, [he’ll get burned for his decision making](https://youtu.be/J5nykLPRi6M?t=22). In the half court environment, his powers can be contained. Until he can truly develop his shot from deep—which he is actively working on—teams can cheat his drive and inside game. 

It takes a while to get a freight train up to speed but when you do, it is difficult stop. It perfectly describes Zion’s ability—he needs the build-up to go at his full speed.

So when the New Orleans Pelicans built their 2019-2020 Roster, there were a lot of questions.

David Griffin and his soon-to-be hired GM Trajan Langdon entered a dream situation. Tasked with trading a player wanted by most, they brought in a haul fitting for one of the best players in the association. The talent they would bring in would be seen as the foundation for what is yet to come—a creative point guard, a potential star small-forward and a talented off-the-bench forward as well as three near-future picks and 1 potential pick-swap. 

They would complete another trade—sending off Solomill Hil and the fourth overall, 57th overall and another pick for three draft 2019 draft picks—8, 17 and 35. 

And they would lose Julius Randle , Cheick Diallo, Elfred Payton among others to the waves of the off-season.

It was an incredibly active off-season for the Pelicans. Its why the draft was so important because Griffin’s stockpile play needed to pay off. The talent drafted is good, it just didn’t make sense for the new team. 

New Orleans drafted  three players that would benefit from the two-man system, the system previously managed by Alvin Gentry, Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday. Ingram, Hart and Ball were all coming from a motion based offense and the questionable world that is ‘LeBron Ball.’ Because of the investment in talent that could shoot, Gentry made the choice to go against the newly drafted talent and go with the somewhat know, flexing the offense around the perimeter—they quietly would go from the lowest three-point attempts to most. 

The new team feels different, which it should. It sort of feels like every teen movie where two opposite cultures are forced to work together for the greater good. Immediately, we have the kid news on the block taking over and the old crowd is lost.

The media has been disappointed with Jrue Holiday. Statistically, not much has changed—its pretty incredible. He’s reflecting same amount of %FGA being 3 point shots (31.3) and %FGA being 2 point attempts (31.3), still hanging around the 20 points per game amount, with around 17.5 attempts a game. He’s still seeing a usage rate around 25% and is still accounting for about 24% of the team’s points per game. 

But we must go deeper. 

He’s begun to step away from the mid-range game and is stepping into the efficiency realm. He’s reduced his percentage of  points from mid-range by 3 points, increased his percentage of points from behind the arch by 5% and increased his percentage of points from fast break by 2%. 

Even deeper—his  turnover ratio took an interesting turn. Since making the transition to primarily being a 2-guard in 2016, this is first year year of having a 2:1 ratio on Bad pass versus lost ball turnover. In previous years, we could expect the bad pass to lost ball ratio to be around 3:1. Its been the one tell that we’re able to see, where Jrue Holiday is experiencing some sort of issues. 

Off-ball Jrue isn’t a problem—the problem has been how the line-ups exist with different builds. With Lonzo Ball in the line-up, Gentry loves to execute more motion based offense. There isn’t a coincidence that with Lonzo on the court, the Pelicans are committing more turnovers and are getting outscored despite taking an increased number of three point attempts.

Lonzo enjoys pushing the pace and has a pretty solid control of the offense. But at times, it can feel like he is attempting to push things too fast and it leads to a careless mid range jumper or a quick three point shot. His movement and spacing on the floor has been a great compliment to Jrue. But when they are on the floor together but the shots don’t fall. When Jrue leads the offense with both guards on the floor, often times Lonzo is required to make the key jumper, following the drive from Holiday and cannot hit.

The motion offense is meant to set-up Brandon Ingram as much as possible but in reality, he excels just through the concept of searching for the open shot. Because of the natural floor spacing, Ingram’s shot selection has been incredibly balanced—28.7% of his shots being catch-and shoot, 32.2% of his shots being pull-ups and 37.5% coming 10 feet or less. If the motion office was truly the key reason for why Brandon Ingram was excelling, we would see an increased number of his shots coming form the catch-and-shoot. 

Its a bit crazy how Brandon Ingram just basically creates a two-man offense when the ball is in his hands. [He loves the high screen at the top of the key](https://youtu.be/A4I-MupWq6Y?t=14) and [will basically wait for a play to develop just for someone to bring him a high screen for additional spacing](https://youtu.be/A4I-MupWq6Y?t=40). Its why he’s able to get 43% of his shoots with 4+ feet of space between him and his closest defender and is able to only have 10% of his shots be ‘tightly defended’ (less than 2 feet of space between him and the nearest defender). 

The motion offense also requires a lot more attention to detail. Every pass and dribble becomes more meaningful. [Penetrating drives that are meant to create space are now attacked a lot more to force the mistake](https://youtu.be/ENNSjUuJVzg?t=68)—similar to how you would run a blitz in the NFL. [The simple pass can be missed](https://youtu.be/8LbYjz4RieU?t=354). It makes sense why the team has a higher percentage of their points coming from the fast break versus others--their half court isn't good. Sloppy mistakes, poor decisions and the requirement of having the ball to go into the basket isn't working in their favor.

And even with the Pelicans being reliant on the long ball—averaging the 5th most 3-point attempts and hitting the 4th most three pointers a game, they still aren’t the best from the field—shooting 44.5% and average the 7th most turnovers per game. They also average the 6th lowest percentage of points in the paint (40.6%). The motion offense requires a lot to go right—its not something that can be executed by only usable talent.

Usable talent is a good phrase to describe the Pelicans. Because of the wealth of usable talent, it sometimes leads to a loss of definition. The testing period to see what talent would possibly take the next step—or the Brandon Ingram ‘Most Improved Player’ project has worked. But at what cost? 

Lonzo Ball has entered another environment where it doesn’t feel that he will fit. Jrue Holiday’s ball-handling hoes has come to fruition with how teams are able to collapse on his drive and force a turnover. JJ Redick finally has shown signs of aging. And draft talent is stuck not developing their own game—Nickel Walker-Alexander and Jaxson Hayes are receiving meaningful time but in various different roles, leading to questionable development practices.

The real future of the team will be determined when Zion comes back. Because when Zion comes back, we’ll see the missing two-man game.

Before the season, we saw glimpses of what could have been. Zion’s ability to stretch the floor, with his athleticism and handles would have opened the floor through crafty cuts to the basket or sitting at the top of the key and driving his way to the basket. More importantly, it seemed like the perfect pairing for Lonzo Ball and how the two had highlight connections on the fast break as well as executing quick possessions. 

It feels that the team is still searching for answers. *Is Brandon Ingram finally finding his form and will be able to reach his full potential?* *Is Jrue Holiday going to be the future of the team or should they sell while his stock is still towards its peak?* *How will Zion fit in a motion offense?* *Is Gentry going to return to a two-man game once shown with Anthony Davis when Zion returns?* *Can Lonzo Ball finally have a system to be just a creator?* 

All we know right now is that the team is not good and people don’t understand why the team is struggling. A team that is searching for a definition is going about it the wrong way. Their motion offense continues to get punished without the right talent. In the mean time, stockpiling usable talent is leading to misused depth and questionable managerial choices. 

If the Pelicans are expecting Zion to fix all of their problems, its possible but highly unlikely. Expecting a team that completed a 180 adjustment to make another 180 adjustment is a lot of ask. A team that currently players. A team with enough talent to function and a team where the talent is performing well individually but not as a whole needs to be able to create a vision for the future.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,73934,public,self,[OC] A Mountain-Sized Hole Cannot Be Fixed By One Player - The Concerning Status of the New Orleans Pelicans,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/egcb5l/oc_a_mountainsized_hole_cannot_be_fixed_by_one/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read the article if you want details but I will summarize the arguements

1. High Revenue markets vote against it

Basically, the biggest markets (New York, Boston, Los Angeles, Golden State, maybe Toronto) would be against this new status quo because they each make multiple millions per home game. Doing away with that would cut into their revenue. He also included a random point about how eastern markets may not want reseeding because it's more likely that two western conference teams get into the finals. This is a very important point. Knicks, Celtics, Lakers, Clippers, Raptors etc. make millions per home game in revenue (as an aside, do all franchises have about the same expenses) so they wouldn't want to give up home games.

2. Teams tank the group stage to get rest

This would be the championship contenders just rest their star players if not intentionally lose since the tournament is meaningless compared to the NBA championship. And since the championship contenders are often the teams people most want to watch, this would be damning. I think this could be reason why governors vote against this.

3. Tiebreaker hell

This arguement is that the math would be too complicated and there would be too many teams tied so tiebreakers would be ridiculous. I personally don't think this matters.

4. Boring crowds for the Final Four

The author is going with the assumption that the tournament would be in Las Vegas every year. Basically, NBA fans don't travel as well as college basketball or college football/NFL fans. Las Vegas is basically a Lakers home city. He also said that if, for example, the Bucks played the Raptors in the tournament final there wouldn't be many Bucks or Raptors fans. Speaking as someone who lives in another major city without a team that could host neutral games, he has a point. I'm in St. Louis so if the Suns played the Magic I doubt the arena gets filled. And the Bulls/Pacers/Grizzlies/Celtics would have way more fans than other teams (except being the Lakers probably). I'm sure if Montreal hosted the tournament, the Raptors would have way more fans than everyone else. 

5. No one cares

If you feel comfortable with Klay at the 3, especially on the defensive end, then keeping DLo and having him play the 2-guard position makes a lot of sense. On the other hand, if you really want to keep Klay at the 2-guard spot, you need to use some of those assets to pick up a starting-caliber 3, ideally one who fits well with the other pieces on the team, which is why you see so many trade machine things with the Warriors trying to get a guy like Robert Covington. To my mind, this whole thing really comes down to three questions that any team with championship ambition needs to answer: 

1. Who guards the ball-dominant scoring guards, such as Harden, Lillard, Kemba, etc. For the Warriors in the past, that's usually been Klay. 

2. Who guards the mismatch-nightmare wings like LeBron, PG, Kawhi, KD, Jimmy Butler, etc. I think a lot of these guys are simply too big and strong for a guy like Klay, even though he is a good defender with decent size. Obviously, GSW's other decent option there is to have Draymond play man defense, but that isn't the optimal use of his skills, which are far better-leveraged by letting him roam and be a help defender.

3.

There are some teams that I think are virtual guarantees to play on Christmas next year (barring a surprise retirement or death).

Los Angeles Lakers - Why? The most popular athlete in the anglosphere (LeBron), arguably the most popular non soccer team on Earth, Anthony Davis, most likely a title contender

Los Angeles Clippers - Why? Richest owner in sports, title contender, Kawhi Leonard

Golden State Warriors - Why? Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, championship pedigree, big market. I know they are a disappointment this year but Steph is probably the second most popular basketball player in America, he'll be scheduled for Christmas.

Brooklyn Nets - why? they play in the capital of western civilization, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, title contender It's pretty shocking that no New York team is playing this year (it's a good thing but it's still shocking). Next year that won't be the case.

Boston Celtics - historic franchise, conference title contender, big market

Milwaukee Bucks - Giannis, title contender, probably will have a deep playoff run this year.

Dallas Mavericks - Luka. That's basically the only reason. They're a good team but without him they won't have a chance at Christmas. Though it is a big market

Philadelphia 76ers - Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, conference/title contender. Big market helps.

That is eight teams, so two more are needed. I have a few contenders

Miami Heat
Why? Very solid team, place in a place players want to go in December 
Why not? No superstar players, not a huge market in terms of population
Denver Nuggets
Why? Great team, Jokic is pretty popular (not quite a superstar though)
Why Not? Small fanbase - Denver just doesn't have an NBA culture, they are virtually no fans outside of Denver
New Orleans Pelicans
Why? Zion. He's the reason they were scheduled this year. 
Why not? The NBA might be concerned about Zion's availability. Very small market. 
Houston Rockets
Why? James Harden, Westbrook, big market
Why not? They might blow it up if they don't win the west this season
Indiana Pacers
Why? Very good, solid squad. Should be an eastern conference contender
Why Not? Small market, not a large fanbase, seen as a ""boring"" team
Toronto Raptors
Why? Great organization so should be in the eastern conference hunt
Why Not? Because they play in Canada

Knicks and Bulls are theoretical options due to their market size but, unless they get a surprise free agent, they wouldn't be rewarded.

With that being said, here is my predictions

MIL at MIA - Milwaukee doesn't seem to host Christmas day games for whatever reason. I'm sure they wouldn't mind a trip to Miami in December. Throw a bone one of the faces of your league. This would most likely be on ESPN.

BOS at BKN - The Knicks used to always host Christmas games until they got so pathetic that the NBA wouldn't allow the most valuable NBA franchise in the most important city outside of East Asia to host games. The NBA will love to host in Brooklyn. Boston and New York is a rivalry older than the US itself.  This would most likely be on ABC.

PHI at DAL - Central timezone should get a game and Mark Cuban is one of the NBA's favorite owners. Luka vs Embiid would be a great way to show the international spread and appeal that the future most popular sport on Earth has. This would probably be an ABC game.

LAL at GSW - LeBron and Steph Curry. The two most popular NBA players and if Tom Brady retires, the two most popular athletes in the USA. This would certainly be an ABC game. 

NOP at LAC - You might think the Lakers would get preference over the Clippers in hosting, but with Steve Ballmer owning the Clippers, the league bows to the Clippers. I do think the league will schedule the Pelicans again because, simply put, Zion is the future American face of the league. He's incredibly popular. I think if he comes back this season, he'll have some highlight plays and people will remember that he's more popular in American than Luka or Giannis (sadly).

This post isn’t quality like many of the other post I see on here but still I think this is a interesting discussion to have. At the beginning of the season many people such as myself was saying kawhi is the best player in the league. With 2 months in the book this season most people are back to LeBron and many saying Giannis is the best player in the league. That being said should we really judge who the best player in the league is based on the regular season or should we wait till playoffs. As a raptors fan I may be biased in thinking kawhi is still the best player after his insane playoffs run last year which showed the world he is the best two way player in the game today. Making clutch shots and being a key part of the defensive system nick nurse structured around him. That being said tho kawhi hasn’t been all too impressive being hyped up this much this summer because of the run. I think simply put kawhi does not give a flying crap about the regular season he’s practically said it himself that it’s just practise. Players like LeBron and Giannis are having monster seasons and are now being crowned the best player in the league. Is this really fair tho? Seeing hot takes of Stephen a smith criticizing kawhi saying he’s not the king of LA and stuff like hay that drives me crazy. Kawhi hasn’t made a real case to bet yet but come playoff time I think it’s game over for the western conference when kawhi goes into his final form.

They say he would be an automatic title contender, that he would average 35 or 40 points a game, that no one in the modern era could guard him, etc.

Now, forget for a second that modern players are taller, bigger, more athletic, Blacker, and much more skilled than your average guy on the court in the 1960s. When Wilt was a rookie in 1960, there were literally only 3 other players over 6'8"".

Also forget for a second that the zone was specifically instituted to make life more difficult for Shaq, the player with the closest impact to Wilt in recent memory.

Also forget that Wilt played the first part of his career with a 12-foot lane, which allowed him to camp practically right next to the basket. Wilt led the league in scoring 5 out of 5 years with a 12-foot lane, and only once more in the 10 years after the lane was expanded to 16 feet.

But lets set aside for a moment that playing against bigger, stronger, better competition with zone defenses and a 16-foot lane would make life for difficult for a center who only scores close to the basket on isos. Let's, for a moment, ONLY focus on what Wilt did in his own era.

Because Wilt was never unstoppable on offense even in his own time. 


Everyone focuses on Wilt's huge regular season numbers. But in the 1960s, few teams played meaningful defense during the regular season - instead, they just ran up and down the court taking the first shot available. The average # of possessions for an NBA team was 150 at one point (now it's only 100), and even average teams scored 115 points a game despite not having a three-point line and the average player not really being able to shoot. Running up and down the court like that, no one had any energy for defense, so it wasn't played most of the time.

I don't care about Wilt's regular season stats - in that environment, they're almost meaningless. Let's take a look at what he did in the playoffs, when teams started clamping down and trying on defense (though still not anything near the effort they reached in the 1990s and beyond).

1. Wilt's 50 point per game scoring average (season)  
2. Wilt's 55 rebounds (game)  
3. Russell's 11 rings (career)  
4. Lakers 33 game win streak  
5. George McInnis 422 turnovers (season)   
6. Wilt's 100 points (game)  
7. Chicago's 72 wins (season)  
8. Skiles 30 assists (game)  
9. Rasheed's 41 technicals (season)  
10. Calderon's 98.1 free throw percentage (season)

Number 5 was broken by both Westbrook (438) and Harden (464) in 2016-17

Number 7 was broken by the Warriors in 2015-16 (73-9)

Clearly not all of these were actually unbreakable. out of the 8 remaining only 1 cannot be broken based on the rules.  Based on the current suspension rules for techs it is impossible to receive more than 36 in a season.  So barring a rule change #9 is actually impossible to beat.

Out of the remaining 7 I don't believe 4 of them will ever get broken.  #1, 2, 3, and 6. All of these were accomplished before 1970 when the game was very different. A faster pace and fewer teams then we have today. 

That leaves us with 4, 8, and 10. I believe all of these reasonably can be broken. 

The  Heat had 27 consecutive wins and the Warriors had 24 or 28 consecutive wins depending if you count the previous year or not. This all happened in the past 10 years. I don't think its impossible for a team to win just 6 more games. Who knows maybe the Bucks can win 16 more. they are currently at 18 straight. 

John Stockton had 28 Assists only 16 days after Skiles' record of 30. That is still the closest anyone has gotten, but in the past 10 years Rondo had a 23, a 24, and a 25 assist game. Westbrook also had a 24 assist game. 30 is not so far off. If a team hits a few more shots this record is breakable.

98.1% is incredible. Calderon went 151/154 from the line. As hard as this seems to beat he is a career 87.3% free throw shooter. There are players better than that. If Curry, Redick, or Lillard go on a hot streak to start a season and then get injured after hitting enough to qualify this record can be broken. 

I am not saying that any of these will be broken but I think that these last 3 all have a possibility of being broken. Who knows it may happen this year or maybe not for another 25 years.

My suggestion is is along with the cash incentives, which I feel is best proposed by Jason Concepcion of The Ringer, in the form of literal cash on the court and called the Cash Cup.   I think another effective incentive could come in the form of a one time coupon for a non tax payer MLE.  This coupon would add $10 million to a teams cap for 1 year.   It could be redeemed any year within five years from winning it but could not be combined with another coupon.  

This would give a team like the Thunder who is a fun team but not serious contenders an extra tool to make 🐍 bites not so lethal.  Or it could give a team such as Portland who has been hit by injury not to have to be killed by the tax.   Yet another type of team it could help is the “I was drunk when I signed this player” team like Philadelphia.  When they have to start signing $36 million dollar checks to Tobias Harris.  

The Coupon would give any team who thinks they will be competitive over the next 5 years an opportunity to add a quality player that does would not count towards their cap.

He also shown his improvements on the defensive end, averaging 7 RPG, 0.8 BPG, and 0.9 SPG. For a SF/PF, he is also a good passer with 3.2 APG as opposed to only a turnover and a half per game. Sure Simmons and Embiid get all the attention, but the case can be made that Harris has been the Sixers most productive and consistent player. He has taken on the role of closer in most of their close games this season, and it has paid off. The 76ers are the 5th-best team in clutch games this season, accruing a 13-7 record (.650 win percentage). He certainly is not averaging the most PPG in the clutch (just 1.7 points on average in those situations), but he makes the most of them by shooting 50% from the field.

Buddy also has a +/- of -5.38 per game over this timeframe. Averages 2.7 turnovers per game.

wo/Fox (17): MPG:36.7 Stats: 23.9/5.5/3.6/0.9/0.2 on 44/37/86 splits.

The Kings are 9-8 with Buddy and without Fox. He has an average game-score of 15.56 and an average +/- of 3.47. Over this time, he has averaged the same amount of turnovers 2.7.

Based off this, it is clear Buddy performs better without Fox which is unusual as Fox and Buddy performed well together last year. Buddy scores the ball more efficiently and on higher volume without Fox, gets to the line more, and averages more points, rebounds, assists and steals while averaging the same amount of turnovers while playing more minutes. It is honestly quite staggering the difference as he goes from being a 24/6/4 player to 16/5/2 player.

People may look to difficulty of schedule but the Kings have actually had a more difficult schedule without Fox playing teams with an average win percentage of 52.6 compared to 49.1% with Fox. Also, the Kings were even further disadvantaged over that timeframe without Fox as Bagley was out for a lot of that time as well.

I have seen around 10 Kings matches this year so I do have a pretty good idea of what is happening. Personally, Buddy doesn't handle the ball enough while Fox so I'd suggest the Kings look to run more plays through Buddy as he is much improved this year as both a ball handler and playmaker. After the Kings going down once again today for the 4th time in a row, it got me thinking. Does Buddy Hield play worse with De'Aaron Fox?

Here are the states with and without Fox.

CP3 pretty much will retire on his contract. It's about time for CP3 to pull a KG and retire with his hometown team NOP. He did all he could there, and he became Point God. It just makes too much sense for CP3 to return home after this season.

Next up, Jrue Holiday is ready to join a contender. He would love to return to the team who drafted him also and play with Embiid. So Jrue will be sent to the 76ers. Lonzo salary will get shed in this trade by trading Lonzo to OKC.

So who do the 76ers give up for Jrue? Ben Simmons. Ben Simmons poison pill contract will be tradeable this offseason. Jrue+JRich+Harris+Horford+Embiid would be title contenders for a good 4-5 years.

OKC seems to love players without jumpshots but are super athletic. Look at Andre Roberson, Jerami Grant - he developed it while at OKC, and etc. What would OKC's lineup look like?

I've always wondered why we have to wait until after the full 82 game schedule to determine who picks where in the next draft.  I think we know which teams are the bottom dwellers by game 60'ish.  That's a lot of games.  Why not determine after 65 games as opposed to 82?  There are several benefits to this scenario. First, it prevents the 'end of season' tanking that is prevalent in the NBA.  The final month of the season could be used by the bottom teams to prepare for next year as they'll know where they will be selecting in the upcoming draft regardless of how the team finishes the final 17 games.  This would give front offices and coaches a leg up on the next season as waiting on how the draft lotto falls out.  This past season the lotto selection took place May 14th.  Push that thing back to mid-March.  Figure out some way to make sure the bottom teams have more of a chance than those that barely make it into the lotto.

I realize one scenario that could happen would be a fringe team getting a lotto pick and still making the playoffs.  I'm not sure that's a bad thing.  With a month to go in the season there may be several fringe teams that figure why not go on a run since they already know where they will pick in the draft.    Other teams may chuck it in and start bringing up their prospects.  Either way, the end of the season for the bottom teams would be much better than it is currently.

He’s young and has plenty of time to improve, I’ll admit that. It seems to me, though, that people are hung up on his young age as a sign of his potential. In reality, just because he’s putting up these numbers at 21 doesn’t mean he’ll be 1.5x better once he’s 25. I would argue that Tatum has actually gotten worse as he’s progressed, sacrificing huge amounts of efficiency for decent gains in raw stats. 

**Among the 31 players who average 20+ PPG, Tatum ranks 30th in true shooting percentage (52%). The only player behind him? Russell Westbrook (51%).** Not great company. His eFG% also ranks 25th out of that group. 

Now, its an accomplishment for any player to be averaging 20 PPG at 21 years old. However, he is taking 18 shots a game. Among players taking that many shots per game, he ranks 18th out of 21 in PPG, ahead of only Buddy Hield and Jrue Holiday.

Furthermore, he’s actually regressed in his efficiency year over year. His FG% dropped from 48% to 45% and is now at 42%. 3PT% from 43% to 37% and now 35%. His TS% from 59% to 55% and now 53%. I’ll admit that he’s upped his raw numbers, which are generally inversely correlated with efficiency.

The point of these “volume scorers” like Tatum is being profiled as, is to score huge numbers of decent/above average efficiency. 

Players generally don’t take massive leaps, but rather gradual improvement over the course of their careers. It looks like Tatum would need to make massive leaps in his efficiency to be the player he’s being hyped up to be.

What do y’all think? Am I too low on Tatum? Can he improve into a superstar?

Very sad. 

And it's especially sad because at least ex-Yugoslav names are easy to read. Almost without exception, every letter is pronounced the same in every position in every word. Sometimes you need the original spelling to see the correct diacritics, but this is now standard on uniforms and is becoming increasingly common in the media.

So how to get ex-Yugoslav names right and avoid sounding like a clueless pundit? For all players from Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia, just follow this simple guide:

First, don't worry about getting it completely correct. You won't, and that's not the point, all you need is to get **the closest natural English rendition**.

Second, pronounce all the **vowels** the same as in (English approximation of) **Spanish**. If you can pronounce ""Fernandez"" and ""Rubio"", you're done. Otherwise, **putt-pet-pit-pot-put** is a good mnemonic for **a-e-i-o-u**.

Third, learn the **consonant** letters that are different from English:

* **j** (as in **J**okić) is always pronounced **y.**
* **c** (as in Bjeli**c**a or Zuba**c**) is always pronounced **ts**. It's the German **tz** sound in ""Leibni**tz**"".
* **č** and **ć** (as in Don**č**i**ć**) are two kinds of **ch**. Don't worry about the difference, it doesn't matter in English.
* **š** (as in **Š**arić) is pronounced **sh.**
* **ž** (as in **Ž**ižić) is pronouned **zh**. It's the French **j** sound in ""Bon **j**our"".
* **dž** and **Đ**/**đ**  (as in ""**Dž**anan"" or ""**Đ**or**đ**ević"") are two kinds of English **j**. Don't worry about the difference.

Fourth, the **accent** will most commonly be **on the first syllable**. There are exceptions, but they are rare enough that you should assume this to be true unless you know that a particular name is accented differently. In fact, the only current exceptions in the NBA are Bojan, Bogdan and Boban, whose long last names are accented on the second syllable (Bog·**dun**·nov·vich, Mar·**yun**·nov·vich). 

Fifth, if you're not sure how a particular name is spelled or pronounced, **ask** somebody who knows (I'll answer any questions in this thread), or look it up on Wikipedia. It's amazing to me that people who are paid to talk about sports are not doing this before attempting to pronounce any foreign name.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,73694,public,self,Don't say Luka Donkich - A short guide to pronunciation of ex-Yugoslav names,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/eerntb/dont_say_luka_donkich_a_short_guide_to/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since Carmelo Anthony has been resurrected, surprisingly the Portland Trailblazers have been better with him on the court. The question is…why? Its worth starting with what went wrong before his break.

Carmelo Anthony wasn’t bad with the Oklahoma City Thunder. He shot 42.8% from the field and had an eFG% of 50.5%. Because of the spacing of Billy Donovan’s offense, he often resorted to the catch-and-shoot game with the occasional pull-up jumper from the top of the key, not being able to work in his ability as an isolation scorer as often as he would like. With Steven Adams running high post-low post, the court spacing would be limited based off of Adams’ read on the flow of the offense. 

As his time was winding down with the team, guarding Carmelo inside the arch became a lot easier. Teams would run a soft-man that would double Carmelo as he would go back down and at times, he would take the tough shot.

He wasn’t bad on the Thunder in the regular season—we just remember the play-off series against the Utah Jazz. The series that was Donovan Mitchell’s coming out party later became the series where the world questioned if Carmelo Anthony should still be in the association. In the regular season, Carmelo Anthony did his job at being another offensive skill player for the team—they weren’t bringing him in for defense. The team would have a higher ORtg (+6.7), ORB% (+7.6), DRB% (3.3) and lower turnover% (-0.2) with Melo on the floor versus Melo off the floor.

Unfortunately, in the play-offs, team’s play different. Utah Jazz would develop the counter to Carmelo—a defensive system that would follow Carmelo when he would play for the Rockets—the 2-3 Zone. For most of the series, Carmelo’s mid-range game was limited. The adaption to the zone was to push Carmelo towards the corner—removing another key aspect in his play on the wing—and not giving Melo looks towards the post. When Carmelo couldn’t be the catch-and-shoot player needed, it made sense to remove Anthony from the game but his individual performance was only a small part in what was a terribly coached series from OKC and a beautiful display of basketball from Quin Synder. Carmelo Anthony didn’t change Russell Westbrook missing shots or Paul George’s terrible Game 2 and Game 6. But I digress. 

The stench from said series would follow Melo to Houston.

Carmelo was again, tasked with being a catch-and-shoot man. But unlike his time in Oklahoma City, he never found a grove in the Mike D’Antoni offense. When he was hot, he was hot. It would often come with how the court was being spaced. Being allowed the freedom of isolation or coming off of a screen into a shot was huge for his game. He still would not get the paint looks—due to the style from Harden and Paul—which limited his play once again and where he was able to execute from. The James Harden-Carmelo Anthony dynamic never worked. James Harden would continue to be dominant with the ball and not really give up opportunities to teammates if he felt that he had the ability to create his own shot. He only assisted on 6 of Carmelo Anthony’s shots—which is still a little bit baffling, even in the short time of Carmelo’s tenure with the team.

In his final game in a Rockets’ uniform, he would shoot 1 for 11 from the field against a Westbrook-less Thunder. The 2-3 zone would haunt him again and his time would be up. A team that was looking for a ring didn't see Carmelo as a piece in the puzzle to getting one. They still didn't get one. His good would be overshadowed by the bad and he would wait for someone to be desperate enough to see if Carmelo still had it in him.

Portland was desparate.

Terry Stotts has done a beautiful job of re-introducing Carmelo Anthony into the association. 

We know Carmelo Anthony is known to be a defensive liability but instead of still attempting to force a man defense, the Blazers used a soft-zone. He’s off-ball defense isn’t horrendous and he isn’t going to be exposed by a combine-fiend that would draw him out to the perimeter and slash to the basket on him. He is still an excellent rebounder and anything above that on defense is the cherry on top with his defensive ability.

But in reality, we only want to know about how good his offense is. In Portland, its been good in context. Again, we weren’t expecting Carmelo to come back and suddenly be prime Carmelo. But this is the veteran Carmelo Anthony we were hoping to see.

Terry Stotts deserves most of the credit. Because for the longest time, its only felt partly like Carmelo Anthony’s fault for why he wasn’t able to blossom outside of New York. Let’s start first with the half-court offense. In transition, the team naturally falls into an isolation look. With CJ, Dame and Melo all being able to work, and enjoy working in iso, it only makes sense to do so. 

When the ball is being brought up, Melo will naturally fall to the opposite side, sitting around the wing. If Melo is down the floor first, and the ball is being brought his way, he’ll fall into the low post. This is for a couple of reasons. I like to use the simple analogy of merging onto the high way. Depending on the traffic, the speed of cars in the far right lane and your personal speed, you have to react to make sure that there are no accidents. 

Proper spacing of the floor is key at the beginning of possessions for the Trailblazers. Because of their dynamic guards, and the reliance on said guards, you want to create as much space as possible for CJ and Dame to work. Even if you may have the opportunity to merge onto the highway, you don’t want to risk getting rear-ended by the dude going 70 in a 55 in the right lane—even if at the time, the space may seem available.

Melo’s spacing for the guards creates more opportunities on his end. There are times where he may run into transition early just to be able to get an early post-up and allow for the space to develop around. In this brief example, Pelicans take a look from deep, which allows Anthony to run back on the offensive end. [He immediately set-ups in the post](https://youtu.be/7AaVh6EXtqk?t=154). Because of this immediate presence, it quietly creates space for two players—Simmons who will go wing to baseline and Whiteside, who will come straight down the paint. The Pelicans are forced to foul to stop the free bucket.

 [Every player knows that if they set a screen, there is an opportunity to roll into your own shot](https://youtu.be/MuNp524AZaI?t=300). Because of the ‘stacked one side’ offense run in Portland, Melo is getting a lot more opportunities to set a meaningful screen and open up into his own game, but also with the understanding that at times, he just needs to sit around the perimeter. Its not a complex offense, its a simple yet effective one. [Pretty simple clip](https://youtu.be/cPK3CHcJWec?t=92), Portland brings up the ball and immediately—we see the stack with Skal Labissiere setting up in the paint. As CJ gives the ball to Carmelo on the wing, CJ casually moves away from the ball, Skal leaves his spot in the post and sets the stage for Melo versus Lopez. Its just so simple to realize what is happening—Melo getting a match-up he wants—and it is just so simple to give even a little bit of space for him to do his magic, even if it just leads to a jump shot. 

Another example of spatial awareness,  [CJ not taking the screen](https://youtu.be/QaBlz3wv9_Q?t=85)—with the understanding that it was Carmelo Anthony’s intention to take on Knox. Its an extremely small thing that may go unnoticed but deserves to be appreciated. It’s also a sign of team chemistry.


The system also loves for you to penetrate. We already talked a bit about how the Blazers want space for the guards to work Hassan Whiteside surprisingly does a really good job at spacing out the paint when he is on the court—so that when there is an isolation opportunity, the player can do their thing. Melo and Whiteside actually play well together when manning the front court positions. The statistics don’t show but the things that don’t show up on the stats sheet—such as screens, spacing, box-outs, presence in the post shouldn’t go unnoticed.


Probably the best thing to come from his time in Portland is that he isn’t expected to take three pointers. Only one season before he left New York, he averaged more than 6 three-pointers a game (2012-13). In OKC, he averaged 6.1. In Houston, he averaged 6.4. In Portland, he averages 4.1. Shooting 41% from beyond the arch is a general improvement in the stats but he isn’t being expected to chuck it. He’s been given the go-ahead to be the true Carmelo and work his way into a shot rather than immediately touching a ball and putting up a shot. [It doesn’t mean he still isn’t swearing while getting a rebound, gets down the court and shoots a heat check three over the probable MVP,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXghUGkB_O0) he’s just been a lot better about approaching his shot selection.

His ability to have a mid-range game again—the range where he has the most attempts (79 attempts) has been refreshing. Not being able to execute from said range as well as he used to—shooting just 34.2%—is a brutal reminder that he isn’t as fresh as he once was. However, his willingness to take the shots is forcing teams to react defensively, or how they want to approach their defensive system. 

Carmelo Anthony also struggles struggles with his finishes at the room. [His first step has been too good to not get 2 points on the scoreboard](https://youtu.be/QaBlz3wv9_Q?t=147). Because he is increasing his volume of shots at the rim (roughly +2 attempts per game compared to his time in OKC and Houston), his dip in percentages makes sense. But still, you wouldn’t want him to miss from inside the restricted area. Most of the times, it feels that instead of making a big boy bucket at the basket, he’s searching for the foul. And for he most part, he get’s them. He’s gone from taking 2.0 fouls a game to 3.5 fouls drawn per game. The drawn fouls are leading to a marginal increase in free-throw attempts but still not the amount you would be expecting to see. 

Again, the crazy thing in all of this story is that Carmelo Anthony is only seeing marginal differences in his individual statistics—outside of his three point percentage being higher on fewer attempts. The statistics don’t lie, we aren’t seeing a statistically better Carmelo or much of a different performance. We’re seeing a happy Carmelo and a happy organization.

Stotts is using Carmelo correctly. He’s hiding his weaknesses, which is all you can really ask for from a coach. Because of this, the players you’re paying to lead the team are able to do what they need to do. With Carmelo on the floor versus off the floor, Portland is producing a net +2.2 field goals made, an improved FG% (+0.036) and eFG% (+0.04), and a higher point differential (+4.3). The trio of Anthony, Lillard and McCollum are producing a net +4.6 field goals made, +0.064 FG% and a +0.074 eFG%, a whopping +11.2 points.

Despite what has been a horrendous start to the season, the Carmelo Anthony experiment was a reminder that they’re still an extremely well coached team with talent that is simply getting the injury bug.

That's an interesting start, but it neglects the fundamental problem that the tourney is supposed to fix: fan interest in December/January games.

IMO they need to offer prizes that give hope/purpose for fans of teams in the 5-12 seed range. Teams that dont have a shot at a title or a 1 pick. 

Let's say the team that wins the tournament gets an extra $15m (choose the figure idc) to spend for the next year. They can then sign another key starter or two key role players without going over the cap, or resolve bad contract situations that are holding them down. It would give a team like the Mavs this year an incredible window to build something special around its young pieces.

And I think if you seriously analyze the quality of opponent/how those teams tried to play him, the idea that putting up great box stats(which is all media members look at) makes him the warrior's best player, or a legitimate rival for lebron is pretty absurd.

I have two major issues with using these series as evidence that KD is a tier above the likes of harden, better than curry, or on the level of lebron:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **QUALITY OF DEFENSE**

People generally just post a player's stats in a series, ***but they don't post the quality of the defense they put those stats against.*** The 17 cavs were a ***bottom 10 defense***. Scoring 35 ppg is nice. 70% ts is amazing. But making definitive claims about  a player based on 5 games vs a terrible defense isn't far off crowning harden best in the world because he dropped 60 on the knicks. In 2018, the cavs were ***the second worst defense in the league***. Again, just because it happened in the finals, doesn't suddenly make it more impressive than the numerous times we've seen players light up ***historically great defenses***.  Like...

when curry hit 32 ppg on 60% ts on ***the best playoff defense since the pistons***

when Lebron(in 2017) scored 35 ppg on 63% shooting vs ***one of the greatest defenses ever.***

when Kawhi scored 34 on 64% shooting vs ***a top 5 playoff defense?***

Does competition not matter? 

I'm focusing on scoring here to skew this towards KD, but it also should be noted curry and lebron both have a much greater effect on teammate efficiency than durant does. For reference, in 2019, Durant shot 7 points worse when curry was off the floor. Taking these two final series and deciding ""KD IS BETTER WHEN IT COUNTS"" is honestly pretty ridiculous. Curry had a fantastic series vs the second best playoff defense of the 15 cavs, Lebron's destroyed the warriors atg defense from 16-18 and Kawhi was excellent against the 6ers and the -10 playoff defense and league best rs defense of the bucks.. This isn't to say KD hasn't had a great series against good defenses(16 spurs), but you shouldn't be citing numbers vs jv defenses to argue for kd's quality as a player. Especially when all the players I mentioned were the ***primary focus of the defenses they played***. And that gets us to my second big issue:

&amp;#x200B;

2. **WHO ARE THEY TRYNA STOP**

KD used to be the primary focus of defenses in the playoffs. Consequently, after his usage crossed 30, his efficiency in the rs went from 60 to roughly 55 in his okc postseasons. Good, but not great, and not best in the league level scoring. For comparison, curry and lebron were able to shoot with 60+ effiency on higher usage on comparable volume. You could chalk plenty of curry's advantage to spacing/system(though peak westbrook is one the best playmakers of all time), but that doesn't really work for lebron whose been yamming elite defenses hypereffeicnetly regardless of cast. Regardless the point is, if defenses focus in on kd, they can slow him down, just like any player in history.(yes, even lebron and jordan shot worse vs great defenses, shocking i know). So we get to the finals, playign shitty ass defenses. And who does ty lue say he's trying to stop? Not KD, but Curry. And that gets us to the second issue here. Not only was KD putting up stats on a shit defense, he was doing so, ***as a secondary threat***. Saying this makes him ""definite top x"" isn't far off crowning kyrie as a top 5 player when he goes for 50 alongslide lebron vs the hornets.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, my biggest issue in all this

   3. **THE GOAL ISN'T TO PUT UP STATS, IT'S TO WIN**

We have stats that adjust for lineups, and estimate player's effect on margin of victory, and these stats can both predict winning and winning when rosters change(iow, isolate for induvidual quality). When you're trying to say how good a player is, you ultiatemly are looking for how valuable they are to winning, no? They aren't definite rankings, but surely, if KD scoring vs the cavs proves he has best in the league level playoff value, that value should show up over larger sample sizes? Note: I AM SPECIFICALLY CITING PLAYOFF STATS, here's what the most predictive playoff impact metrics say was the most valuable player in the last 5 playoffs.

&amp;#x200B;

In case you're wondering who was leading playoff metrics before 2015, it was lebron from every season from 09-14. 08? KG.  How is KD a best in the world candidate when there's literally no data that suggests he was the best in the world? My eyetest tells me he's a great scorer in the playoffs and possibly the best midrange scorer since jordan. My eyetest tells me he was the second best iso scorer in 2019 behind Kawhi.

Philly - Donovan Mitchell
   1.   
I feel like Mitchell is the perfect fit next to Embiid and Simmons. He has the scoring ability to be their 1st option on offense along with the ability to be their closer. 
2. Lakers - Jayson Tatum
   1.   
It was close between Fox and Tatum with this pick but i think they'd lean more towards Tatum. It'll give them a stretch 4 to space the floor for Dl'o and Ingram while allowing them to flip Randle for another piece. 
3. Boston - Bam Adebayo
   1.   
His mixture of defense and passing allow him to be the perfect fit for the 2017 Boston team. Ironically the present day Celtics would kill to have a guy on the interior as good as him
4. Phoenix - DeAaron Fox
   1.   
I think this one is self explanatory. They needed a good young PG to pair with Booker and he's the best available one. The fact that he can play off ball, make plays, and play defense makes him a really good fit. 
5. Kings - Johnathan Issac
   1. While still working on his offense, Issac is an insane defender, They lose out on their franchise PG in Fox but gain someone with very high 2 way potential
6. Orlando - Lauri Markkanen
   1. Lauri actually would fit perfectly. AG, and Vuc can both stretch the floor allowing for amazing spacing while they can also cover Lauri's defensive flaws. 
7. Wolves - John Collins
   1. The only thing i dont like is the defense between KAT and Collins. They'd be a horrible front court DEFENSIVE pairing
8. Knicks - Luke Kennard
   1. Shooting Shooting Shooting. Knicks had a desperate need for shooting as the only somewhat consistent shooters at the time were Courtney Lee, KP, and Melo. Kennard is becoming a good and consistent shooter.
9. Dallas - Jarrett Allen
   1. Good scorer and good rebounder that can protect the rim. Outside of him rim protection he is a below average defender which i feel hurts his draft stock a bit. 
10. Kings - OG Anunoby 
   1. Imagine having an OG - Issac front court. That would be insane. This would give the Kings a ton of two way defensive potential for the future. 
11. Hornets - Kyle Kuzma
   1. I think he's the best win now player available for them. At this point they still have Kemba and are trying to assemble a winning team around him. 
12. Detroit - Dillon Brooks
   1. The best SG available outside of Hart. His shooting would be much needed. 
13. Jazz - Derrick White
   1. He can play both the 1 and the 2. Not Donovan Mitchell but has Solid Starter potential. 
14. Miami - Thomas Bryant

# Introduction

For years, many claimed Devin Booker puts up “empty stats.” This means his gaudy stats don’t contribute to winning. Instead, he puts up these stats due to his situation. In this case, the Suns’ lack of scoring and ball-handling puts Booker in a position to rack up stats. As soon as he got a competent coach and supporting cast, Booker started to win. With winning, this empty stats narrative faded away. What’s the difference between his stats now and then?

Not much. The main difference between Booker’s stats this year and last is efficiency. His eFG% jumped from 52.1% last year to 57.1% this year (as of December 16). Still, his counting stats stayed consistent. In fact, he’s averaging (marginally) fewer points, rebounds, and assists.

Though Booker improved since last year, his counting stats the same. Yet, he’s winning much more. The Suns sit in playoff contention despite injuries and a suspension to Deandre Ayton. Were Booker’s stats conducive to winning all along? Did he just need a good team around him to win?

Booker presents one example of this problem of how counting stats relate to wins. Naturally, better stats result in more wins because good players make good teams win. But, we have the Devin Bookers and Trae Youngs of the league racking up stats on bad teams. So, it’s hard to know how much they’re helping their team.

To combat this and give a more isolated view of player performance, we created true win shares.

***

# Methods

In a broad sense, true win shares measures how likely a team is to win given a player’s stats.

We’ll do this by creating classification models on game logs. We collected every single box score for every player in every game since the 2014-15 season. This boundary is somewhat arbitrary. 2014-15 was the Warriors’ first championship season, which in some sense marks the start of the modern NBA. Going further back isn’t necessary; there were over 87,000 box scores from 2014-15 to 2017-18.

We collected box scores from Basketball-Reference. Each box score includes a player’s basic counting stats (points, rebounds, assists, etc.) and the result of the game (a win or a loss). We’ll train models that take these basic stats and predict the result of the game.

For the models, we chose the following stats as features.

|Offense|Defense|Other|
:--|:--|:--|
|PTS|STL|Location*|
|AST|BLK|MP|
|TOV|||
|3PM|||
|FTM|||

\* Location = 1 if the player is at home, -1 if the player is away. We added this because generally, players play better and win more often at home. So, the location may help explain some of the variance.

With these features, we created 5 models:

1. Logistic classifier (LOG)
2. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA)
3. Random forest classifier (RF)
4. Gradient boosting classifier (GBC)
5. Deep neural network (DNN)

We trained each model to use the above features to predict a win or a loss. Then, we looked at the prediction probability. The above models are all classifiers, meaning they predict samples to be either (1) a win or (0) a loss. But, each prediction comes with a probability, or likelihood the team will win or lose given the stat line. This probability is what we’ll look at. This gives us our “true win shares.”

The prediction probability will be between 0 and 1. 1 indicates complete certainty that the team will win given the player’s stat line. So, the best possible cumulative true win shares is 82. For this to happen, a player must play all 82 games and the models must be 100% certain he will win each game.

We’ll look at both average and cumulative true win shares for the 2018-19 season. In every game, players from both teams put up awesome stats. So, this means we’ll rarely see high win probability given a stat line. As a result, cumulative true win shares will value durability a lot.

***

# Why true win shares isn't perfect

Because we’re constructing true win shares based on box score stats, it won’t be perfect. The goal is to make a more accessible holistic metric, so using simple box score stats is better. But, these stats will overvalue some players (like Westbrook) and undervalue others (like good defenders).

Though predicting wins for each player stat line attempts to remove the effect of their teammates, the player’s team still matters. For example, two players can make the exact same passes, but one can rack up more assists if their team hits shots. This will give the player with the better team the better score. Still, other advanced stats suffer from this too; this is unavoidable. For example, offensive win shares considers points produced.

Points produced considers the player’s points scored and the points coming off their assists and offensive rebounds. So, this will also reward players with better teammates. Without using play-by-play lineup data, it’s almost impossible to remove the effect of a player’s team. Even with lineup data, we can’t remove the effect. So, true win shares suffers from a similar problem to most stats: it fails to fully isolate players.

Another issue with basing wins off counting stats is that weird combinations of stats that aren’t “good” often result in wins. This is because external factors affect these stats. For example, we wouldn’t say that the Warriors need Stephen Curry to get a lot of rebounds to win. Yet, in games where Curry recorded at least 9 rebounds, the Warriors are 6-1.

This doesn’t mean that if the Warriors stick Curry under the basket to grab rebounds, they’ll win 85.7% of games. It means that the other team was having a bad shooting night that game. If Curry – who’s not a great rebounder – racked up rebounds, the opponent probably missed a lot of shots. This gives Curry the opportunities to get rebounds.

We can find several other examples of this, but the point stands. Using counting stats will sometimes create weird results.

***

# Model analysis

In the past, we’ve created classification models on imbalanced data sets. This means that most of the data was one class. So, measuring correct predictions wasn’t meaningful. In this case, we have a balanced data set.

We’re predicting a win or loss from a data set of every player’s stats in every game. So, our class proportions are almost equal, as each game has a winner and a loser. This means that accuracy (which measures correct predictions) is an important metric for our model’s performance.

As a preliminary view of performance, we’ll look at each model’s confusion matrix. This measures the number of correct and incorrect predictions of each type. So, for example, a predicted 1 and actual 0 is a false positive; the model predicted a win, but the game was a loss.

The graphs below show each model’s confusion matrix.

https://i.imgur.com/7zrvtJw.png

https://i.imgur.com/hT5X00r.png

We see that all the models are generally accurate; there are more correct predictions than incorrect. This is indicative of good performance here. But, this helps us visualize performance – it’s not a concrete metric.

For metrics of performance, besides accuracy, we’ll use the usual performance estimators. These are recall, precision, F1, log loss, and area under the ROC curve. For our imbalanced data sets, we cared a lot about recall and precision, which measure the ability to accurately find the positive class. With a balanced data set, no single metric is particularly important.

Here’s what all these metrics measure:

- Accuracy: total correct predictions
- Recall: how many of the positive class samples (1, a win) are returned out of all samples with the positive class
- Precision: how many of the samples that we predicted are positive are actually positive
- F1: a way to combine recall and precision (lets us compare two models if one has higher recall but lower precision)
- Log loss: like accuracy, but for prediction probabilities
- Area under the ROC curve (AUCROC): measures how well our models separate between the two classes

For each model, we’ll compare these metrics to the performance of the dummy classifier. The dummy classifier randomly assigns each sample to a class. It bases the assignment on the distribution of the training data. Because our training data has 49.8% 1s (samples where the team won), the dummy classifier will randomly predict 49.8% of the test set to win. Comparing our models to this shows us how much better they are than random.

The table below shows each model’s performance in the above metrics. The best possible value for accuracy, recall, precision, F1, and area under the ROC curve is 1 (and higher is better). Meanwhile, the best possible log loss if 0 (so lower is better).

|Model|Accuracy|Recall|Precision|F1|Log loss|AUCROC|
:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
|LOG|0.596|0.586|0.601|0.594|0.668|0.628|
|LDA|0.596|0.585|0.602|0.593|0.668|0.628|
|RF|0.593|0.606|0.595|0.6|0.668|0.627|
|GBC|0.597|0.603|0.6|0.601|0.666|0.631|
|DNN|0.597|0.581|0.604|0.592|0.667|0.631|
|Dummy|0.497|0.491|0.501|0.496|17.373|0.497|

Note that the log loss of the dummy classifier is meaningless. Log loss uses prediction probabilities, which the dummy doesn’t use. Instead, the dummy always has prediction probability 1 or 0.

The table below shows each model’s improvement over random.

|Model|Accuracy|Recall|Precision|F1|AUCROC|
:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
|LOG|19.92%|19.35%|19.96%|19.76%|26.36%|
|LDA|19.92%|19.14%|20.16%|19.56%|26.36%|
|RF|19.32%|23.42%|18.76%|20.97%|26.16%|
|GBC|20.12%|22.81%|19.76%|21.17%|26.96%|
|DNN|20.12%|18.33%|20.56%|19.35%|26.96%|

Each model has a large improvement over random of about 20% in each metric. So, the models are predictive of winning games.

As one final check, we’ll discuss overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the models “learn” the given data too well. So, they’ll have high performance on the specific data, but won’t predict new data well.

One way we avoid overfitting is by grid search. Each model has hyperparameters – things that determine how the model fits the data (like a slope in linear regression). We created a grid of possible hyperparameters for each model to search. We created a model with each possible combination of elements in the grid. Then, we chose the hyperparameters that resulted in the best accuracy when tested across different splits of the data. We performed grid search on a random 10% subset of our data. Grid search on our full data set would be slow because of its size.

Along with grid search, we’ll look at the cross-validated scores for accuracy and recall. We did k-fold cross-validation with k = 3, meaning we split the data into 3 bins. With these 3 bins, we used 1 as the testing set and the other 2 as training sets. Then, we did this cycle for every possible combination of the bins. The cross-validated scores are the average scores across each split of the bins.

As long as our cross-validated scores are close to our real scores, we’re likely not overfitting. The table below shows the cross-validated scores and confidence intervals.

|Model|CV Accuracy|95% CI|CV Recall|95% CI|
:--|--:|:--|--:|:--|
|LOG|0.596|+/- 0.008|0.602|+/- 0.002|
|LDA|0.597|+/- 0.007|0.602|+/- 0.003|
|RF|0.591|+/- 0.009|0.628|+/- 0.003|
|GBC|0.594|+/- 0.008|0.625|+/- 0.006|
|DNN|0.595|+/- 0.004|0.603|+/- 0.006|

Each model’s CV scores are either barely lower or higher than their actual scores. So, we can say with confidence that our models are likely not overfitting.

Altogether, these performance metrics indicate our models are strong. Now that we’re done analyzing the models, let’s see what they say.

# Results

To calculate true win shares for the 2018-19 season, we collected game logs for every player. We limited our data set to those who played at least half the season (41 games). We gave our models this data to predict the win probability. True win shares is the average of the prediction probabilities from the 5 models.

We’ll look at true win shares in two ways. First, we’ll look at cumulative true win shares. Durability plays a big role in cumulative true win shares, as most top players earn a similar number of true win shares per game. So, the cumulative leaders will consist of good players who also played lots of games.

Along with cumulative leaders, we’ll look at the average leaders. This is the average of the player’s true win shares in all their games. So, durability won’t play a role here.

We can think of both types of true win shares as calculating wins in a basketball vacuum. The models predict wins using individual stat lines. So, they’re saying “ignoring teammates and opponents, this player should win this many games.” Cumulative true win shares estimates how many games you’d expect to win given that player’s season in a vacuum. Average true win shares estimates the win percentage you’d expect given that player’s stats.

The Google Sheet below shows each player’s average and cumulative true win shares, along with their score in each model and their true win shares ranking.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12TKwjQBPSDj0kXleaLYGRm_9rzUtwMEV8TF6Ju3EQ_o/edit?usp=sharing

As mentioned earlier, durability impacts cumulative true win shares. Furthermore, two players can have the same average true win shares, but different ranges of true win shares. If two players average the same high number of true win shares, you might prefer the more consistent player.

To show more sensitive results, we created an interactive R Shiny app. This lets you compare the true win shares of any two players in a couple different ways. First, you can look at the distribution of true win shares, which shows some form of consistency. For example, if you compare Russell Westbrook and James Harden, you’ll see that Westbrook has a lot of games with low true win shares. So, he’s a polarizing player.

Along with the distribution of true win shares, you can look at the cumulative win shares over time. So, you can see if one player was keeping pace with another, but then got hurt, preventing him from racking up more true win shares. Finally, on the last tab, you can see each player’s individual game log and the true win shares earned for that game. The link is:

# Discussion of results

As expected, durability influences cumulative true win shares. So, it’s not exactly a top players list, as several superstars like LeBron, Curry, and Kawhi missed games. The average true win shares looks a lot like a reasonable ranking of the top players. Though no one would rank Westbrook #2, most have Harden, LeBron, Giannis, Curry, and AD among their top players.

The one top player who ranks low is Kevin Durant. This is likely because his counting stats took a hit as a result of playing with the Warriors. This sheds light on the primary issue of the model: though it tries to estimate wins, it does so exclusively through counting stats. For the most part, this gives us a good idea of performance. But, this overvalues some players (like Westbrook) and undervalues others (like Durant). Still, it’s a simple way to measure player impact game-by-game.

***

# Conclusion

NBA teams use analytics to gain an edge in finding players that will help them win. By its construction, true win shares gets to the core of this goal. This is because it’s constructed to predict whether a team will win or lose given a player stat line. Given that it uses counting stats, it has its flaws. But, these counting stats are all we have that’s publicly available on a game-by-game basis.

This post isn’t meant to attack the Rockets organization or fans. However we have worked ourselves into a corner and I need to lay it out. 

1. COACHING
There was an article that if these D’Antoni Rockets don’t win the ring this year, Mike will be likely removed from the system. This makes sense to a degree, as D’Antoni basketball functions on a style that the Rockets haven’t really been able to completely make their own, but rather simply use. With such a drastic change, D’Antoni may retire. If he doesn’t, he will be picked up by another team; he’s too good not to be.

2. TIMING
Harden has spent his rising years and prime with the Rockets, and what have they accomplished? Well this depends on what perspective you are looking at this from. As regular playoffs, they’ve done exceptionally. 2 WCF appearances and a game 7 which was one hamstring away from outing the dynasty of the greatest team ever assembled in the Golden State Warriors. But as contenders? That hamstring is the only legitimate reason they didn’t performed better that year and every year aside from that has been a sputtering of talent. Granted, they were typically faced against the powerhouse family that is GSW, but it should be noted that HOU made a strong case every time they played. Morey threw everything to make Houston get a third ring, but even the offensive phenom that is Harden is enough to take down the GSW. When the Warriors collapsed within their 72 hours of hell, the Rockets looked like finalists again: until Kawhi moved to the Clippers. This is once again a league of duos, and in a league where Lebron and AD are arguably not even the best duo in LA should give an idea of the bloodbath the West has become. Harden and Westbrook, while both phenomenal players, are going to need to be more consistent in order to keep up.

3. THROWING EVERYTHING FOR A RING
Morey has tried to do everything for a ring, including trade after trade. Houston will have its first round 1 pick in 5 years in the 2020 draft, which they will hopefully use well. But this is it. Houston has had no picks (first round) and has been running a one dimensional story for the past 5 years. And it’s not like they’re getting any younger. Houston is statistically number one in average age. They are the oldest team in the league right now. 29.8 is typically an age that fits smack middle into a player’s prime, except the Rockets are using Harden, Westbrook, and a bunch of players who are close to G League level (with some exceptions, EG, Capela, maybe Tucker). Once this team ages out, the Rockets will need to force a bunch of mediocre trades to gain a semblance of an aura of mediocrity.

WHAT CAN THEY DO?
This may not be what you want to hear and neither do I. But trades may be needed. And I’m talking about players that are beloved. I’m talking PJ Tucker, Eric Gordon, etc. Now here’s the problem with this. They won’t trade Harden because he’s a perennial MVP and I completely understand this. However Harden is a running contract that needs to be dealt with somehow, and if the Rockets want true dominating contention again, they need to circulate some better, more potential pieces around their star. 

I should acknowledge why I didn’t include Capela. Personally, I’m a believer that Capela can be the future for the Rockets and that sounds stupid right now. Capela is the only young guy on this roster who is constantly showing improvement, and he is a prime example of what the Rockets are trying to do with players like McLemore, Hartenstein, Clemons, and House. I think the fact that he’s such a typical player, rising and falling more consistently rather than spiking into stardom like his fellow draftmates Embiid and Jokic makes for a reliable player. I understand that they may trade Capela but they should understand his value and not undersell him if they do this. Youth needs to be brought back into the Rockets organization. 

Also stop trading draft picks.

But who else do you think deserves to make it in from the NBA?  I think there are three possible candidates:

[Shawn Marion](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mariosh01.html) - The Matrix

The secret sauce that let the SSOL suns actually be competitive while running only one traditional big in Stoudamire (and one who wass't great defensively either).  16 seasons in the NBA, 4 times All-Star and 2 times 3rd team All-NBA.   His only ring came in Dallas as arguably the 5th best player on an ensemble cast.  In his prime from 03-07 he put up 19-10-2 per game.  

Ultimately that's probably not enough of a CV to get into the Hall.

[Chris Webber](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/webbech01.html) - C-Webb

Good enough to be paid max money without it being an overpay, anchoring some Kings teams that were legit title contenders and just rank into the Lakers at their peak.  15 seasons, 1 times All-Star and 5 times All-NBA (one 1st in 01 over Garnett).  Never won a ring due to being on an offensive juggernaut during the NBA's scoring nadir.  In his prime from 00-02 he put up 25-10-4.

His relatively short prime being overshadowed by both Duncan and Shaq means that he probably won't get in.

[Ben Wallace](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/wallabe01.html) - Big Ben

The rare defensive superstar, Big Ben didn't get paid like a franchise player by Detroit but he was definitely their anchor.  16 seasons, 4 All-Star games, 4 DPOY awards, one ring.  During his 5 year prime he put up 8 points, 12 rebounds and 2 blocks per game.

The strength of his candidacy in the HOF really comes down to his 4 DPOY awards (Tim Duncan never won one).  That's a level of defensive dominance  which is unrivalled in the modern era.  THe counterweight to that argument is that his scoring is SO underwhelming.

I think Ben Wallace SHOULD make the HOF but I would not be surprised if he didn't due to offense being given so much more weight than defense.

Sorry if this is messy I am kind of just puking out my thoughts as fast as possible.   

The problems that I see the 76ers having is that they simply don't have enough shooting, which is leading to a lot of their players not playing optimally on the offensive end. Their talent is overlapped and making their players play sub-optimally.The paint is way too clogged, and the addition of a PG who can actually shoot will allow Embiid to thrive even more than he currently is with the same going for Tobias. 76ers are in win-now mode and since the East is relatively open they should do whatever they can to improve their team.  

As for the Thunder, even though they're going for a rebuild it's clear to me that they don't want to out right tank. However, they're winning too much in my opinion and would probably be better off losing more games to get more favorable picks, rather than being a middle of the road team. In an ideal world they would like to get rid of that CP3 contract but I sincerely doubt any team would be willing to take that on. As long as they get picks I think they'll be happy and long term contracts shouldn't be too much of an issue for them since they won't be competing anytime soon. 

Here's how I see it, Ben is currently a more valuable asset than SGA due to his size, passing, and ability to finish at the rim almost at will. In my eyes, a team that is constructed around Ben similarly to how the Bucks have designed their team around Giannis could have significant success in the future and would be a legitimate plan of attack for OKC to have. Ben is also valuable because he still has 5 years on his deal and won't be going anywhere anytime soon. 

While Ben is arguably a better player than SGA currently is, I think it's close. However, when it comes to making the team better I think that SGA would do more for the 76ers than Ben currently does. SGA is an excellent defender as well, with a huge wing span, and while he doesn't have the passing ability of Ben, he is still a competent PG. He is also tied down on a long term contract that is very team friendly. The most important point is he's able to shoot from distance, and while he's not a knock down long range shooter he is leaps better than Ben is and would help the spacing for the 76ers, allowing Embiid to take less of those uncomfortable threes and spend more time dominating in the paint. 

Since the 76ers would probably not want to do this trade straight up (I am not even sure if it would work out) they would need Gallinari who is playing really well, and is a very elite shooter for his size giving the 76ers an overwhelming offensive advantage and in my eyes making them the favorites in the east by far. To match the salaries the 76ers would have to give up Al horford who hasn't been playing too well on their team, but is still a valuable asset. I am not really sure how to feel about Al's contract, however, since Gallinari is on an expiring contract I am sure that OKC would rather get something for him rather than have him walk away for nothing. 

Since OKC is currently over the tax, to make this deal better for them they can get under the tax by adding Schroder to the trade and getting Mike Scott back. Schroder is obviously the better player but imo he's over payed and OKC shouldn't mind losing him too much if they get to be under the cap while getting more picks. 

There's no universe where the 76ers would be ok with giving up a first round pick along with Ben, and since they have an abundance of 2nd round picks in 2020 (4 of them) I think it would be fair for them to give up two of them. 

TL;DR: 
OKC acquire: Ben Simmons + Al Horford + Mike Scott + 2x 2020 2nd Round picks 

76ers acquire: SGA + Danilo Gallinari + Dennis Schröder

OKC do this because they get to go under the tax cap, get two picks to help their rebuild, and get the better young prospect on a longer term deal, while getting a professional veteran who could fit well along side Adams. As a team they get slightly worse, but their financial situation, and their future gets much better which should be their priority. 

76ers do this because they no longer have to run an incredibly clogged and awkward offense. They get much better shooting all around opening up space for Embiid to dominate and play where he naturally wants to. They still get a high potential young PG in SGA who is already very productive, with good size and good defense, while also getting Gallinari who will contribute much more than Horford currently is, helping make them the favorites in the East and potentially the entire league.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,73310,public,self,Would a Trade Built Around Ben Simmons and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Workout?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ecznns/would_a_trade_built_around_ben_simmons_and_shai/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The basics of it, for those who are unfamiliar, is that all five defenders are tasked with keeping the opposition out of the center of the halfcourt.  This means that, at times, they are actively pushing opposing players toward efficient areas of the halfcourt, like the corner and the hoop itself.  

This strategy reminded me of one of the basic strategies of chess which places a high value on the center of the board for the potential 360 degree attack it can enable when it is under your control.  This, in turn, made me wonder if focusing on the center of the halfcourt on offense could actually ""break"" modern NBA defenses.     

Of course, you wouldn't want to focus on scoring from the center of the halfcourt, as it is one of the lesser-efficient areas in such a situation.  But passing from there would likely be a very good vantage point for hitting guys in a variety of places very quickly, including the corner or the hoop.  There is also the added bonus of drawing attention away from the perimeter and the hoop with your playmaker, stretching the defense even more.  Perhaps this is what made Tech's defense so good last year?  Most NBA defenses are focusing heavily on running guys off the perimeter and rim protection.  What about keeping elite passers out of the ideal passing spots?  

Of course, a lot of people would argue for the playmaker operating behind all four other players so they can have them in their line of sight better.  Operating from the center of a halfcourt offense, likely around the free-throw line, would probably leave one of the perimeter offensive players out of the sight of the playmaker a decent amount of the time.  I haven't done any type of heavy research into this, but I would be curious to see tracking data for teams that operate in the center of their halfcourt offense with their playmakers disproportionately more than other teams, as well as the thoughts of people on this sub who have more experience with the game than myself.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,73242,public,self,Questioning the value in placing elite passers at the physical center of a halfcourt offense.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ech6vl/questioning_the_value_in_placing_elite_passers_at/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SAS has had a hate on for the Raptors since he got stuck at customs in last year's playoffs ([memorably saying that he never wants to see a Canadian NBA Champion again](https://www.bardown.com/raptors-fans-canadians-will-be-very-upset-with-stephen-a-smith-s-latest-raptors-take-1.1331929)), and is certainly prone to having some terrible takes (he has repeatedly spoken in support of Scott Mills and Steve Perry's front office skills, [ranted about Phil Jackson taking Porzingis over ""NBA ready"" players like Willie Cauley Stein and Justise Winslow and Stanley Johnson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4MEj1cTVLY) and [had this memorable rant about how De'Andre Ayton was the no doubt pick over Luka Doncic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fMHvgAQuAI)), but this strikes me as a Ryan Hollins level hot take. I am not saying that the Lakers wouldn't have a shot, or that the Raptors would have been guaranteed a title this year, with Kawhi, but, to me, the Raptors would be the prohibitive favourites to repeat.

From the Raptors' side, their main guys this year have mostly all seen improvement over last year. Siakam is the big ticket item, but Fred VanVleet has also played at near all-star levels (18ppg, 7apg, 3.8rpg, 1.2stl, with great defence), OG Anunoby (who missed last year's title run with an appendix issue) has been a defensive beast while improving on offence, and Norm Powell is starting to look like a starting caliber shooting guard (he's up by 6 ppg, from 8.6 to 14.6, while improving his FG%). The Raps added a couple of useful pieces in the offseason like Terence Davis and Rondae Hollis Jefferson (they were not acquired with cap space, so resigning Kawhi would not have stopped them from making those moves). It is also likely that if Kawhi had re-signed Danny Green would have also (he has as much as said that he was waiting for Kawhi's decision to see if they were going to run it back).

There is an argument to be made that the Raps' young guys wouldn't have progressed the same way if Kawhi had still been around, as they would have had less touches, but the way that Kawhi load manages (he has missed 8 games so far), I don't think that would have been too much of an issue. 

So, overall, you have a Raptors team which is still a contender, at 18-8, with some strong wins this year (ie. Lakers, Sixers, etc), with a defence which has shut down some of the league's best players (ie. Embiid's 0-fer, Lillard's 9 point performance, etc), and you add Kawhi, and maybe Danny Green to that. The Raptors would have improved continuity by keeping the same crew together, while Nick Nurse has also improved as a head coach in his second year on the job. I think that team would have been considered a prohibitive favourite.

The main team that SAS mentioned which caused his freakout on the issue was the Lakers (although, he also mentioned some absurd concept of the Clippers with Paul George and some other superstar, but I have no idea how he thought that was going to happen). Obviously, the Lakers have been excellent this year, but would they really be favoured against the Raptors, with Kawhi, in a 7 game series?

Let's ignore the fact that the Lakers probably don't get Danny Green if Kawhi signs in Toronto, and just assume the current Lakers team against the current Raps with Kawhi. So far this season, the Lakers only have four losses, but one of them was to the Clippers with Kawhi (with no PG), and another was to the Kawhi-less Raptors (minus Lowry and Ibaka). LeBron used to be the Raptors' personal boogeyman, but that is no longer an issue. The Raptors have, arguably, the best wing defence in the league, and Kawhi is a certified LeBron stopper, from his days in San Antonio. Without Kawhi, the Raps held LeBron to 13 points on 5-15 in their meeting this year. They also beat up on LeBron twice last year. James is still a threat, no doubt, but he is no longer in the Raptors' head. Kawhi, OG Anunoby, Rondae Hollis Jefferson, etc, give the Raptors plenty of elite, strong wing defenders to use against LeBron.

AD is, of course, a real threat to any team, as well, but the Raptors also have elite interior defence, with Gasol, Ibaka and Siakam. AD would get his points, as would LeBron, but neither would be able to dominate against the Raptors' defence. This would be a huge problem for the Lakers.

The Lakers are a star-driven team. They need LeBron and/or AD to go-off in order to beat teams, because they are a thin team. They have some solid supporting guys, but those guys largely feed off LeBron and AD, and they don't have anyone who can take over a game if LeBron and AD get contained. LeBron and AD probably get the slight edge against Kawhi and Siakam as a duo in a playoff series, but beyond that, the Raptors would have a huge depth edge against the Lakers. Beyond the top 2, the Lakers have Kyle Kuzma as their next leading scorer, followed by Avery Bradley, KCP and Danny Green. Kuzma is the only Laker averaging double digits in scoring (at 11.1ppg), aside from their big 2. The Raptors, minus Kawhi, have 6 guys averaging double digits (Siakam, Lowry, FVV, Powell, Ibaka and OG). Meanwhile, all the Raptors rotation guys can defend and can shoot the three, and guys like Lowry, FVV, Powell, etc, have shown the ability to take over a game in the playoffs, when needed.

Overall, I think that the Raptors, with Kawhi, would run over the Lakers in a 7 game series, in 5 or 6 games. Playoff LeBron can steal some games, but playoff Kawhi is just as devastating (maybe moreso, considering that he is in the heart of his prime, while LeBron is not). Meanwhile AD is not playoff proven, while most of the Raptors' top guys are all wearing fresh rings. I also don't see any other team in the league which would give the Raptors, with Kawhi, a legitimate challenge. The Clippers are a favourite right now, but with Kawhi on the Raptors they wouldn't be a factor. The Bucks lost to the Raptors last year, and lost Brogdon since then. The Sixers pushed the Raptors to the limit last year, but lost Jimmy Butler and JJ Reddick.

I will be honest, the Raptors are my team, so I may have a little bit of homer bias here, but it seems to me that, when you break it down, the Raptors, if Kawhi had stayed, would have been the prohibitive favourites to repeat as champs. Does anyone feel that the Lakers would be favoured over the Raptors?

All stats are from BBall Ref, or NBA.com (I couldn't find DRTG On/Off on BBall Ref so I had to resort to NBA.com).

I am not making this post to absolve him of his lack of defensive ability, but it's been a common thread in NBA circles (at least here on Reddit) that Trae's struggles on the defensive end are one of the biggest, if not the main, reason why the Hawks are unable to compete. 

To put it lightly, the Hawks as a team are allergic to defense, but no one get singled out more than Trae Young. Cam Reddish and DeAndre Hunter have been fine for rookies, but currently the only players on the team with a non-negative DBPM include:

* DeAndre Bembry (0.9)
* John Collins* (0.6)
* Evan Turner (0.1)
* Damian Jones (0.0)

Of course Collins has only played 5 games, so the only two players of that group getting meaningful minutes are Turner and Bembry. So not exactly a stacked defensive team to start with. 

So let's move to Trae and his defense (WARNING: for those faint of heart, please look away. It's not pretty).

Currently, Trae is sitting at a DBPM of -3.2. The On/Off DRTG numbers are not kind to Trae either:

* Hawks DRTG w/ Young on: 117.3
* Hawks DRTG w/ Young off: 103.1 

This is one of the biggest arguments against Trae that pops up over and over again, but it's hardly the right way to look at his worth to the team. We all know how great he is on offense, and how much of that load he has to carry. What the stat-gazers won't see is how abysmal the offense is without Young on the court. 

* ORTG w/ Young on: 110.4
* ORTG w/ Young off: 94.3

I'm not sure there is a bigger disparity currently in the league for when a player leaves the court, and even still, watching the games, the numbers seem like they should be worse when he goes to the bench. The Hawks go from being a top 15 offensive team in the league to far and away the worst team in the league offensively. I can't count how many times I've seen him go to the bench and offensively this team just disappears. It was hard not having Huerter who is arguable the next best ball handler/facilitator on the team, but now that he's back, we still haven't seen our team with Trae sitting do much on offense. To make things worse, I'm not sure how much it will get better when Collins returns to the lineup in a few games. While he will take more attention off Trae on screen and rolls and he can shoot respectably from 3, I don't trust anyone on this team not named Trae Young to be able to get him the ball at the right place and time. 

While Trae has a loooong way to go as far as defensive ability goes, he doesn't even have the pieces around him currently to hide on that end, depending on rookies to guard wings and bigger/more explosive guards and the incredible center tandem of Alex Len, Damian Jones, and (sometimes) Bruno Fernando defending the paint. With the amount of offensive load he has to carry each night it is hard to expect him to put clamps on other guards (as much as he physically can). While he definitely hurts the Hawks on that end of the floor, it does not outweigh his contributions to the team offensively, and it shows every time he sits.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,73231,public,self,"Trae Young's Defense, while horrible, is still overblown.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ecepui/trae_youngs_defense_while_horrible_is_still/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It got me thinking, who would win in a battle of Howard vs Davis in their prime? 

In order to keep this somewhat fair, we have to assume a few things (I think). 

Both of them are facing off in their absolute prime. 

I understand AD's offensive arsenal is beyond anything Howard ever accomplished with a sweet jump shot, but I think that speaks to the times rather than their capabilities. Seeing as Orlando was built with a system of an old-school type big down low with shooters all around. But for this sake, let's assume that we have a game of 2 separate scenarios. First to 11 wins. 

Game 1 -Down Low

Game 2- Free Style

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of things to consider (which I considered). AD is no scrub on the defensive end, we all know that on this Reddit. But often people forget, apart from being one of the best help defenders, Dwight Howard was a great on-ball defender as well. So even though AD might get his from the outside, it's not going to be easy.  I personally think Howard eats AD in the pain, due to the sheer power alone.  This guy was tossing centers around like a rag doll back in the day. 

&amp;#x200B;

I might be missing a few things to consider but I would love your opinion on it. How do you think this matchup fares?

If Philly struggles again this season with their extremely odd structured team, there’s got to be a real chance they shake things up.

They won’t trade Embiid. Tobias Harris and Horford are going to be virtually untradeable (look at those contracts...) and they just don’t have the pieces to make a trade to bolster this roster....except for Ben.

It might not be super likely, but it really does feel like Philly might have to shake things up in a big way.

So say they shop Simmons, there’ll be a lot of suitors out there. I’d except the likes of MIA, DAL, TOR, PHO, MIN, SAS, NYK, and so many more to be after him. 

Here’s my wild card trade scenario 

GSW acquire Ben Simmons 
PHI acquires D-Lo, Eric Paschall, GS 2020 1st Rounder (which will be a top 5 pick), and maybe another 1st.

Golden State does this trade for obvious reasons - time to get back into the title mix. First off, imagine how unstoppable an attack where Ben Simmons is handling the ball and he can kick it out to Steph or Klay...that defense with Ben, Klay, and Dray would be one of the top in the league. Ben can continue to work on his jumper but be surrounded by champions. 

Philly does this trade to get the scoring and very capable shooter in D-Lo who can spread the floor on a team that desperately needs it. Paschall is a great young role player, and that top 5 pick could very well be Lamelo, Wiseman, Cole Anthony, etc. Philly could use those three collectively to build around Embiid and surround him with the talent around him to succeed. That rookie and other pieces on the team could be used to go out and get another guy like a Beal, Jrue Holiday, etc to give them that extra star they may need. I think this trade ultimately makes Philly a better team and gives them more flexibility with how they can build their team.

**SETTING:** Rucker Park

**CONTEXT:** The 5 players in the top row are on a team. The next 10 players in the two rows below are in a pool, from which you can mix and match a team of 5 out of. The top row team is undefeated at Rucker's for 16 years. These new challengers to the park want to end this dynasty.

Their respective PG through C connotations are listed in the order of their true position and subsequent skills. For example, the first player in the table is the only listed true PG out of the total 15 players, but SG/PG can functionally serve as a PG, and everyone with a PG connotation has ball handling skills and playmaking abilities. The only pure SG in the table--on the bottom row--, in contrast, you can expect to only fill a SG role. Also, a SG/PG/SF, for example, now becomes a competent SF in addition. And so on and so forth for all the provided combinations listed.

Being that House rules, no blood, no foul. Players are responsible for their own calls. So, for the purpose of the exercise, any stat FT related is useless. What isn't useless, however!!!!! and here's the tricky to quantify part, the percentage typed after the player's weight is their respective adjusted-to-no-foul-call field goal percentage, and the lower end of the PTS range is what you would expect them to average in this game without foul calls. But again, this is just a range, and are definitely able to go up to the upper end of the PTS range, if not exceed it during a particularly special moment--as well as dip below their range, if only during a particularly debilitating performance.

**SETTING 2:** NBA Finals series

**CONTEXT:** The team in the first row has won 10 straight championships, and are looking to match Bill's record 11 championships. If you notice, their finals averages see 3/5 of the teammates playing under 40 mins. That's just cause they usually don't need to play extended minutes, though each has conditioning enabling them to play 48mins if necessary. Also notice that the top team usually acquires their points through 95 possessions throughout a game--generally the amount of possessions you would expect a team to have during a game. They also seem to get 93 board. Even though a 5 man squad made up of chosen dudes from the bottom two rows may appear to put up more points or bring down more rebounds, note the amount of possessions each individual player needs in order to do so. You need at least 1 PG, 1 SG, 1 SF, 1 PF, and 1 C.  ""+"" connotes defensive ability, with +++++ being lockdown at each respective position and + being weak sauce.

Players are getting busted a bit more frequently in the last few years (John Collins, Wilson Chandler, and Deandre Ayton). 

I’m of the belief that the majority of players are using supplements or drugs that we would consider PEDs. I’m sure there are guys who are for the most part “all-natural” (Kevin Durant comes to mind) but the majority of guys are either taking some gear to enhance their recovery times and physical abilities on the court. 

Personally, I don’t really care if it comes out that these guys have been doping for years on end. But I’m more so just really curious about guys like Lebron, Melo, etc. and even guys from the past that we’re obviously juicing like Alonzo and Karl Malone. 

What are you guys’ thoughts on this and do you think it matters? Would finding out that Lebron has used HGH for most of his career diminish his accomplishments (Messi has publically admitted to using HGH as a youth and had relatively little backlash over it)?

The way he's playing now is so crucial to Miami's success. The common narrative is that he's the Draymond Green of his team, but I feel like that undermines his athleticism. This guy can RUN. His playmaking ability is also superb, and he is almost always the ""pivot"" player on this team, and his AST% is third highest after Jimmy Butler (and Goran Dragic, who is the key playmaker of the second unit), who naturally brings the ball up the court and the ball still ends up in his hands on most fastbreaks.

Defensively, he's versatile enough to defend under the rim and around, taking up defensive duties similar to Chris Bosh during his Miami Days. The areas where he's improved are enough to make him my pick form Most Improved. Even with Jimmy Butler coming in, he has been able to increase his skillset, even with his usage right still being under 20%, showing his efficiency with the ball in his hands.

The other candidate I've heard a lot of buzz for is Devonte' Graham, but he's a sophomore who had very limited ball handling with Kemba last year.

I am of the mindset that James Harden should have at least 2-3 MVP’s. Starting with 2014-2015: at the time the reasoning was Steph Curry was the best player on the best team. 
Fast forward to 2016-2017 and Russell Westbrook wins the MVP in historic fashion while his overall team performance was lackluster. KD’s loss was more than visible yet, the storyline won him the MVP. 

Harden rarely has a storyline working in his favor but, going back to 2014-2015 Harden not only led the League in win shares (16.4) he also averaged (27.4/5.7/7.0). Compare that to Curry’s still very impressive win share total (15.7) to go along with (23.8/7.7/4.3). 
Set aside the Stats Curry was on a young energetic lethal Warriors team. Harden was creating an energetic atmosphere in Houston before our eyes with breathtaking solo performances. My eye test also would go to James Harden. 

Now looking at this past season...which in my opinion was the true tragedy Harden’s win shares (15.2) compared to Giannis (14.4) going deeper into the stats Harden averaged (36.1/6.6/7.5) now let’s look at Giannis (27.7/12.5/5.9).  
Wether James Harden really should have won the MVP that’s up in the air. My point is there is enough evidence to see an NBA awards prejudice against James Harden. Even in this current season Harden averaged 47 points for a week (while scoring 60 in 3 quarters) and the league gave the award to Melo. 

I truly think there is now a Harden Rule, once players find a way to be bigger than the league in a sense (I.e LeBron, MJ and Shaq) the league forgets about how truly valuable and dominant those guys are. Mostly due to truly inflated expectations, Harden is now one of those players. 
His ability to get to the line is his unstoppable move much like Kareems sky hook.

Luka Doncic in his 2nd season has an all star by his side, amazing supporting cast which just beat the bucks 18 game win streak and Rick Carlisle as a coach. FYI Dallas has a HIGHER net rating when Luka is off the floor. 

While all through Booker’s career he’s had a different roster and almost a different coach each year but he still put up amazing numbers yet since everything else around him was terrible it wouldn’t translate to wins. 

Devin booker dropped 70 points on a top 3 defence in the Celtics and it was just his 2nd season. I don’t want to hear he was being fed because 70 is 70 the amount of skill/ability and hooping talent you need for that is insane. 

Right as Booker received a competent team around him his efficiency numbers skyrocketed as he is shooting 50/40/90 and is in contention for a playoff spot while started averaging 25 PPG on that efficiency and still maintaining his play making ability.

In terms of individual players, Devin Booker has more of an offensive arsenal than Luka, he’s more versatile on the offensive end. He can play make really well too, averaging approximately 7 assists in his 4th season. Booker’s career stats are better discounting his rookie year where his minutes were not great and Doncic sample size is very small compared to bookers.
 
I believe Luka has a lot of skill but his ability gets glorified and halo’d by his team coaching which fans tend to miss and Devin Booker has consistently been showing his skill/talent/ability this whole time but it would get downplayed because of the environment around him and as soon as it became just a little bit closer to being ideal he started to flourish even more.

For example, the first place team, fourth place team, seventh place team, tenth place team and so on goes to Tournament A. The second place team, fifth place team, eighth place team and so on goes to Tournament B. The third place team, sixth place team, ninth place team and so one goes to Tournament C.

The three pointer is the king of the NBA. Not only is the shot itself more efficient than one a couple steps in, but the spacing provided by the threat of an open shot is the grease to a modern NBA offense's firepower. Defenses are forced to respect the deep ball, requiring wing defenders to cover an insane amount of ground and leaving the paint vulnerable to attack. Bigs have perhaps been affected most in the new era, with shooting skill valued at a premium and new defensive responsibilities resulting in the death of the traditional slow-footed center and an increase in rangy, undersized fives. The recent shift in offensive philosophy to a trigger-happy approach has resulted in an explosion of offensive efficiency, both from the three-point line and at the rim.

However, lost in the three-point craze is the fact that not everyone is a knockdown shooter. Sometimes, it may be more effective for a defense to concede a decent look from deep if it means that they can focus on locking down the paint or putting pressure on the ballhandler. In other words, an open three isn't necessarily a desirable offensive outcome if the shooter is below average.

So from the defense's perspective, if they can somehow get poor shooters to let it fly, they can consider that a successful possession. With that idea in mind, I wanted to look into which teams allowed the most threes from below average shooters, and whether this strategy could be incorporated into a successful defensive approach. The Milwaukee Bucks of last season under Coach Budenholzer executed this strategy with great success, as [Ben Falk had noted](https://cleaningtheglass.com/bucking-the-trend-follow-up/) and my research had suggested. The Bucks return this season with mostly the same roster and the same style. However, a big change in personnel stemming from the loss of Malcolm Brogdon, with his replacements being an aging Wes Matthews and an aged Kyle Korver, could make this defensive approach less feasible.

# Method

I categorized each player according to their three point volume and accuracy so far this season. Then I went into box score data and, for each team, averaged their total three pointers allowed per game grouped by category. Finally I plotted this data, separating below average shooters from above average shooters. I also threw in the same data separated by position.

# Here are the results:

* [By Accuracy](https://i.imgur.com/oZcHhTk.png)
* [By Volume](https://i.imgur.com/tsrEsb6.png)
* [By Position](https://i.imgur.com/FKmbwrb.png) (Big vs. Guard/Wing)

# Some thoughts:

* It's interesting to see the contrasting styles of good defensive teams. Milwaukee and Toronto both give up a ton of threes overall but rank 1st and 2nd respectively in defensive efficiency. The Sixers, on the other hand, limit threes better than any other team in the league, and rank 4th.
* Conceding three point attempts to low volume or low accuracy shooters could be a good indicator of an effective defense. The Orlando Magic appear to have executed this strategy of selective threes to the best effect thus far, leading the league in allowing three point attempts to low volume shooters and 2nd in preventing high volume shooter attempts. Their defense is ranked 12th.
* As for the Bucks, their strategy (and/or execution) has changed a bit - they remain at the top of the league in opponent three pointers attempted, but have given up a higher proportion of threes to better shooters. This could be the result of a personnel shift, with Wes Matthews and Kyle Korver largely replacing the gap left behind by Malcolm Brogdon, a sacrifice in length and youth leading them to double down on rim protection. Although their style may have shifted, their results have not - they rank 1st in the league in defensive efficiency.

In 2018, Collin Sexton. draped in a crimson and black dinner jacket, displayed a radiant smile as he went 8th overall and was prepared to feast on the media attention. He would call for LeBron James to return to Cleveland—LeBron wouldn’t—and begin his journey to rebirth a Cleveland organization, similar to what Kyrie Irving was able to do. We’re still out on that.

In 2019, Darius Garland donned a neutral beige kimono. He was poised, displayed a mere smirk as Adam Silver called his name and quietly rose to the stage. Mariah Taylor would ask for Garland to comment on who he was as a player, a friendly reminder of Garland’s injury halting his college career. His father would emerge, supporting his son and oozing a charisma similar to a father talking about their child at a high school graduation party.

Two completely different point guards were about to work under the same roof. Two completely different points guards were about to tasked with leading the possible rebuild of a ransacked organizations. Two completely different guards would find themselves stuck in a media battle of which would be better. And surprisingly, they could still work together as a team.

Prior to the 2019 draft, there was theory-crafting as to what the Cleveland Cavaliers would need. Some provided concerns over what Sexton could provide as the lead point guard. While aggressive in nature and a pace setter, it could often times be seen a recklessness. Yet he wasn’t a bad point guard, everyone just wanted him to be one. 

The team would not perform in 2018-19. Kevin Love, seen as a key component in a rebuild of the franchise, would miss a significant amount of games. Despite being a beloved figure, Cedi Osman’s marginal improvement was still only marginal. A cesspool of wingmen would come and go through the line-up but nothing would truly stick. And a team that would have 27 players play minutes on the professional stage would be a mess.

Was Garland meant to be the savior? Probably not. But it did feel like there was a purpose in bringing him in, rather than just a ‘best available’ decision. That purpose was saving Collin Sexton.

A team that LeBron couldn’t even carry was place into the hands of a raw but talented prospect. Unlike the time when Kyrie Irving entered a similar path, Collin Sexton would play out the season. Sexton did not miss a game in his rookie year and averaged 30 minutes a night, working with little-to-no skill players. And unfortunately, the missing Kevin Love removed a key piece to what Sexton would be able to accomplish with the limited resources.

The Kevin Love piece opened up the floor for the Cave offense. What made him such a valuable piece coming from Minnesota was his ability to be available around the perimeter and getting the boards. Love’ provided options as to what he could do following a screen, something that hasn’t been offered by any other big man on the Cleveland Cavilers. The duo would generate more three point opportunities (+4.8) and rebounds (+1.4) while on the court together in 2018-19. 

Love’s exit left open a lot of questions in the offense and with Tyronn Lue’s early departure, it never was answered. Larry Nance and Tristan Thompson game didn’t open the court up the same way. Instead, the game became reliant on the drive and isolation—which you usually don’t want to associate with a team that has a front court and a backcourt with two different styles. The backcourt is comfortable with opening up from behind the arch, the front court wants a traditional paint game.

Sexton would attempt to balance the best of both worlds but wouldn’t be able to turn his efforts into wins. As he still attempted to develop his three point shot, his team was a revolving door for backcourt talent to mesh with him—like a person that would continue to be set-up on blind dates while not wanting a relationship.

The man that appeared to work best with Sexton was Jordan Clarkson. Statistically, there wasn’t much to shown for it other than a reduction in the point differential, a reduction in net differences against opponents. But visually, a couple of things could be noted.

The two guards spaced the backcourt fairly well, as if there was a pole between them. As one drives, the other rotates around the perimeter. Clarkson’s ability and confidence to shoot from range is still a development point for Sexton however it is still a complimentary aspect to the style of Sexton. But probably the most important thing about having both on the court is that the two provide a ‘spark plug’ atmosphere with their hustle and willingness to go for the big play. Clarkson would still chuck the ball but at least he was trying.

Bringing it all the way back to the draft, Darius Garland was meant to provide the same style of play from Clarkson but be better. Like Sexton, Darius’s calm yet bullish presence on the quarter was a welcomed addition to a roster seeking motivation. With Kevin Love returning, Cedi Osman still providing meaningful minutes in the three and Tristan Thompson not cheating on a Kardashian, it looked like the Cavs would have a better time this year, with the understanding that this team would still be bad and still be a work in progress.

It was a surprise that it was this bad. 

Poor performance brings up a lot of questions, most of which I won’t be touching on. Because again, I just want to focus on the backcourt. But it is worth commenting on some of the factors at play. 

First, veteran members of the Cavs still don’t like Collin Sexton. The infamous altercation that was caught on camera last week with Thompson and coach John Beilein was in regards to Sexton’s shot selection. The young guard was also receiving heat in his rookie year for ‘not knowing how to play.’ Bringing on a college coach to deal with a toxic locker room isn’t going to go great. And with Beilein still adapting to the NBA game, still adapting to player tendencies, we may be in for another public display of anger. Beilein also hasn’t answered the different style of plays from his two halves of the court. And while it is mostly talent based, it shouldn’t be forgotten that there is still this gap in how the game should be played.

The questions regarding Kevin Love’s status with the team going still creates some angst. With how well guards play with Kevin Love’s style, it would be a shame for the forward to move on, even if for the better of his career. 

And finally, Garland and Sexton are still developing. They aren’t two current all-stars stuck in a bad spot, they’re two raw, talented players that have failed to be coached and molded into leaders of a franchise.

With that being said, there is still the discussion of what to do with them.

Garland has a lot of question marks. Back in college, you could see the skills he had. A solid jump shot, excellent handles and a soft finish at the rim. He wasn’t necessarily the creator type but had could be developed into one. given the minute and the directions. [He could sneak a bounce pass to a backdoor cut](https://youtu.be/zlmbOGYAUDU?t=28) and you wouldn’t realize he even had that thought on his radar. At times, [he can have a brilliant high finish to avoid the defender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYCugPMpFbU) or [he could could just make the extra pass and be a good teammate.](https://youtu.be/uYCugPMpFbU?t=104)

The one that he needs to improve on his pull-up game. It makes for 43.7% of his shots and he’s shooting 36.1% from the field. Fans of his in college know he’s either a drive or catch-and-shoot type of guy, but with his handles and ability to create space, you would hope that he can improve on that front.

He also has to be better about being aggressive in transition. One of his biggest flaws is how he will slow-up to read the court, thereby allowing the transition defense to catch-up. [Here’s an example](https://youtu.be/BEHMRXBFflY?t=52): the Cavs are able to secure the rebound and have the ability to run a 4-on-3 transition period. Garland doesn’t immediately break out and now it slowly becomes a 4-on-4. Even with that in mind, he still has two options: look at the opportunity for the alley-oop or hit his streaker going down the corner. Instead, he pulls up—suddenly that momentum is stopped and his two options ease up. Lonnie Walker—seeing this—makes the smart move to assist on the drive and Garland panics. He commits to a drive and gets swatted. 

At times, you want the patience from your point guard. Other times, you want a little bit of reckless.

Collin Sexton is not for everyone but he is for social media and I’m still surprised some of his highlights get little to no traction. He drives hard, plays physical defense and loves transition basketball. You can see him always looking for contact at the basket. He is the type of dude in a pick-up basketball game that will run into a defender to throw up a shot and call, ‘foul.’ Like Garland, not the best pull-up guy—his bread and butter is the drive or the catch-and-shoot three. But unlike Garland, he hasn’t necessarily picked-up the shot discipline just yet.

He’s very decisive—both to his advantage and his detriment. At times, [you’ll see how read the floor right away and immediately make a move to the basket for the lay-in](https://youtu.be/RWCuo4vhS4o?t=339). Seriously, [you can tell right away when he wants to score](https://youtu.be/1BD7yQFMurg?t=12).At other times, he can come off as a ball-hog. Most of the times, [its Tristan Thompson setting a screen and then not doing anything so Sexton just takes the shot because of the created space](https://youtu.be/1BD7yQFMurg?t=69).

The personality differences while still having fairly similar games at the professional level is what makes the thought of the two working together so intriguing. Truthfully, Sexton needs Garland more than Garland needs Sexton. If you had to give one away right now—with no context on the future and based on current value alone, not potential, you’d probably give away Sexton. Despite how raw and gifted Sexton is, Darius can lead an offense alone. Collin, on the other hand, will need another primary ball-hander to allow for moments where Sexton can move without the ball. Because of his speed and his attract to the basket, [you can rely on Sexton to look for a clever cut to the basket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crQ7wt7r0Gk). 

But right now, I don’t think you want to give away either. Because at moments in time, their dynamic has been incredibly fun to watch. The pace changes, offensive flow changes have been at times, an advantage for the Cavs. However, the current talent on the roster cannot facilitate this backcourt. The lack of shooting from their bigs, Kevin Love not necessarily being in the right headspace to develop an offensive system doesn’t help.

Garland and Sexton aren’t the problem. You cannot expect to build a house with the leftovers of a demolished one. Unfortunately, the young duo will still be in the receiving end of criticism. And it won’t be anything that they personally do. They aren’t horrendous in their individual stat lines, they are simply stuck in one of the worst—if not the worst—basketball situations in the NBA. 

It doesn’t mean that they shouldn’t keep doing what they are doing.

The odd couple backcourt is showing glimpses of what was expected—two guys that can run an offense in their unique way. But without a team, anything they’re able to generate simply falls flat. It really does feel like a pick-up team where the front court is basically just holding a spot in the line-up while the guards attempt to get buckets. Statistically, its tough to get a good read on the future of Sexton and Garland. Because for how bad their statistics are, watching them play, it doesn’t appear to be all them. If a teammate doesn’t want to roll to the basket, if a teammate cannot hit an open shot, if a teammate cannot protect the rime—is it the guards fault for letting these opportunities happen?

I'm mostly just curious if anyone knows much about sports medicine and/or general physiology enough to say wether weight plays a significant role in injuries in the NBA - and if that rule/principle would apply to Blake.

My opinion, without knowing much about the subject: I've always observed NBA players generally being fairly lean. LeBron James aside, I don't know many NBA athletes who are known for being 'bulky strong' and not simply 'leg/lean strong.'

And based on the fact that he hasn't really dropped much of that 'thiccness' makes me wonder why that is. Maybe the PT specialists already determined it didn't have to do with weight.. or maybe there was more confidence in modern medicine and the treatments. If so maybe its not fair to put this on Blake for not trying.

On the other hand, maybe he should be criticized for his massive build (Greek god) - being as talented and skilled as he is I think it could be argued that he really doesn't need that amount of raw strength since his earlier years?

In Euro soccer leagues, teams are permitted to loan players to other teams. How it works: Player X is under contract with Team A. Team A does not have the playing time, or development opportunities for Player X. Team A loans player X to team B for a specified duration of time, typically 1 year. Team A retains Player X under contract, however salary is paid by Team B. Team B may provide some financial considerations, or offer another player on loan in exchange for taking on Player X on loan. 

Benefits for Player X
- go to a team where playing time is more stable (e.g. team with too many players at the same position: e.g. Knicks may want to loan out one of their many power forwards to a team needing one, and get a draft pick for their cooperation)
- go to a team where development time is available (e.g. young player on a veteran team that won't get minutes, but is too good to go to the G-League e.g. Terence Davis may be loaned out to a team needing a backup PG now that Raptors have Lowry, Fred, Norm at the guard spots. Raptors get a draft pick for their cooperation)
- go to a team where contention for a championship is available (e.g. veteran player on a rebuilding team but contract too large to trade e.g. Chris Paul to Lakers or Heat. Clippers get a draft pick for their cooperation)

Benefits for Team A (Loaner):
- maximize utility of assets (Iguodala is likely more useful as a player to a contending team than to Memphis; Memphis receives some of that value back in the form of a draft pick. Iguodala stays on Memphis's salary cap but his salary is paid out by the team he is loaned to. Much better than the alternative scenario of a contending team waiting for a vet to be bought out, and the former team not receiving any compensation for facilitating the process)
- continued development of youth if you are a contending team (e.g. Zhaire Smith is likely not getting any playing time on the 76ers behind Embiid, Horford and Harris. He may get more opportunity on a young team known for player development e.g. OKC)
- may want to remove a player from your team due to interpersonal conflict (e.g. Waiters &amp; Heat)
- embrace the tank (GSW season over so loan out Draymond; get him back for next season)

Benefits for Team B (Loanee):
- get an additional player for this season without sacrificing future cap space (GSW season over so can loan Draymond to Heat for this season only)
- injury replacement (e.g. if Capela goes down, Houston could be loaned Tristan Thompson for one season only)
- trial run for a player that doesn’t have a future with current team but you may want to sign in the offseason (e.g last year Robin Lopez and Bulls)
- bring back a beloved veteran on his farewell tour for 1 game without hurting cap space (Vince to raptors, Joakim Noah to bulls)",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,73001,public,self,The NBA would benefit from an inter-team player loan system,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/eajuot/the_nba_would_benefit_from_an_interteam_player/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are likely headed for a top four seed in the East. However, they still have their deficiencies, and while they are able to hang with top teams like the Lakers as seen tonight, there is always room for improvement. Kevin Love’s public availability may be a good opportunity to reinforce their frontcourt in a win now effort.


Miami gives
-	Dion Waiters (12.1)
-	Meyers Leonard (11.2 expiring)
-	James Johnson (15.3m)


Cleveland gives
-	Kevin Love (28.9m)
-	John Henson (9.7m expiring)


Why Miami does it:
Consolidates marginal players all with contracts that will expire by 2021. None of these pieces are important moving forward. Since Miami is capped out, their best chance at acquiring a capable starter is via trade. Kevin Love gives them defensive rebounding and three point shooting next to Bam in place of Olynyk/Leonard. In this instance, Love’s contract duration may even be beneficial to Miami so they have contract control over another quality player.


Why Cleveland does it:
Long term flexibility. This is a Cleveland team still firmly at square one of the rebuild. One of the best ways to accelerate that process would be to unload Love’s max. While in the short term it is not immediately rewarding to create cap space for a cratering team, but the landscape of the NBA radically shifts quickly. In three years, it’s entirely possible Cleveland finds a franchise cornerstone two years in the future. Not having Love’s contract around makes it far easier to surround a young core with veteran contributors.


Picks may ultimately be the hangup in this deal. Cleveland has insisted they want a first for Love. Miami has their first this year but that also represents the opportunity to develop a player on a rookie contract into a rotation guy. They may feel entitled to draft compensation given Love’s albatross status.

Their ratings are tanking which is made even worse when compared to the NFL's rise in ratings.

One big difference between the league is, in the NFL, divisions are incredibly important. Bears vs Packers, Eagles vs Cowboys, 49ers vs Seahawks are just three major rivalries in the NFL. 

With the NBA, divisions are pretty much irrelevant. There are pretty much no long standing rivalries between divisional opponents (expect MAYBE between the Texas teams).

I think the NBA should make divisions matter more and I have one idea how to do it.

First, each conference only gets six playoff teams a opposed to eight. This might make it a non starter for the NBA sadly.

Basically, the top two teams in each division would make the playoffs. I'd also support playing more of your games in division. 

One other theory I have is to have divisions not based on geography but based on popular. With three divisions in each conference, denote the franchises based on Large Market Franchises, Medium Market Franchises, and Small market franchises. I don't have the divisions done exactly by population but that is definitely the guide.

West 
Large Markets - Lakers, Clippers, Warriors, Mavericks, Rockets

Medium Markets - Suns, Nuggets, Timberwolves, Spurs, Blazers (spurs would be a small market due to size but they've been placed here and the Kings moved to small markets)

Small Markets - Grizzlies, Pelicans, Thunder, Kings, Jazz

East

Large Markets - Knicks, Nets, Bulls, Raptors, Celtics (Philly is a larger market than Boston but I promoted the Celtics)

Medium Markets - Wizards, 76ers, Hawks, Heat, Pistons

Small Markets - Magic, Pacers, Hornets, Cavs, Bucks

This has many advantages in my opinion. The first one is that two huge markets being rivals is good for business. Just like how the Eagles vs Cowboys, Red Sox vs Yankees, Giants vs Dodgers, Rams vs 49ers rivalries are good for their leagues. Also, this is anecdotal, but I feel like fans would enjoy being rivals with an equally sized city.

Chicago and New York have somewhat of a rivalry in their populaces, why not bring that to the court?

Milwaukee and Cleveland are both rebounding rust belt cities, they would make a great rivalry.

Out west, Lakers and Clippers is a natural rivalry. Same with Houston and Dallas.

I also think Minneapolis and Denver would be great rivals. Two markets where basketball is borderline irrelevant, two markets that are medium sized and away from the coasts.

The only downside would be if you expanded the league or relocated the divisions would be all kinds of fucked up.

Anthony Davis is averaging more points than LeBron on 1 less shot attempt. His defense is unbelievable, and it really propels the team forward; he can guard 1-5 and do a fairly good job at all of it. He makes it very difficult for teams to try and attack the paint, because of his presence. He's a top 3 defender in the league and a top 10 offensive player.

Yes, LeBron is averaging 10.8 assists, and I then i look at Trae young putting up 8 assists a game, and i wonder how much more different it would be if he had shooters around him, or if he had AD, Dwight and javale.

There are no subjects off limits and no quarter is given. But there is one subject that never fails to elicit strong consternation from Kenny despite roars of laughter from Shaq— Charles Barkley’s bit about the Big ol Women™ of San Antonio. If you haven’t seen it, here’s one of my favorite supercuts to catch you up:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7GPuudYY5k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7GPuudYY5k)

As you can see, Chuck is fascinated with San Antonio — well, with the women and churros of San Antonio at least. He brings up the subject so often that simply googling “San Antonio Women” yields almost exclusively articles and clips of Barkley &amp; Co. discussing the virtues of San Antonio churros, the Big ‘ol Women™ who eat them, and the city’s curious lack of Victoria’s Secret stores. 

 [google search results for generic query ""San Antonio Women""](https://imgur.com/a/etH4ESK) 

From his time as a [player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMzdAZ3TjCA), to his current career as a broadcaster, Barkley is known for not minding his tongue. When it comes to making Shaq and the production crew keel over with laughter, it’s clear he has no plans to change his humorous tone, no matter how much Ernie scorns him.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;***But did you ever wonder why…***  
&gt;  
&gt;***Why is Chuck so fixated on the Big ol Women*****™** ***of San Antonio and their unique pastry/ lingerie inclinations?***  
&gt;  
&gt;***Is there something more behind the man’s obsession?***

&amp;#x200B;

So began my search to understand the enigma that is Charles Wade Barkley…

# The Research

I started out by attempting to confirm or refute Barkley’s suspicions… 

* Does San Antonio have a lot of Big ol Women™? 
* Is Victoria really a “Secret” in San Antonio?, and
* How do fried Spanish pastries play into this whole thing?

Well let’s break it down one-by-one…

&amp;#x200B;

**San Antonio’s Big ol Women™**

I compared obesity rates for every NBA city to determine if there is any merit to Chuck’s claim that San Antonio has an abundance of plus-sized ladies…

[NBA cities ranked by obesity rates](https://imgur.com/a/El9olqY)

As it turns out, he is right on point. According to my analysis of a 2018 CDC report, San Antonio is the 4th chunkiest city in the NBA with more than 37% of adults registering as “clinically obese”. And with over half of San Antonians identifying as female, it’s safe to say the city *does* have a lot of *Big ol Women™*.

Interesting side note: San Antonio isn’t just one of the fattest cities in the nation, they also have a distinct love for the rolls (pun intended). Per my research, San Antonio ranks #2 in the country for most google searches for “BBW”, which is of course the porn abbreviation for *Big Beautiful Women*. Not sure the significance of this fact, or how I came upon this information, but thought it was worth mentioning.

[Google trend statistics for search term ""BBW""](https://imgur.com/a/lsjGd0R)

*How many of these searches belong to Chuck himself? No small amount, I can assure you.*

**“Who’s Victoria?” — San Antonio**

Using [Victoria’s Secret store locator](https://www.victoriassecret.com/store-locator), I compiled the total number of store locations in each NBA city. Then, using 2016 U.S. Census Bureau statistics, I appended the populations for each city and calculated the amount of Victoria’s Secret stores per capita.

[NBA cities ranked by Victoria's Secret stores per capita](https://imgur.com/a/e70lGcN)

Again, Chuck’s intuition was spot-on! The city of San Antonio has the 4th fewest number of Victoria’s Secret stores per capita of all NBA cities (bottom 89th percentile).

I guess it’s safe to conclude, Victoria really is a secret in San Antonio.

*The author contacted Victoria’s Secret Public Relations prior to publishing this article but they chose not to comment on this story.*

&amp;#x200B;

**How do fried Spanish pastries play into this?**

Tremendously, that’s how.

I literally spent over three hours immersed in “churro data”. Admittedly, one of those hours was a lunchtime run to “Angel’s Churros &amp; Chocolates” in Houston, TX — shout out to Maria for hooking it up with the Nutella on the side!

Using cutting-edge scientific research tools, I determined the number of churro vendors per capita in each NBA city. Okay, I googled that shit. I figured counting Mexican restaurants in general would be super misleading so I quantified specifically the number of churro vendors in each NBA city using the following criteria: Performed the google search “\[CITY\] Churros” (e.g., “San Antonio Churros”) and counted the amount of vendors with *explicit* references to “Churro” in the name. I accepted various spellings and puns (e.g., “xurros”, or “Churroholic”, etc).

[NBA cities ranked by churro vendors per capita](https://imgur.com/a/IsgQbLY)

Well Mr. Barkley’s hunch was right again… San Antonio has the 4th most Churro-Vendors per capita in the NBA (top \~90th percentile). Have to admit, though, I did *not* expect to see Salt Lake City rank so high on this list. Considering the [strip club rankings](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dt0ucg/i_analyzed_james_hardens_performance_in_every_nba/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), I might actually have to make a trip to the ‘great white west’… 

We have to give credit to Chuck here; he certainly knows his stuff! But for a man who [disavows data science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZf9NFaCQHQ), it begs the question, how does he know so much about the Alamo city?

# The Analysis

With my suspicions on the rise, I dug deeper into the data. And the more I dug, the more it smelled… \*sniff\* and I love the smell of cinnamon and projection in the morning. So what is Mr. Barkley hiding? Well, I analyzed his career performance in San Antonio to see if there is more to the story.

Charles Barkley has an [impressive resume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley): two-time Olympic gold medalist, 11-time NBA All Star, 1993 Most Valuable Player, and an esteemed member of the NBA hall of fame. He went by the intimidating moniker, *Round Mound of Rebound*. He is, indubitably, one of the greatest ballers of all time. But, just like all the greats, he had a weakness…

**‘The Biggest Loser’**

Between the years 1983–1998, Barkley played 19 games in San Antonio. *He won just 4 of them*. With his career road-win percentage at nearly .500, and considering the other damning stats laid out below, his .211 win rate in San Antonio falls soundly in the *curious* column.

* Career Road W/L Record: 259–276 (.484 win%)
* San Antonio W/L Record: 4–15 (.211 win%)

[Barkley W/L splits - career-away vs career in SA](https://imgur.com/a/O4oKf9r)

Now I don’t want to mislead you, San Antonio were no schmucks during this period and, obviously, basketball is a team sport. But Barkley carries most of the water: he was a generational talent and the stand-out star on most of his teams (aside from a couple years with a washed up Julius Erving and an aging Moses Malone in Philly and a couple with near-retirement Hakeem in Houston). But the following analysis should help make my case.

**‘My -25% Life’**

San Antonio proved to be a blight on Barkley’s esteemed career. My analysis showed significant declines in almost every statistical category examined:

* **GmSc** — Averaged a **-25% variance** in Game Score in SA compared to career avg
* **ORB** — Averaged a -**11% variance** in Offensive Rebounds in SA as compared to career avg
* **FT%** — Averaged a **-9% variance** in FT shooting efficiency in SA as compared to career avg
* **FG%** — Averaged a **-2% variance** in shooting efficiency in SA as compared to career avg
* **AST** — Averaged a **-6% variance** in Assists in SA as compared to career avg

Note: [GmSc](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/glossary.html) (Game Score) is a John Hollinger-created stat that gives a comprehensive measure of a player’s productivity. Formula: *GmSc=PTS+(0.4\*FG)–(0.7\*FGA)–\[0.4\*(FTA-FT)\]+(0.7\*ORB)+(0.3\*DRB)+STL+(0.7\*AST)+(0.7\*BLK)–(0.4\*PF)-TOV*

[Here’s what the analysis looks like](https://imgur.com/a/iSCfcll)

You can see the heat map to the left is covered in red. Red cells indicate *negative* variances, meaning: for that year, Barkley’s average in San Antonio was *below* his Season Average. Of the 112 total data points examined (8 stats x 14 seasons), Barkley under-performed against the season average **62%** of the time.

Heat maps are great but I needed to visualize the data in a way that better depicts the scale of Chuck’s drop in performance. I used a clustered column chart because it gives the best visual representation of relative performance, as you can easily identify the +/- trends (*Graphs for Dummies: larger/more frequent lines on BOTTOM = BAD; larger/more frequent lines on TOP = GOOD*). 

[Variance charts by stat category](https://imgur.com/a/icftPyw)

 These huge performance declines are damning. But what do they *tell us*?  


# Conclusion

Well, if you’ve been following along, things should be starting to make sense. A picture has formed… how could a man who so ardently rebukes data science, know things about San Antonio that only the *data* can tell us?Every Great had their weakness. MJ couldn’t stop gambling. Shaq couldn’t shoot free throws. Magic couldn’t keep it in his pants. Kobe never saw a shot he didn’t like. LeBron, hairline.For Charles Barkley, it was an entire city. The plus-sized women of San Antonio and their delectable Spanish pastries were the Round Mound’s kryptonite. And it appears he never got over it. A career of indulgence in the Alamo City has left him bitter with regret.The Chuckster has used his platform on TNT to — not very credibly — disguise his own predilections for the amenities of San Antonio. Without stretching the facts too far, we can paint a vivid picture of Barkley’s own struggle. Imagine: a perpetual Big-and-Tall man since roughly the age of 12 (guessing) and an basketball phenom would have become accustomed to night-after-night by himself with nothing but his appetite and a sense that — thanks to his coaches — he *deserved* to be rewarded. That he was a *good boy*. Another city, another game, another 4-star hotel room to himself (another sold-out show, as it were).The excitement of seeing San Antonio on the schedule brings tears to the man’s eyes. He knows what awaits him and purposefully forgets what happened before…

&gt;*Barkley, awaken by the morning sun’s blistering reflection off the San Antonio R̶i̶v̶e̶r̶* [*Creek*](https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/San-Antonio-River-Authority-fires-back-at-Charles-5465978.php)*, sees the debris and refuse from an all-night binge. He did it again. Churro wrappers crinkling beneath his weight, cinnamon sugar coating the corners of his mouth and fingers alike, and a familiar wave of anxiety that tends to come after relapse. As his memory from the prior night returns, he glances around the room with a vain hopefulness that he did not ‘fall’ alone. He was relieved to learn that, in fact, he was not alone in the previous night’s debasement. Positioned heavily — nay, crushingly — on the duvet is a Big ol Woman™ sporting a handsome pair of* [*bloomers*](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Lolita-Women-Sweet-Bloomers-Underwear-Pumpkin-Shorts-Safety-Pants-Cosplay-/182538951060)*. Her voluminous mass reassuring him — no, beckoning him — to forgive himself for his indiscretions. It wasn’t just him after all. But he knew exactly what he had done. In a rush to forget, he licked the crusted cinnamon from his lips, quietly donned his game day attire and snuck out to meet his teammates in the lobby.*   
&gt;  
&gt;*But his mind would never leave that hotel room.*

It is through painting this portrait of a man both conflicted and passionate (aren’t we all) that we can better understand the system of associations that have led Barkley to betray his own naked psychology for all the world to jeer at. And yet, can we blame the man? Are we not all, on some level, looking for someone to share in our appetites? Whether it be for the occasional night of plus-size women and churros, or too many designer handbags; everyone has a vice. Unfortunately, from years of shame for letting down his teammates and coaches, Chuck has betrayed the very thing that he loves. 

That’s why I’m here to tell him, myself: **Stop Projecting, Mr. Barkley.** 

**In 2019, the year of proclaimed** **ass-eating, there is** ***no*** **shame. It’s** ***okay*** **to stan for Big ol Women™.** 

**In fact, it’s** ***great.***

He argues that players like Chris Paul and Kevin Love are making so much money that few teams have the ability to match salaries in a trade and those teams that do can't make the trade without gutting their entire roster. 

[He fired off a couple of tweets about this yesterday, which I think captures the gist of his discontent](https://twitter.com/BillSimmons/status/1205154632961384448)

His solution is to change the rule so that teams only need to match 50% of the value of the player they're trading for. Under the current system, teams can only take back at most 125% of the salary they send out.

Setting aside whatever you think about Simmons' solution, I do think he's on to something about how difficult it is to trade for the NBA's most expensive players.

I downloaded the annual salaries for every player since the 2011-12 season from [spotrac](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/rankings/2020/base/) and [plotted the distribution of those salaries each year.](https://imgur.com/AYqNnHe)

As you can see, the distribution of salaries has always been right skewed, meaning a select group of players makes a lot more than the rest of the league. However, over the years, the distribution has only increased in skew-iness. 

In other words, while the distribution has always been unequal to a degree, the distance between the middle class of players and the upper class of players appears to have grown over the past several years. 

Another way to think about this is by looking at the average annual salaries for different percentile groups. 

[In this chart](https://imgur.com/zxxEtjy), I plotted the average annual salaries from 2011-12 - 2019-2020 for 5 different groups: 

- The bottom 20% of the league 

- The 21st to 50th percentile 

- The 51st to 80th percentile 

- The 81st to 90th percentile 

- And the 91st to 100th percentile 

Clearly, the average salaries for all five groups has increased since 2012. That shouldnt be surprising with the increase in the salary cap and increasing values in salaries like the Vet-minimum. However, it does appear that the vast most of the gains in salary have been captured by the most expensive players. 

In 2012, the gap between the average salary for a player in top 10% and the average salary for a player in the 51st to 80th percentile was about $9.2M. This year, the gap between those two groups is about $22.4M. 

**My question to you all is does this widening gap between the top 10% and the rest of the league suggest the NBA ought to tinker with the salary matching requirements for trades?**",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,72934,public,self,[OC] Has the changing distribution of salaries in the NBA made it more difficult to trade for high-end/expensive talent?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ea5aa6/oc_has_the_changing_distribution_of_salaries_in/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I realized my title was a play on a Star Wars movie. I've never watched Star Wars. Kind of an accident and I'm not creative enough to think of a new title so deal with it.*

Back in 2017, the Detroit Pistons were on the clock with the 12th pick in the NBA Draft. Analysts would spend most of that time discussing how surprising it was for Malik Monk to fall all the way to 11. Rece Davis will manage to sneak in a quick 30-second briefing on how the Pistons would need a shooter and with 1 minute and 30 seconds remaining, Adam Silver was on the stage to announce that the Pistons had selected Luke Kennard.

There would be polite clapping. Muffled cheers, no boos. He would embrace his family, embrace a Donovan Mitchell that would soon hear his name called and make his way to the stage.

Jay Bilas would talk about Kennard’s footwork, discuss his range and drop a comment of, “He will be able to hang.” It was a comment that most fans would understand—that he wouldn’t be embarrassed on the national stage—but not a comment that would provide comfort for fans.

He wouldn’t be a true starter for sometime. Stuck behind Avery Bradley, splitting minutes with Langston Galloway his first year, stuck behind Reggie Bullock and Bruce Brown while still splitting minutes with Langston Galloway in his second, he waited. 

And during a late October evening of his third year, Dwane Casey gave him the nod to earn the full-time gig. Citing offense struggles, Kennard would be seen as the man to remedy the issue. Scoring 59 points in the first three games, including his career high of 30 on night one of the NBA, Casey had every right to believe in the former Duke player.

In his first start of the season against Indiana, he would hit 5 out of 11, 3 out of 6 from three, assist on 4 and more importantly, be  a +10 in the second win of the season for Detroit. It was the start of something.

Luke Kennard has been subject to a lot of discussion early in his career. Being the guy that was picked before Donovan Mitchell comes with consequences. Was he just going to be another white guy from Duke—that would just come in and shoot threes? Was he going to be able to make it at the next level? 

And at the start, it felt like he would be. He would average 20-minutes a game, coming off the bench. You could rely on him for a couple of threes a night. Clearly he wasn’t Stan Van Lundy’s favorite but if you would watch him play, there was some character to his play. Fans of the college level would remember that Luke Kennard had to be the foil for players like Grayson Allen, Jaysn Tatum, Brandon Ingram while still developing his own personality. He would let his play speak for itself, quietly having nights where he would pop-off over 30 points but you wouldn’t even blink. 

Kennard was much more than just a shooter out of college but an offensive threat. His ability to drive often went unnoticed, as well as his ability to pass the basketball. He was very much capable of creating his own shot but would have to earn his team’s trust. For his first year in the NBA, 70.4% of his shots made were assisted. This year, its only 60.2%. He would also receive the label of being a catch-and-shoot guy—taking 62% of his shots after holding the ball for less than 2 seconds. Now, only 47.2% of his shots are taken in that span of time.

He has aged extremely well in a relatively short period of time. The question is…how?

It starts with a couple of lucky breaks. The Blake Griffin trade back in January of 2018 was the start. Avery Bradley’s minutes suddenly became available. It also resulted in the departure of Tobias Harris. The re-invented ‘Blake of the Year’ candidate would provide a different look to the 4. He would be more ball dominant, have the ability to force defenders to guard him across the court as he developed a three point shot. It also meant that the Pistons would look to generate more opportunities for teammates around the perimeter with the combo of Griffin and  Andre Drummond. 

Luke Kennard would luck out again with a coaching change. Van Gundy did not initially fancy the guard from Duke. Despite providing optimistic commentary for press conferences, his search for confidence from the guard often times would be met with the lack of providing confidence as a coach. While Van Gundy would warm up to the guard, praising his offensive ability and provide more opportunities for the guard, we wouldn’t see the next steps in the relationship of Kennard and VG as Dwane Casey would step up to take over the job as head coach.

Still coming off of the bench, Kennard would slowly develop more and more. Casey’s coaching style and bench management would help improve Luke’s confidence. Unfortunately, injuries to his knee and shoulder would plague his second season with in the association. Casey would make the move to have Kennard play more and more of the small forward position while working him back into the line-up. He would go from a 29% of his gamete being at the 3 in year 1, 82% usage at the 3 in year 2. It was a small change but a change that helped open line-up management. The two biggest questions were the 2 and 3 for Detroit—why not have a guy that could play both in an effective manner?

Which brings us to this year. This year is just different. The second year is often the most important year for a coach. Casey has taken all of the information from his first year in Detroit, made his adjustments and put together his vision of the future.

He started with making a lot of adjustments to his backcourt. The draft choice of Sekou Doumbouya, trading for Tony Snell signaled the search for depth in the wing. But with injury luck, it didn’t harm Kennard—he was able to split time in the two with Langston Galloway or Brown and could take minutes from Snell and Svi Mykhailiuk.

Casey would also develop a system with a lot more offensive flexibility. With Blake wanting to take on a bigger role, Casey would have to react. He would implement three systems:

The first was the usage of two high screens: the first of which would open one player to receive the ball at the top of the zone and the second to open up said player for a drive or an open view of the court at the top of the key.  

Next would be the usage of a similar two-man game with stacked side of the court. Often times, it would be the easiest way to get the screen-and-roll game going but also create options for players that would inevitably collapse on the drive—creating a wide open three. 

And then there is the high-post low-post game—where Blake holds the ball at the top, Drummond sits in the low post and players work their way around the court to get open—often times involving Griffin acting as a wall with a ball. 

The offensive schemes have worked—Detroit is surprisingly the best team from behind the arch, shooting 39.2% on 32 attempts a game. But interesting enough, they’re one of the most efficient teams in the league. They only average 84 shots a game will and have shot 47% from the field. They’re slow—again, towards the bottom in pace (98.81) and methodical—having a turnover percentage of 16.7%. 

It also leads to Detroit drawing a lot of fouls. Because of how much the team moves, utilizing a lot of cuts to the basket to the basket and the style of play that has been brought together. Drummond’s work on the boards, Detroit’s ability to draw contact at the basket have both been incredibly important to opening up the offense end.

Detroit is slowly figuring things out on the defensive end. Again, not the best defensive team out there—they’re at least disciplined, averaging towards the bottom in fouls as a team. Because of concerns over the ability of some defenders on the team, Casey has brought in a take on the zone defense—which has also allowed from Drummond to continue to be the rim presence he’s been requested to be. But truthfully, questions about Kennard’s ability to be a defender at the next level have been exaggerated. He hasn’t been terrible, often doing a solid job at staying with defenders. 

All of these systematic changes have truly benefited Kennard. He isn’t expected to play fast, he isn’t expected to be a catch-and-shoot guy despite having one of the most beautiful strokes in the association right now. Instead, he’s able to create space for himself. He’s able to play his game of basketball.

His shooting splits tell the story, 56.3% of his shots from the field are classified as open or wide open—meaning there is 4+ feet between him and the closet defender. He went from being a 41.3% catch-and-shoot type of player in his rookie year to a 31.5% catch-and-shoot rate. Now, he mostly focuses on his pull-up game, which has been great at using his offensive IQ to find space and ensure he’s taking the correct shot. Kennard has opened his range—taking 147 from 24+ feet out but what has also been intriguing is his use of the mid range. Because of the spacing on the floor and Kennard’s sneaky handles and football, he’s able to stop on a dime.

Let’s look at a couple of examples of what Kennard has been able to do.

[Drummond sets the high screen and Brooklyn plays the drive fairly well](https://youtu.be/bUw59wh2cV8?t=223). Kyrie Irving does a good job at fighting through the screen and cutting off the possibility of the straight roll from Andre—even if it was a lazy roll to begin with. Kennard steps towards the center and checks two things: if Andre is rolling and how Kyrie is attacking. Coming in off balanced, Luke is able to pump fake Irving on the shake, bait out Jordan onto Andre and hit a silky smooth mid-range jumper.

[The Pistons settle in for a half-court overload](https://youtu.be/rMR6gbgJGP8?t=176. Kennard receives the ball and again, Drummond will be the one to set the high screen. The remaining members of the Pistons are settled around the arch—ready to receive if a defender collapses onto Kennard. Even with a collapsing defender, Kennard is able to get in an easy floater. 

And of course, human wall Blake Griffin and Kennard work again from the overload](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qKhgBgGc2Q). Instead, Griffin simply uses his body to create space for Kennard. There is efficient passing that works the Hornets defender who originally missed the assignment but the ease of how Griffin was able to create the shot for Kennard simply shouldn’t go unnoticed. 

Even some of the simple things he’s able to do look good. —[keep his head up in transition but also have the awareness that he’s really good at shooting the three and the Pacers give him a wide open look](https://youtu.be/ZsDTnXbh-U8?t=96).

Kennard has quietly been one of the best things going in the east. Despite not being the signature guy you would look at in the Pistons line-up—a line that should receive praise of Derrick Rose continuing to do Derrick Rose things, Drummond playing well and Blake Griffin being Blake Griffin, Kennard is playing an integral role for the Dwane Casey offense. His flexibility in roles while still playing the same game is simply fun to watch. And since his move to the starting line-up, he hasn’t been the burden that was once thought of him.  

He isn’t the best player on the Pistons. This isn’t a piece stating that Derrick Rose’s performance hasn’t been helpful, this isn’t a piece saying that Blake Griffin isn’t providing a case to be one of the best 10 players in the NBA. Luke Kennard simply has been one of the most important players on this Pistons team—mostly due to his ability to show how great of a natural scorer he is. He’s been the player that has allowed for Griffin/Drummond line-up to work. He has been the player to allow for Casey and staff to test what their backcourt should look. He’s going to be the player that allows for Sekou to enter the line-up and transition into the NBA in a manner that is much easier for the bright talent out of France.

Down the line, there will be questions of ‘can he take it to the next level’ and there aren’t signs that Kennard has reaching his ceiling just yet. The concern could be, how much time will it take to figure out where the ceiling is? With how valuable the wing is in the modern NBA, having a good one is a blessing. Kennard’s skill set is something valued by most and could lead to him being a trade piece for Detroit’s search for something bigger. But quietly, he should be off-limits. 

He’s shown that he is more than a role player and someone that serves a starting position in the association. The question is, will Detroit realize his value to the team instead of looking for the next thing.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,72896,public,self,[OC] How Luke Kennard is Bringing a New Hope to the Detroit Pistons,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/e9xiba/oc_how_luke_kennard_is_bringing_a_new_hope_to_the/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One in particular stands out as clearly the best player to me. Luka Doncic. He is having an MVP type season this year. Currently has the Mavs 3rd in the West as the sole all star. Doncic is the driving force behind the top ranked offense in the NBA at age 20. The best 20 year old basketball player of all time. He is personally my pick to be the best player of the next decade. Doncic is almost 4.5 years younger. I would take his skill and bball iq over Giannis's superior physical traits. Not that Giannis has low skill or bball iq, Doncic just might be the greatest basketball savant the league has ever seen. He is the Wayne Gretsky of the NBA. Is able to see and anticipate at an all time level.

After Doncic, it is tough for me to choose among a talented crop of young point guards. All of these guys project to be corner stone pieces of their franchises. I believe all will go to multiple all star games in the next decade, and have All NBA upside.

3. J. Morant

Why Aren’t the Memphis Grizzlies Better?

Sometimes, you can have all of the evidence in the world to have confirmation of your belief.[ Like the clip from *SpongeBob*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGOPPzh8TJ4), you could have a wallet with a picture, confirmation that the person in the picture is standing in front of you and they could still deny its their wallet. 

The Memphis Grizzlies were supposed to see the growth we’ve now seen from the Phoenix Suns. A young point guard and a strong front court was supposed to lead the Memphis Grizzlies back into contention for a possible 8th seed. The statistics even provide significant reason to believe that the individual performances of the team are improving compared to last year. However, it feels as if the team has taken a step back. 

Back in college, Ja Morant was the ‘Mr. Do-Everything’ for Murray State. He was their offense, their fearless leader, their soul. It was one of the few examples where a player could carry his team on his back in college. The value Morant was supposed to provide was a player that could immediately run an offense, score  and more importantly, better his teammates. His explosiveness along with his offensive basketball IQ alone should alone bring out the best of his team.

[And he does. His ability to create and finish wasn’t exaggerated. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_9PRgJASw)


He unfortunately does have the downfalls that come with said style. He averages the second most turnovers per game among guards and nearly has a 3:1 ratio of turnovers created by bad passes (35) to turnovers created by losing the ball (12). Morant also still has to work on taking fouls when he drives to the basket. With how crafty he tries to be, he’ll avoid contact from his defender’s body body but won’t avoid contact that is his shot getting blocked. But for a guy who just got brought to the adult table at Thanksgiving, not bad. 

*Side bar— Morant isn’t as great of a shooter as you would like to see. He’s shooting 44.3% from the field—not terrible—but not the level you would expect from someone that’s probably going to win ‘Rookie of the Year’ on a pretty bad team. He’s still an excellent talent to have out of the gate—which is why even spent time questioning why the team wasn’t better. This is  more of a ‘questioning the narrative’ type deal’ where there has been some stuff that doesn’t make complete sense about how he is as a player.*

Morant isn’t the only rookie the Grizzlies have lucked out on in 2019. Brandon Clarke has been a solid addition and would more than likely receive more notice in the NBA if it wasn’t for the fact he had to share minutes with Jaren Jackson Jr, Jonas Valančiūnas and an underrated Kyle Anderson. Memphis quietly has a big men that can push the pace in transition and can stroke it from deep. 

The modern NBA offense is still attempting to figure out the stretch big man. Memphis having multiple stretch big men at times feels like a blessing. But then at times, you lose the value of the true five. When Valančiūnas is out of the game, it doesn’t feel natural when Clarke, Anderson or Jackson are elected to fill the void. Because of how all three have the ability to score all of the court—and we mostly see Jonas coming from the pick-and-roll or in a post-up position, the style of the team changes. 

They still elect to run the high screen but the spacing, how options are viewed, completely changes. For example, you could expect Jonas to set the high screen, roll and awkward space the floor as a ’tip-in stalker’ or a genuine roll to the basket for an easy lay-in. Jackson prefers picking-and-popping for the top of the key three. Clarke enjoys dribbling and will likely work his way into the middle of the paint for a floater or set-up a give-and-go. 

Truthfully, it doesn’t feel like Memphis has an answer for how it wants to use its big men for. Its year two for Triple-J but his game still feels like a question mark. He’s seen a small improvement from deep but also is taking a lot more shots from deep and its taking away from his work on the inside. 43% of his shots are more than 24 feet from the basket. Also, 47% of his shots are less than 8 feet away from the basket. A critical mid-range game from the previous season is gone—even if he has opted for the ‘efficient style of shooting.’

But again, it hasn’t affected the overall team. Jaren Jackson averaging 16 points, 5 rebounds and 2 assist won’t ruin a team. Ja Morant’s 20, 3 and 6 won’t ruin the team. Jonas and Clarke aren’t holding the team back. Solomon Hill, Dillon Brooks and Tyus Jones are playing their roles—even if they aren’t incredible.

Jae Crowder hasn’t been great, that’s maybe been the most disappointing piece in all of this puzzle. His highs are high, his lows are very very low. Statistically, he’s been utter shit. But a man known for his hustle is still hustling. Since gaining more and more minutes, his search for a consistence 3-point shot is still a search. He feels the need to shoot the ball as fast as possible—75% of his shots are taking with a touch-time of less than 2 seconds and doesn’t have the discipline to really be a true spot-up shooter just yet. His heat check moments can get the people going but his cold moments just seem like a completely lost possession. 

All of this conversation leads us to the one big point: Memphis Grizzlies aren’t coached well. There is no system, there is no concept, there is no vision for the team.

So far, we haven’t seen a level of consistency with the team. Partially because when you try to be too creative, you sometimes lose the focus of what you were evening attempting to accomplish. It was why in moments, where the team completely spread out the floor and just allowed a play to naturally progress, they looked at their best. A simple high screen for Ja Morant, natural openness as the screen pop-outs and a clearer picture for what Morant could accomplish. 


The different looks they attempt to bring in, with their various styles, get lost in a cluster. You don’t make a soup with expensive ingredients, its usually the leftovers. Defenses are now able to read how a play will develop off of the screen. Even if the talent is there to make a poorly designed screen work, at times the play will get stopped in its tracks, leading to a horrible shot. 

Load management is a hot topic but you can’t manage a load every single game. Your star players averaging around 28-minutes a night isn’t an appealing thing. If you’re concerned about someone’s health, you don’t play them. You don’t let them get a taste of the game, get a flow going and then pull them out. Seriously, Jae Crowder is the only player that averages over 30-minutes a night and arguably, he’s been the biggest concern in that starting line-up. 

They rush on the offensive end of the floor. They average towards the top of the NBA in pace yet aren’t producing the offensive numbers to give a reason for why they should get up a shot as quick as possible. With how incredible their passing has been—one of the better team when it comes to assisted-percentage shots—why do they feel the need to rush down the floor and lose the advantage they have with their stretch positions? 

They have to figure out what the team is and what to build for. Because young talent don’t stay young forever. If they cannot find a grove, find what they’re good at, they look for the next thing.  

A personal recommendation would be a system seen at times with the Charlotte Hornets under James Borrego, where they will overload one side of the court to set-up three things: isolation for the ball-handler, the ability for openness around the perimeter, usage of high screens to open up for the drive and and the ability to expose defenses that will have to react to aggressive passing, as well as cheat on the drive. [Here’s a 26 minute session where Borrego goes over some of these topics in a 26 minute fundamentals sessions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkX2CJafDzI).

Or, we can just look at the modern Houston Rockets offense that runs the isolation offense to perfection under James Harden and previously with Chris Paul—where the goal wasn’t to open up a quick basket but force mismatches and frustrate defenses with how disciplined the guards of the Rockets are/were. 

It doesn’t feel as if Taylor Jenkins understands what his job is as a head coach. Never talk about a man’s job but he isn’t doing a good one. Searching for a balance with a somewhat deep raw line-up is difficult but intentionally disrupting the growth of talent and seeing how coaching adjustments aren’t working isn’t a good thing. He could be tanking for all of the wrong reasons. This has arguably been the weakest the middle of the west has looked for sometime and there is opportunity to get some play-off money—especially with the knowledge that this year’s NBA draft is ‘big-man heavy’ and the search for a great wing may not be there this year.


A team that has too much young depth, a team that has a star-in-the-making Point Guard shouldn’t be struggling to win games. There is always truth in that competition could simply be better but this does not appear to be the case. Even if Ja Morant has missed games—they’re 6 and 12, 1-4 without him. Tyus Jones is not a bad back-up point guard—albeit he’s a lot different from Ja’s style of play—and they have a possibly stud in De’Anthony Melton that deserves more minutes. The depth they have around the 4 and the 5 is a NBA wet dream. Quietly, the former Phoenix Suns guard Josh Jackson has been tearing it up in the G League but continues to struggle with personal issues, which is unfortunate because he could be an asset to the team this tear.. The talent is there but is drastically misused. 

It is a pain that Andre Iguodala isn’t going to play for the team. He could have been an excellent role player but his explanation for why he doesn’t want to play for Memphis and his personal ventures does make sense. 

The Grizzlies have moved past from their grit-and-grind ways but it doesn’t mean that the team should be underperforming as much as they are. It should be known they’ve had a tough schedule but two losses to Chicago and an incredibly poor performance against Golden State shouldn’t happen. Instead, there needs to be a conversation--unfortunate again--about if this team is being lead in the right direction. Stylistic confusion, misuse of talent appear to holding back the true potential of the Memphis Grizzlies.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,72800,public,self,[OC] The Talent Is Good.

But I am most definitely a Knicks fan. 

Things are looking bleak for us atm. But there are some positives. 

The first thing I'd do is NOT trade Marcus morris right away. Wait for offers to come in. We want an offer to come around February when teams are getting more and more desperate. However, if a team offers you a first or a decent young player for him (Anfernee Simmons or Zach Collins svp) then take it and run. However, Morris' value will go up as the season progresses and teams are kinda scrambling to make moves (Tobias Harris move last year is a good example).

Secondly, just try to sell off what you can right now. There isn't a big chance you can get much for the other guys' bar Morris but it's worth a shot. Unless someone offers a second and a salary match for Portis? Take it as long as the deal expires in the summer or in 2021. If not. Don't take it. Same applies for Taj Gibson (although he's probably the signing I hate the least this summer), Ellington and idek Bullock? However, unless a miraculous offer comes our way. Do NOT trade Randle yet. Let him finish up the year. Do I like Randle? No. But you'll see my logic in the next paragraph

Third, (after the season is done), we will probably have a top 5 pick let's be honest. Which isn't bad. We will also hopefully have attained a mid-teens pick - late first rounder for Marcus Morris.

Anyways, about Julius Randle. It's clear that the fit between us and Randle is just fucking horrible. Particularly RJ and Randle. It is clunky, doesn't look good and doesn't benefit either of their playstyles. I do think that Randle isn't that good. But the contract we gave him, in all honesty. Isn't THAT bad. It's VERY VERY VERY tradeable. Next year it will be an expiring with a team option to extend. Just about the easiest type of contract to trade. We have no reason to salary dump him and attach it with assets. If no good offer comes along, simply keep him on the roster and most importantly, play him on limited minutes (or even don't play him if it gets THAT bad)

Also, every single player the knicks have an option on, opt-out. The only player the Knicks should MAYBE consider bringing back is Taj Gibson because well idk. I just like Taj more than other players on our roster. And he's a good presence for Mitchell Robinson. However, if we lose him, no tears are shed.

In the offseason, yes, this is possible one of the worst FA classes in a while. That being said, not all hope is lost.

Steven Adams, Otto Porter (even tho he's playing okay this year), Evan Fournier (a little unfair to include him on this list, ik, but maybe the magic are looking to move on), Gorgiu Dieng, Dennis Schroeder, Cody Zeller, Batum, Kelly Olynk, Cristiano Felicio, KCP, Satoransky, Tony Snell, Trevor Ariza, Gordon Hayward if the injury woes are worse than anticipated, and probably a bunch more that I forgot to mention.

These are all guys that teams might wanna get off of their contracts, particularly KCP and Cristiano Felicio (lmao). The knicks can potentially free up 40 million in cap space next year. That's a lot of money. We will roughly have 57.74 M in cap if we opt out of a bunch of contracts and maybe end up with roughly 50m depending on where we pick in the NBA draft (this is WITH Randle still on the books)

What I would personally do is one of two things. Firstly, try to sign Ingram to a fair contract that maybe the pelicans will/will not match. I'm thinking in the ballpark of 20-25 Million.

Secondly, since the first option is likely to not work, just load tf up on salary dumps and picks. As many as possible. 2nd rounders, first-rounders, anything is better than nothing.

Also, shop around the league and see who is willing to buy players rn. A salary dump could be very attractive to other teams if a team needs one of our 'young core'. I'd be willing to shop around players like DSJr and maybe even Kevin Knox. A team will likely view this as a sweetener and would be willing to give up a first rounder in if it's a salary dump.

Hypothetical example:

DSJr and Julius Randle for Otto Porter, Cristiano Felicio(or Satoransky) and a 2022 First round pick top 10 protected (or lottery protected) from the bulls and a 2020 second rounder.

This is a fair and realistic trade for both sides imo - especially if the Bulls decide to trade high on markannen and cash out on his value. Then they'd have a hole at the 4 which Julius Randle can fill. Not to mention a young backup PG for Coby White.

There are dozens of other realistic trades our FO can do this offseason. We as fans can only do so much.

If I were to 'target' players this offseason to sign/acquire. Well, I think I would literally only target Brandon Ingram and maybe FVV and Bertans. 

The Knicks do need a PG, and to be quite honest, Lonzo Ball is exactly the type of PG I would want on the Knicks. Yes he's not perfect but neither are we. I like guards who can defend and there is a reason I said I'd rather trade DSJr. Ntilikina can be a decent backup PG and I think that his ceiling is realistically a P-Bev type PG.I'd also love for us to trade for D-Lo, but I don't think a trade would work out between us and the GSW because we simply don't have anything they'd want. 

The absolute best trade I can up with for D-Lo is something like 

D-Lo for Frank Ntilikina or Kevin Knox, Julius Randle and a future top 3 protected first rounder (which I think is a make or break for the deal)

A trade like that is okay but I don't think either team would accept that. Although I do think that Julius Randle would fare a lot better in an environment with shooters left and right.

The knicks most realistic route of finding a competent PG is through the draft. Also, the other thing the knicks really need besides well everything is shooting. If we do manage to get multiple firsts this year, our highest pick should be BPA (who is probably going to be a guard since it's a guard-heavy draft) and then we have to try to look for the absolute best shooters to help space the floor. Isaiah Joe is a guy I think the Knicks should take right away if he's available. But it's obviously too early to say.

Yes, the NBA’s $24 billion national TV deal isn’t up until 2025, but negotiations and agreements occur far in advance. These talks are happening now, with an eye toward the precarious present. If the sport is about to take a multi-billion dollar haircut, so much can change. If the next deal completely crashes? Well, corporations are structured based on embedded assumptions of continued growth. A massive contraction tends to kick off a cascading, destructive effect. Certain markets might not be viable. It’s one thing to have a team in, say, New Orleans, when owners are splitting that huge deal 30 ways. It’s another thing when the money spigot stops. If that happens, everything is on the table, including how many teams exist, how many games they play and the nature of how those games are broadcast. There’s a lot at stake.

He has several posts where he plots shot charts through whole decade.

So for this one, I took a look at [Kyrie's shot chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danchyy/Basketball_Analytics/master/Scripts/2019_20_season/images/kyrie_shotchart_text.png). 

Here is another [image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danchyy/Basketball_Analytics/master/Scripts/2019_20_season/images/kyrie%20shotchart.png) without the text on the zones.

As you can see Kyrie is an amazing shooter, which is pretty much known. Also the finishing under the rim is quite good given the fact that the colors are based on comparison with league average as a whole (so sum of all made shots divided by attempted), of all players not just guards. 58% finishing under the rim is good.

What really stands out though is his mid range shooting which is wayyy above league average, even though that might not be seen often in today's fast paced NBA which relies heavily on three pointers and under the basket.

I watched the finals a couple times on tv of course like the heat , Lakers  vs Celtics, warriors vs Cavs.

But I seen some disrespect comparing a.i to harden  and guards today  saying they are even better, and tbh you got A.I Fucked up maybe on stat sheets you could say so. But in reality no not at all  I started watching some games of A.i play and he was a different monster in a completely different era that boy could ball. He was banging in the paint constantly when NBA was rough playing through all types of injuries. He was fast as lightning, always moving hustling working an offball pest stupid handles had a nasty mid range jumper. Plus a killer instinct he was getting fouled with no calls and still kept driving on giants and showing heart and tenacity i watched the g1 finals against Lakers and i was amazed.
Basket ball looked so intense I wish i could have watched it then but if he played in this era now he would embarass these dudes. They get more space they get fouls for the littlest touch . If they get the smallest injury they damn near die they don't play and sit on the sideline in suits and all type of bs they got no grit some do but most don't .

 Today I'd take prime A.i on my team against any of these guards you think are better and let's see what happens I'm not even a hoop head yet and I can see that clearly. Ppl say he was an ""inefficient"" scorer in comparison but he wasn't . Again it was a different era the game has evolved every sport has and since it has evolved the game is more organized guys get better looks, better plays stronger ball iq etc etc but logically and contextually no they aren't maybe on paper yes but truthfully not even close. A.i would smash in todays league even harder than when he was playing and he was a legend then he would be a legend now. On the other hand alot of guards get busy now but could not get right when A.i was playing so ultimately A.i is better than ppl think and deserves alot more respect.

&gt; 1. They don't have enough depth and lack any play-makers outside of Lebron and potentially Rondo. 

&gt; 2. The team is rather old with Green, Howard, LeBron, and Rondo. 

&gt; 3. They don't have any defenders and their defense is going to be awful.

&gt; 4. AD/Lebron PnR is going to be impossible to stop. 

**Offense**

&gt; 1. Surprisingly I don't think their offense is as good as it can be. They have had some of their key players miss time in Rondo, Kuz and AB but the team is gelling well as of late. Kuz has also had slow start but he is still young and has time to get better as the season goes on. His shooting has improved but he makes some stupid mistakes. 

&gt; 2. Their lack of play-making has not been exposed at all. LeBron is having his best year in terms of a play-making and leading the league in assists. After rondo got back in the lineup the offense has flowed much better with the ball in his hands as opposed to Cook or Daniels.

&gt; 3. Early in the season there was some heavy discussion about having AD play the 5 because the paint is too clogged up. This has resolved as AD found his stroke and is knocking down jumpers.

&gt; 4. The AD and LeBron PnR/PnP has been working really well but the Lakers haven't been using it that much and I'm assuming they are saving this for the 4th quarter when AD is playing the 5 and for the playoffs. 

&gt; 5. They don't have a solid 3rd guy on this team but that hasn't hurt them as any one of their players has the potential to be the 3rd guy. KCP, Green, Kuz, and even AB, and Caruso have the potential to drop 15-20+.  

**Defense**

&gt; 1. They have been dangerous on this end and their defense has actually won them more games compared to their offense. **AD is DPOY if he keeps it up. No debate** 

&gt; 2. AD, Dwight, and McGee are a nightmare in the paint to go up against and allow perimeter defenders like KCP, Green, and Caruso to be aggressive in closing out defenders. 

&gt; 3. Lebron has been engaged on that end and this team in general have been great in rotating and communicating. Their perimeter defenders are solid and Caruso is honestly elite on the end. 

&gt; 4.

With today's loss to the Miami Heat we now have a full year of Jim Boylan as Bulls Head Coach to compare statistically. His record over these 82 games is 25 wins and 57 losses (.305). 

Our previous head coach Fred Hoiberg who was fired and replaced by Boylan went 27-55 (.329) in his first year. 

If you check the [historical record](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHI/) of Chicago Bulls statistics you can see that once Phil Jackson left after the 1998 finals victory the bulls have only had 5 seasons over .500. and seven coaches. 

Boylan is a TERRIBLE TERRIBLE coach. Check the final [possession](https://twitter.com/NBCSBulls/status/1203150641423630337?s=20) for our game against golden state. Zach was running an iso play as the clock ran down clearly ready to take the shot and Boylan called a time out... to then come back on court to run an iso play???  Obviously Zach shouldn't have waved off a screen when that was the shot he ended up with, but this is the level of confusion on the court at all times. 

I honestly don't know where the bulls go from here, i swear that apart from maybe the knicks, Gar/Pax are one of the worst front offices in the league. They offered Boylan a contract extension even though the players mutinied against him... players like Zach publically call him out in interviews now etc.  I know it doesn't get much press because the shitty team focus is the Knicks and the other interest is mostly Western Conference but its bad. 

Unless owner Jerry Reinsdorf suddenly decides to overhaul the front office I can't see how the bulls improve? We bring in talent just to squander or release them. its a mess.

Who is the “help?” What does Trae need on this team? Either before the deadline this year or in FA next summer. 

Their core right now is Trae Young and John Collins (suspended). Huerter is a knockdown shooter, Reddish and Hunter are still optimistic questions marks at best. Nobody else on this roster is jumping off your screen. 

This team needs another reliable scorer to take some of the load off Trae’s shoulders. They also need a better center. 

Hassan Whiteside? Marc Gasol on a 1 year deal? Move Collins to the 5 when Whiteside comes out. 

Danilo Gallinari? Marcus Morris? Tyler Johnson? Jordan Clarkson? They need shooters or at least someone who can create their own shot. These guys (somewhat) fit that mold. 

Mo Harkless? Mason Plumlee?

Don’t get me wrong—I figured they would be a top 4 seed in the East and maybe make a move to be an outside ECF team before the season started. After signing an extension for Jaylen Brown (who has also been playing well in a new starting role), and Gordon Hayward looking more like his old self before being sidelined with injuries, it seems the Celtics are in a good position with their roster and money situation to compete for an Eastern Conference championship and finals berth right now.

However, most everyone is aware of the glaring hole Boston has at center. Enes Kanter hasn’t fit well, and it’s tough to find a tolerable defensive matchup for him in the playoffs. Daniel Theis has looked pretty good defensively, but if you’re Boston, you’d really rather him come off the bench.

I think Cody Zeller is the ideal trade candidate to fill the starting center role in Boston. He already has extensive chemistry with Kemba as a longtime teammate and effective pick and roll partner. Come playoff time, this could be a major offensive boon for a young team that struggled finding offense against Milwaukee last year (although a portion of that blame belongs to Kyrie). Zeller has even developed a little as a minor 3 point threat to stretch the defense, shooting 34% on almost 2 attempts a game. His defense isn’t impressive, but not bad enough to be a major liability either—especially with Theis and Robert Williams as backups.

A trade of Enes Kanter, Romeo Langford, and Grant Williams for Zeller works money-wise and offers something for both sides. Boston gets a starting-caliber center who could mesh with the team a little quicker than most candidates due to his familiarity with Kemba Walker. Charlotte gets two rookies who are largely still unknowns and aren’t quite developing at a rate that’s helpful for an immediate contender. They also take on Kanter who hasn’t played much for Boston this year anyway.

There are a few caveats to the quality of this trade. Zeller is injury-prone and Boston may not want to send young pieces and a decent center away for someone who could likely be sidelined at some point, especially considering the injury trouble they’ve already had with Hayward. Also, they might be hesitant to send two recent first round draft picks for a player with only two years left on his contract. On Charlotte’s end, Williams occupies similar floor space to PJ Washington and Miles Bridges (although they will need PF depth if Marvin Williams is dealt this year). Similarly, Romeo Langford would either have to compete for floor space with Dwayne Bacon and Nic Batum, or more likely, spend some time in the G-League this season.

All things considered, though, I think this trade works well for both teams.

There's no sense of a big swing in winning percentage, like in soccer or hockey when one team scores a goal, or even in football or baseball where scores are (comparatively) low so each successful play makes a much bigger difference on the outcome.

I was thinking about radical solutions to this, and the obvious one seemed to be duplicating the last 5 minutes multiples times each game.

Why not score the basketball game like a volleyball or tennis match:
* each period is scored separately, each period starts at 0-0
* teams have to win 3 periods out of 5 to win the game
* the last 5 minutes of every period becomes very important for each team, since the score becomes permanent

Escaping the office with a poor excuse, I strolled into the Spectrum Center, avoided eye contact at all cost and sunk into a 101 section seat that I wasn’t supposed to be in. Hiding a Bullets hat under a gray hoodie and rocking a pair of Jordan 10s, I thought I could just enjoy the game of basketball as an away fan. 

The cold February night was supposed to feature a match-up between Kemba Walker and Bradley Beal. Two guards held back by the talent they were surrounded with were going to battle it out. And as a Wizards fan, everything told me that Bradley Beal was better than Kemba Walker. For the next 8 minutes of game time, I watched a team defeat a group of individuals in a game of basketball. Beal dropped 46 but all that mattered was that Kemba Walker 27 points, 11 assists. Nicolas Batum’s 20 and more importantly, his return to the 2-role while Miles Bridges got the start at the 3 didn’t matter as much. Kemba played well.

For all of the 2018-19 season, it was about Kemba’s free agency value—not the recognition of the Charlotte Hornets’ development of something different. This piece is going to contain a lot of conversation about Kemba and I hate it. Because to talk about why this team is one piece away, I have to talk about how Kemba wasn't as important on the court. I have to talk about how a team that was originally built around him and his style didn't need Walker to actually run said style. A team that prepared for his departure still suffers the stench that came with him being on the team for so long. 

Kemba Walker wasn’t an easy player to build around. It took him a while to develop his style in the association. Coming out of college, he was known for his highlights and his ‘cardiac Kemba moments’—even though I personally prefer to call him a crafty opportunistic guard, searching for comfort behind the arch. When the lights were at their brightest, he shined, it doesn't mean that the lights were shining all of the time.


When he entered the league, he was still as raw as could be. His shooting splits were poor, it felt as he was searching for guidance from someone else rather than creating his own way.


But on October 30, 2014, the Charlotte Hornets decided to take the risk.  After being a key member of the 2013-14 playoff team, he would be rewarded. They would extend Walker for his upside and would take the gamble of building a team around the young guard, with the hopes that he can turn on the lights in Charlotte.


It was a shame that the team never truly figured out what they needed to be. At glimpses, it felt that the team needed to develop around the arch—taking advantage of Kemba Walker’s ability to penetrate. Other times, it just felt as if the team was building around the two-man game—pairing Kemba Walker with the likes of Al Jefferson, Bismack Biyombo and Dwight Howard, with the occasional outside looks. 


The lack of definition wouldn’t get answered for sometime, experimentation simply lived on while Kemba Walker reaped the benefits of little-to-no expectations of team success but all of the credit for his personal success. Over time, the front office searched for answers. The city was puzzled, searching for hope. 


The Summer of 2017 provided that. Malik Monk and Dwayne Bacon would join the team at what felt were steal values. the team would trade for Willy Hernangomez and quietly, they would become one of the youngest teams in the NBA. There was a light at the end of the tunnel. The organization was ready for the change--Rich Cho and Steve Clifford were gone, a new front office was built and it seemed like the fresh start needed.

A team that was years in the making finally, existed. There was meaning to the team. 

There were three things that we learned last season about the Hornets:

1. Nicolas Batum wasn’t a Small Forward—even though he had been telling us this for some time and the Hornets coaching staff didn’t care. He’s an oversized shooting guard. This move allowed a lot of flexibility not in just who could be the 1 but how they could develop out the 3-role.

2. The team needed to be effective from behind the arch—they went from 27.2 3-point attempts per game to 33.9 attempts per game and utilized their perimeter based system.

3.  The team didn’t need Kemba Walker

The team progressed in a lot of different aspects. Different looks with Tony Parker, Devonte’ Graham, Malik Monk guiding the offense provided flexibility—something that had been missing since the last time Jeremy Lin was on the roster. 

It was also the style of offense without Walker that was appealing. Walker is so reliant on his handles opening the court that at times, we forget how pleasant it is for passing to open the offense. His score first mentality at times would rejuvenate a crowd but other times, a guard setting-up his teammate for the moment. He ranked 18th among guards in assist per game, assist % and double-doubles among guards—which was kind of surprising given is 31.5% usage rate, 6th among guards in 2018-19. He scored points—25.6 per game, 1.25 points per shot and took the second most shots by a guard (1684), which I guess explains it. 


The point, I guess, is that it feels like any guard could have been in that system and succeeded. If you’re getting the opportunities to take a lot of shot, if you’re working with a take on the two-man game that opens you up for a shot while others remain around the arch and space the floor extremely, it feels like most guards would love that system and most above-average guards would flourish in said system.

I don’t think anyone is surprised that Kemba Walker left and it felt like Charlotte has known for sometime. It developed a system where someone could come in and pick-up the slack or possibly develop others. It also explains their drafting decision in 2019—PJ Washington, Jaden McDaniels, two terrific scorers and Cody Martin, who showed offensive potential at Nevada. They didn't go after a fresh point guard out of college.

Devonte’ Graham stepped up this season, filling the role Walker provided for so long and the role Terry Rozier hasn’t proven he can handle just yet. His ability to create on the drive was something Kemba never really sought—Kemba liked being a score-first guy on the drive—but [Graham has been great about doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nst8UQGIInU)—especially with the potential from three this team has. The team averages the 7th most made three’s a game and averages 35.5 attempts from behind the arch per game. Even better, Devonte’ himself has been incredible from three. So don’t just say Devonte’ is ‘Baby Kemba,’ he may be better. 


As a team, they’re much more sharing—going from 57.8% of field goals being assisted to 62.5% They’re also trusting their play behind the arch—we already talked about more attempts but 37.1% of their points are coming from deep. 

This team does have a lot of flaws. They are running a two-man game with a focus around the arch—similar to the Wizards offense back in 2017-18—so a lot of times, Rozier or Graham will bring up the ball and be met with a high screen while the remaining forwards sit in the corner. The remaining member trails, stopping at the arch--bracing for the outlet past or long rebound. And with how much this team likes to penetrate and pass, it leads to a lot of turnovers. Its a fatal flaw to the system because at times, you could get a killer shot alone win the corner or the ball gets thrown away because of a tough pass.

In games were the team loses, they’re actually getting the same amount of shots off, shooting extremely similar numbers from the field, but are shooting but are just 3.8% worse from three and are averaging 4.4 more turnovers a game. The system is flawed, its a live by the system and die by the system. Charlotte, unfortunately, has had to deal with a lot of games where Rozier is forced to make an extremely contested bucket or an extremely difficult outlet pass only few are able to do it on a consistent basis. This also doesn’t exclude games where Graham and Rozier don’t perform or have an off-night. Last night’s game against Atlanta was an unfortunate reminder that sometimes, a player simply cannot get buckets.


I would also be remiss if I didn’t say Charlotte’s defense still sucks. Kemba Walker’s departure hasn’t changed the lack of strength in the paint. They still cannot get a defensive rebound, don’t force turnovers, don’t contest when they turn it over and more importantly, aren’t being aggressive when they do try to contest a tough shot. Opponents shoot 48.8% on them but it goes relatively unnoticed as time of possession is often drawn out against them. Its still bad, nothing has changed, I just wanted to have that on the record. 

The Hornets are doing their best to remind everyone that they don’t need Kemba—they can still be entertaining, they can still show glimpses of being great and can still have a mediocre record. As the team matures, as the holes in the line-up become more defined, the system will become more efficient. The loss of Walker isn’t affecting the roster as hard as once though and it shouldn’t have been a surprise. 

As you give players more reps, they’re often to show better performances. Walker was a usage beast that took advantage on the opportunities given to him in Charlotte—it doesn’t mean it was the right thing for that team. Now with his departure, Miles Bridges, Devonte’ Graham, Malik Monk [(when he is actually played)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_HPWlmENzg) can showcase what they’re able to do. I don’t think PJ Washington would be seeing the bursts he has been if Walker is running that team. 


As a Maryland boy, I’m not supposed to say nice things about a team from North Carolina but here we are. An organization once considered to be the joke in the league is now one piece away from finally contending in the east. The search for their much needed dominant big man is a journey most have never been able to answer.

He is currently averaging 16/11/3 on 44/37/88 (61.1 TS%). These are very good numbers and offensively he could be a really nice piece for a team. The issues come when we look at his defense. He is a man without a position on that end. He is to slow to defend on the perimeter as a 4 and not good enough protecting the rim to play the 5. So realistically the team he goes to needs to either have a mobile 5 or a great rim protector.

First trade- http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=rv938go

Cavs receive: James Johnson, Kelly Olynyk, Derick Jones Jr and Duncan Robinson

Heat receive: Kevin Love and Ante Zizic

The reason the Cavs do this trade is they get off of the last 2 years of Loves contract and they get 2 young wing prospects in Robinson and Jones. Also Olynyk can play for them and help develop the young guards. It really just comes down to saving money and getting Robinson though for CLE.

The reason the Heat do this trade is because they upgrade of offense a lot by putting Love in the Olynyk/Leonard role on offense. Bam is basically the perfect fit next to Love because he is so versatile on defense. If this team stays healthy I think they would have a punchers chance in the East.

Overall I would not do this trade if I was MIA because it really kills there future cap space aspirations and I don’t think it makes them good enough to get out of the East. Also I am really high on Duncan Robinson and would have a hard time dealing him.

Second trade- http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=sdkqk38

Cavs receive: Tyler Johnson, Dario Saric, Elie Okobo and a 2023 second

Suns receive: Kevin Love

The main reason the Cavs do this trade is because they get off of the last 3 years of Loves contract and get Saric. If the Cavs are high on Saric and see him as a real piece for the future then I think they jump all over this. Okobo has shown flashes this year and Johnson can add some toughness that they desperately need.

The reason the Suns do this is because it elevates them into one of the best offenses in the NBA. Love is a decent fit next to Ayton because Ayton is better and prefers to play on the perimeter defensively. They will still probably struggle a lot on that end though but the offense would be really hard to stop when everyone is healthy. The Suns are desperate to make the playoffs after how bad the last few years have been and this would help. Losing Johnson would hurt but Carter could potentially take over his role. The only major asset the Suns are giving up is future cap space.

Again I probably would not do this trade if I was the Suns but I understand why they would. Loves contract is not going to age that great because he is already not very athletic but it would make them really fun and better for this season.

The leagues obviously going through a ratings crisis at the moment and one aspect is the structure of the regular season. Adam Silver seems to be trying to change things; one major proposal is the mid season tournament.

I’m all for arguing about the possible success or features of the tournament but I see so many people dismissing it on a general basis of ‘it won’t mean anything’ or ‘players won’t care’. When we talk about ‘value’ so much of it comes down to what we all agree on and assign to something. Put simply, the universe doesn’t assign value we do. 

So to simply dismiss the tournament is a bit redundant. Instead it is more useful to look at the factors that would give the tournament value. First and foremost; under the right circumstances would it be good basketball to watch. 

Personally I like the idea of the tournament featuring the mid-table teams. I think the top tier teams are really showcased in the playoffs but watching teams like the Suns compete against other teams in the 6-8 region. The tournament may well hold MORE value to up and coming stats instead off veterans like Harden. With the volatility of a knockout format that could be great to watch. 

Overall, saying the tournament won’t work may very well be a SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY because it will not assign it any value. + good on Adam Silver for tying to innovate.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,72601,public,self,Adam Silver appreciation post,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/e7tqz0/adam_silver_appreciation_post/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also know that the narratives around the candidates can sometimes dictate the outcome more than the actual play of those players. So I want to discuss can a player in the modern era of basketball win the MVP without being one of the leading scorers in the league.

Steve Nash is the clear outlier in this case, as he won MVP back to back seasons while scoring 15.5 and 18.8 PPG while having double digit assists and being one of the most efficient players in the NBA. Nash was the floor general team who averaged the most PPG in the NBA by over 7 points per game in 2005 and by over 6 points per game.

However the era of basketball Nash and the suns were playing in is much different than it is today. The 2005 Suns would’ve been tied 20th in PPG last season and 2006 would’ve been 22nd in the league. The 2005 and 2006 Suns would’ve been dead last in possessions per game last season. This is not to discredit the Suns at all, because they’re small ball roster is the reason why we seen teams play so up tempo. But this is to say that the early and mid 2000’s was a much more defensive game than it is today, which is why Nash was able to win the award with such low scoring totals.

The real reason why I don’t think somebody could win MVP with such low point totals is the story. It would be very difficult for the media to push a MVP candidate with such low scoring totals, and the modern fan wouldn’t rally around a guy who wants a highlight show. Twitter and Instagram loves big dunks and deep three pointers. Scoring gets likes and follows, brings more attention to a player. 

James Harden is the perfect definition of what a narrative can do for a player. You can make a very strong argument that the narratives around Harden’s defense and playstyle has prohibited him from winning another MVP. You can make strong arguments that LeBron James hasn’t won a more MVPs because there isn’t a very strong narrative to ride because of his coasting, even though he’s been the undisputed best player in the league since his first ring. Unless said below 20 PPG scorer was leading a team like the Knicks to 50-60 wins and was putting up crazy highlights I doubt they’d get enough media attention to be in the running.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,72596,public,self,Will there ever be another NBA MVP who doesn’t average 20 or more PPG,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/e7q3r9/will_there_ever_be_another_nba_mvp_who_doesnt/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All 6 of these guys are tough covers.

But since the Rockets switch 1-4, that could negate off-ball movement of guys like Porzingis and Bogdanovic. In isolation I think Harden is a very good defender; he’s got quick hands for getting strips in the post, he’s got sufficient lateral quickness, and he’s obviously as strong as an ox.

Since the Rockets’ guards are seemingly their most valuable players(Harden Brodie, the ever reliable playoff performer EG, BMac the shooter and Rivers who’s play in isolation D and O makes him a pretty solid playoff contributor); is Harden playing the PF defensively the best way for the Rockets to play more 4-guard lineups?

Here's the proper fix.

16 teams make the playoffs.  Top 7 teams get to draft which opponent (8-16) they want to play in the first round.  1 seed has first pick, 2nd seed gets second pick and so on and so forth.

The NBA can make an hour special out of this.  It would give fans and all the talking heads something interesting to talk about before the playoffs begin.

Round 2, same thing happens.  Teams ranked 1-3 get to choose who they want to play in the second round.

This makes being a fan of those second and third tier teams much more interesting with teams fighting for that 7th seed.  It also puts pressure on players like Kawhi Leonard not to rest too many games as seeding now matters.

It's fairly common knowledge that Michael Jordan is considered the best basketball player to ever live. And obviously, I agree that he more than deserves to be in the discussion. But what I've begun to question is the way we have given MJ the benefit of the doubt in essentially every argument against him. It's like he can do no wrong. I have a couple theories as to why that is:

Michael Jordan is the most successfully marketed player in history.

His shoes alone are a testament to this. They are a cultural phenomenon to this day. They are SO highly coveted and sought after that they are no longer primarily used for their original purpose: basketball shoes. They're worn to flex. Scuffing or dirtying them in any way is like a mortal sin. Anyone with that kind of notoriety is bound to receive potentially unwarranted praise. Some may argue that he's this successful BECAUSE he was so great, and I would agree if marketing him started after his career ended. Advertisements affect everyone whether they like it or not, and I believe this has a significant effect on how we see him now.

He played in an era without social media.

This, of course, applies to everyone who may be in the discussion for GOAT who didn't play with social media around. MJ didn't have to live with every slip, blunder, and mistake blown up on every social media site imaginable. We don't have instant access to the mistakes he made, so it's as if he made none. And he's been considered the GOAT for so long now, that even when mistakes are brought up, they're glossed over. MJ was not the best 3 point shooter. He lost a lot of playoff games that weren't the Finals, which brings me to my most important point.

MJ is given too much credit for having the most rings without a series lost in the Finals.

The first question when it comes to the GOAT is almost never simply ""Who is the greatest of all time?"", it's usually ""With the game on the line, you get one player to lead your team. Who do you take?"" or something along those lines. This question does not make sense to me, and ultimately, it's ignorant of most of what makes a basketball player great. The fact that a few key moments in a player's career can be used to argue for the entirety of their career is foolish. Shouldn't we be talking about, you know, their whole career? The ""clutch gene"" is bogus, quite frankly, because it effectively ignores the entirety of the rest of the players and the events of the game. Basketball is a team game. Plain and simple. I'm of the opinion that an individual player's greatness should be measured by their individual impact. And wins, while definitely, definitely important, are given far too much weight. Players like John Stockton, Karl Malone, Charles Barkley, and Elgin Baylor should be held to a slightly lower standard because of their lack of rings, but they also should not by any means be overlooked for their impact. It's easy to define the GOAT as one who didn't flinch in clutch moments, but that ignores far too many factors.

MJ is the best scorer of all time, probably the most exciting player to ever play, one of if not the best dunkers of all time, one of the best defenders of all time, and so many other insane things. This post was not meant to be a hating session. I just want a larger discussion when it comes to discussing who was the best.

&amp;#x200B;

MJ is great in his own right for countless reasons, but he may not be the GOAT because of how he was marketed, the era he played in, and the way his status as GOAT is argued",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,72529,public,self,The Greatest Of All Time,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/e7ao23/the_greatest_of_all_time/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So far Chris Paul is have a really strong year putting up 15/4/6/2 with 45/38/87 (59..5 TS%). To go along with Paul’s efficient offense he has been incredible defensively especially considering his age. His IQ and motor on defense has really impressed. 

Westbrook has struggled mightily on the other hand. Statistically so far his numbers are 22/8/7/2 with 40/22/74 (47.7!!! TS%). Westbrook is playing with one of the best offensive players in the NBA and the most spacing he has (ever?) had and is still playing awful on offense even while Harden is getting so much attention. Teams are ignoring him and sending 2 guys at Harden consistently. His defense has been at best below average this year and when you play next to Harden you need to really bring it on that end because Harden is not going to put in the effort.

On top of the Rockets giving up 2 firsts + 2 pick swaps they took on an additional year of salary with Westbrook’s contract (47 million in his final year).

In sum the rockets gave up 2 firsts, 2 pick swaps and Chris Paul for Westbrook and his extra year under contract where he’ll make 47 million.

Both signed for 4 years / $85 million this summer.

I first off cannot believe that no team tried harder to land Brogdon. He was flawless last year and deserved at least $100 mil. And there’s not a single team/ style of play that he wouldn’t fit into and immediately raise the level. First team that comes to mind is Philly, who I will never understand what inspired them to max their 4th or 5th best player. Did they not consider that Brogdon would round out their starting lineup to perfection at half the price? this basically applies to every big fish (LAL, DAL, HOU) it just does not make sense that they let Indiana steal an all star.  

And how are Kings fans supposed to feel about Harrison Barnes?  What exactly is the point of giving him that kind of money, especially from a rebuilding team? His best role was w Golden State: as the 5th best player that never had to create offense. He has this incredible reputation, and I’m not sure if there’s a reason for it other than him being a #1 overall recruit and everyone raving about his character. And teams just accept that and pay him like he “deserves” while players who bring similar if not more value (Marcus Smart, Covington) go for half the price. He didn’t deserve to be on the Olympic team, and he doesn’t deserve to have over double the career earnings of Lou Will.

And again it is not ment for the normal working, basketball loving people,

You get a terrible seat for that price as you can imagine. In the US the ticket price for approximatly the same seats with the same matchup (bucks-hornets) are around 22 dollars...smh.   
Just like the London games, somehow the organisations main target is to attract top soccer athletes and celebs to these games. Mostly people that dont even contribute to the game or its popularity in Europe in any way whatsoever!  
Meanwhile, the people that play the game, breath the game, follow the league and games every night get left out.

I can imagine for example being a greek immigrant in one of the western european countries or wanting to drive to Paris to see Giannis play and they hit you with the ticket price like that.

That's right, James Harden. 

Now I know that you can't compare players soley based of off one particular similar offensive skill, however, like Luka, James is not particularly athletic and uses his craftiness to score points. Harden, someone who is bases his game of the step-back 3, wasn't barely even shooting it at the same clip when he was Luka's age. 

Just the way both players use their bodies as shields while driving to the basket and their step-back 3s gives me the inclination that Luka's floor as a player is Harden and his ceiling is sky-high given the fact that his skillset at age 20 is a lot more polished that what Harden's was.

Is there some schematic fix to this that falls on the hands of Brett Brown? Is this an issue of personnel that will need to be addressed via trade if they want a legitimate championship shot?

I was listening to Ben Taylors podcast on Kobe vs Wade Vs Harden and he talks a lot about scalability or portability in the pod. For those who haven't listened to Taylor before the basic definition of scalability is how well does a player fit alongside other stars to help create a championship level roster. Most championships are won with at least two stars, so this an important trait for any player who wants to ever win a ring. 


The main factors in scalability are typically shooting, cutting, rebounding, defense, and off ball passing. Essentially everything you would do when you don't have the ball in your hands. Typically defense is more important for big men, while shooting more important for guards. Good scaleable players can fit in on different teams and can help raise an already good team to a great team, kind of like a ceiling raiser. These are players that can be key parts of elite playoff offenses and defenses.


After listening to the pod I thought to make a list of what I think are the most scalable superstars in the game today. **This is not meant to be a list of the best players right now**. Being more scalable doesn't necessarily make you a better player than someone who is less. It just means that you can fit in and be valuable on more teams. People might disagree with that idea but thats my take on it. 


**Top 15 List**


**1. Kevin Durant**

This is really based off his play last year, we're not sure how he will be when he comes back obviously. I think Durant's ability to join seamlessly with an already all time great team in Golden State and make them better in the postseason is the best example of scalability that you can make. People rightfully criticize durant's move to golden state, but what is undeniable is how seamlessly he was able to fit in with their team. This is a big credit to steph curry as well, but Durant deserves this top ranking in my eyes because of his incredibly versatile game. Durant proved he could play alongside another ball dominant star in westbrook for years as well. Though those OKC team never won a ring, they were always one of the best teams in the league offensively and defensively, and durant's ability to play off ball was a big reason why westbrook was able to thrive at times.

Durant provides elite level 3pt shooting, elite level mid range shooting, and elite driving ability. Durant put up career passing numbers in Golden State, he can pass the ball extremely well for a power forward. He can come off of screens for mid rangers, and also pass out of the low post. He was one of the best transition players in the league. He improved largely as a defender, he guarded both harden and lebron in the postseason, and acted as a secondary rim protecter. Towards the end of his tenure he became a little more stagnant in his iso's and low post play, but I think he proved during the tenure that he can fit in and elevate just about any team that hes playing on offensively while being a plus on defense. 


**2. Anthony Davis**

Personally I feel like Davis isn't getting enough credit for how he's been able to fit in alongside Lebron. Davis is the most versatile big in the game today considering both offense and defense. He's putting together a DPOY level performance this year and anchoring one of the leagues best defenses. He can swallow perimeter players while being the best shot blocker the league at the rim. He can play both the 4 and the 5 defensively and offensively giving his team a lot of options. Offensively he is the best roll man in the league, he gives you the lob threat of a rim running, with the great hands, finishing, and post moves of more traditional big. Hes a putback monster and a great rebounder. He has a decent mid range game. While his shooting from three isn't amazing, he does have enough shooting to keep defenses honest. Hes showing he can be a part of an top offense and defense on one of the best teams in the league, and hes doing this alongside one of the more ball dominant players in lebron. his passing is also underrated for his position, hes been improving the last two years and is above average for his position. I think most people would agree Davis is one of the easiest players to slot in alongside any superstar that would improve the team drastically.


**3. Kawhi Leonard**

Kawhi has shown on two separate teams now that he can take them to extremely high heights and win a ring. On the spurs in he led two dominant regular season teams in 15-16 and 16-17 and had great postseason runs on both team.s On the raps he joined an already great team and took them to a new height winning a ring. Kawhis ability to be an elite defender, shooter, and driver allow him to take great teams to elite level. He can change playoff series with his defensive ability, and his scoring is versatile enough to fit in alongside other players. Hes not as versatile as someone like durant or Paul George in terms of coming off screens to score but he is capable. He can run pick and roll, tho his passing leaves something to be desired tho hes improving. His elite shooting, finishing, and post game gives him a lot of versatility and then his defensive dominance and ability to raise already great teams in the postseason give him the nod for me here tho. Similar to the players above him, its difficult to conceive a team where Kawhi doesn't fit in almost perfectly. 


**4. Steph Curry**

Alongside Durant, Curry deserves an immense amount of praise for his ability to play alongside other stars. He's the premier off ball superstar, essentially a superman kyle korver. His ability to warp defenses was the lynchpin of the greatest offenses ever created in golden state. Curry coming off a screen requires a double team which opens up everyone else offensively. He can also operate on ball extremely well in the pick and roll and is a good passer for his position. Curry doesnt get enough credit for how great of a driver and finisher he is at the rim either. He get knocked down a few pegs because of his defense, though he isn't as bad as someone like Harden in my opinion. However his lack of defensive versatility does create some lineup issues. We likely would've seen this in golden state this year with dlo. While offensively the team likely would've hummed along, Currys ability to fit in alongside another weak defender in the backcourt is questionable. However his incredible offensive scaling is too hard to ignore so I had to put him here. 


**5. Paul George**


Paul George is a very similar player to Kawhi in a lot of ways. One of the best defensive wings in the game that can guard 2-4 and is a good rebounder for his position. I view him as a better off ball shooter than Kawhi but I think overall his offensive game is a little less well rounded. Hes not the offensive rebounder kawhi is and doesn't have quite the same pedigree of raising teams to that top end level. He's good in the pick and roll and a decent passer as well, but not as good as durant in my opinion. I think where George shines is coming off screens compared to Kawhi. Overall I think hes similar to these players though where adding him on just about any team raises their ceiling substantially and his ability to fit alongside another ball dominant player is good. This season on the clippers will be a good test to see how he can fit in on a championship level team. 


**6. Lebron James**


I think this will be controversial but I think Lebron gets maligned a bit too much for his portability. Yes, he is one of the most ball dominant superstars in the history of the game, but outside of providing elite level spacing he does everything on the floor extremely well. He showed he can be a part of elite level defenses in miami and on the lakers now. He can guard a multitude of positions and acts as a secondary rim protector. Offensively, he doesn't provide the spacing but hes one of the best cutters in league history. He is not nearly as lazy off ball as someone like Westbrook or harden, he does cut often. He is also a willing screener. He ran countless pick and roll with Kyrie in cleveland which was one of their most effective plays. He actually is a lob threat on these plays as well. He can act as a super man draymond green on the pick and roll as the roll man with his absurd passing ability on these short rolls. He is probably the best transition player of all time both with the ball in his hands and while running the wing. He has a post game and can pass out of the post. He is a great offensive and defensive rebounder when he crashes the boards. 


He has played with other ball dominant superstars in wade and kyrie. While the fit with Wade is an example of diminishing returns, both of their ability to make it work to create high level playoff offenses does show his versatility. With Kyrie, together they authored the best playoff offenses ever seen. I think because he does hold the ball so much these other parts of his game are diminished, but hes easily one of the most versatile offensive players we've seen. His shooting is maligned, but it is servicable enough. His presence on top offenses virtually his entire career with a variety of spacing, ball handling, and big men is a testament to this in my eyes.


**7. Karl Anthony Towns**


KAT is the next evolution of the NBA big. Offensively he's probably the best version of a big you can get in todays game. Hes a hyper efficient inside scorer while being the best big man shooter in the league. Hes scoring as efficiently as miami lebron while having a diverse diet of shot selection. He can pass well for his position, score in the post, pick and pop, pick and roll, spot up, virtually whatever you want. Hes a good rebounder as well. His defense is the biggest concern essentially. Hes done nothing to show yet he can anchor a top defense, which is very important for his position. Offensively I think if you put him with another offensive star they could create an absurd offense and synergize, however his defensive potential as a 5 slacks behind everyone else on this list so I have to hold him back. 


**8. Joel Embiid**


Embiid is an interesting example, he's kind of like the inverse of KAT. While KAT is an offensive machine, Embiid is the defensive monster. He could likely slot into any team and turn that team into a competent defensive squad. He isnt as versatile defensively as someone like Anthony Davis, but he doesn't have to be because hes going to be always playing the 5. Embiid on the surface doesn't appear that scalable, because of his mediocre outside shooting, and he doesn't have that diverse of an offensive game. However I think his ability to raise virtually any defense to an elite level and his top level rebounding gives him big pluses for me. Offensively while he operates a lot through the post, he does a good face up game and can be a pick and roll partner. He does have a good mid range game for a center and is somewhat of a passer tho he can be a bit of a turnover machine.


**9. Jimmy Butler**

Butler is a similar wing in some ways to PG and Kawhi, though he gives much less deep shooting while giving much more playmaking. Defensively hes shown he can be a key part of great defensive teams which is a big bonus. Offensively he can fit in off ball as a cutter and coming off screens, but it does feel as though hes best with the ball in his hands. He is extremely unselfish, doesn't command the ball and demonstrated he can be a part of top level teams on the wolves, Philly, and Miami alongside other great players. His lack of elite 3pt shooting holds him back a bit but I think hes a player that can make it work with other great players. 

**10. Giannis **

Giannis is undeniably a top 3 player in the game right now, but hes does have some serious portability concerns. His lack of shooting is obviously the biggest issue, however he's similar to lebron that he does virtually everything else extremely well. He can help to anchor one of the best defenses in the league, but he does require to either play with a stretch 5 or stretch 4, at even more extreme level than someone like lebron. He can similarly play as the roll man and play the pick and roll. He is a theoretically a good cutter but I'm not sure how much he does it since he's not on the perimeter as much. He requires you to play an offensive system similar to that of someone like Lebron but doesn't quite give you as much offensive versatility as Lebron does. That being said his dominant defensive potential as well as rebounding is enough to allow him to contribute even if he causes some offensive issues. I think Giannis does have the potential to play more exclusively at the 5 which would give him a lot more versatility in playing more as a traditional big, all of which he does really well. Then he could run pick and roll with a dominant ball handler while being spread out with shooters where he could be one of the best roll men in the league. 

**11. Nikola Jokic**


Jokic is one of the most unique bigs we've seen in the game. He has a versatile offensive scoring game from the post and is the best big passer possibly ever. However his lack of defensive ability is a hole compared to other bigs. He is a decent floor spacer but not reliable this year. He can lead a top offense with his passing ability but I'm not sure how he'd fit in with another ball dominant guard that likes running traditional pick and roll. He works well with cutting guards and shooters around him and is a great post player. His lack of rim running does hurt him a bit. But a lot of this action does require him to hold the ball. Defensively Denver has put together great defenses around him, but this feels like its more despite him than because of him. Lack of defensive versatility puts him down a few pegs for me even with his diverse offensive game.


**12. Luka Doncic**

Its getting tough to deny that Doncic is a bonafide superstar. Doncic doesn't have much tape playing alongside another star so a lot of this will need to be conjecture. Doncic plays somewhat like a hybrid of Lebron and Harden. The iso and step back shooting of harden, with the absurd spread pick and roll passing of Lebron. He is the evolution of the Harden/lebron/westbrook/oscar archetype, the pick and roll maestro that will command the ball nearly every possession but lead incredible offenses. An incredible offensive mastermind, but similar to those players who command the ball on nearly every possession its not sure how hed fit in alongside other stars. He's not the cutter or screener that lebron is, nor the defender. He provides much better spacing, but isnt necessarily an elite floor spacer yet. Playing alongside another ball dominant star could lead to the Harden/CP3 your turn my turn dynamic we saw in Houston. Similar to Harden/Lebron/Giannis, this likely doesn't matter because he can lead an elite offense by himself, but it doesn't necessarily make him the most portable. His lack of elite defensive ability puts him down a few notches compared to the rest of the list.


**13/14 Kyrie Irving/Dame Lillard**


Two very similar players, Kyrie and Dame are on star PGs that provide elite spacing and driving ability. Both can come off screens but typically operate best out of the pick and roll. Its possible I'm undervaluing their shooting here, since they're both two of the best shooters in the league. But outside of shooting they don't provide virtually any of the other great values of scalable players. Kyrie has fit in with lebron, and his great floor spacing was crucial to lebrons drive and kick game. But his lack of defensive ability always hurt, and he's not particularly active off ball compared to someone like Curry. Essentially these two feel like more ball dominant versions of curry with worse shooting, which hurts them in this regard. 


**15. James Harden**

Before the houston fans kill me I think harden is much better than half this list, however this is solely about portability and scalability. Harden's issues in my eyes is he does virtually nothing without the ball in his hands. He is a good shooter, but hes not necessarily elite as a spot up shooter. Hes a poor defender, Houston has to essentially switch everything to cover for him at times. His fit alongside CP3 was the most extreme example of his turn my turn I've ever seen, even more extreme than other super star ball dominant pairings like LBJ/wade and LBJ/Kyrie. He almost never moves off ball due to his extreme offensive load. He is possibly one of the best floor raisers we've ever seen, but the way he changes other players role around him is like the criticism of LBJ but to an even more extreme. He's shown he can be a part of all time great teams like Houston in these past two years, but those teams were created to be the best possible team that fit around his strengths. And they were championship level teams, but that doesnt make him a portable player. He doesn't provide any synergy with other great players really. 


And thats it. Hope you guys enjoyed reading this. Took a while to type up but was fun. Please let me know how you respectfully agree/disagree. **reminder this isn't a list of who's the best or worst, just more portable**.

Many teams were entire states, but for more densely populated areas they split states up into multiple teams. For instance, California had two entrants split upon geographic lines. 

I wanted to take this a step further, so I started with their rosters and implemented my own 'All-Area Teams' tournament where I listed all rosters and used FiveThirtyEight's method to quantify how many games a team would be projected to win in an NBA season to rank them in terms of quality. I don't think it will surprise anyone that 'Southern California' came out as the top team with a projected 70 wins, but some of the teams will surprise. In general, the midwest has several strong teams and there is an extreme drought of NBA production in states just west of the Mississippi until you get to the coast. 

Indiana has just 2% of the US population yet has produced 4.5% of all non-international NBA players this season, perhaps justifying their claim as the basketball capitol of the world.

I have always felt this to be true since Nike has taken over.

No longer can I watch a highlight at a glance and know who is playing, who is the home team, who is the road team.  That matters because with all the player movement now, fans are most allegiant to their franchise, which is represented by a piece of laundry.  It sounds small but over time that erodes brand recognition.

I find myself watching NBA highlights and taking longer than in the past to recognize the teams AND the players because of Nikes drive to sell more jerseys.  Sure, we can look at the score graphic, but in youtube highlight videos, alternate angles, or replays those indicators wont be there.

Also, when the road team is white (not always, but mostly), that is also problematic for recognition purposes.  If the home team was white, the court serves as an initial indicator.  Road teams wearing white removes their identity (which I guess is the purpose but hurts recognizability).

     - 45.4% FG/31.3% 3PT/81.6% FT (57.2% TS)

Dame is killing it so far this year despite his team's struggles; not only is he scoring well, he's also taking great care of the ball (7.3 APG to just 2.7 TO/G); Beal is leading one of the top offenses in the league, and is pretty much singlehandedly keeping the Wizards within reach of the playoffs; Siakam has filled Kawhi's role wonderfully as the #1 option on the Raptors, who look like they've barely missed a beat; AD is looking like arguably the best defender in the league and is pouring in the points on offense as well; and Embiid, even with some bad games here and there [(cough cough 0 point game)](https://www.nba.com/images/cms/2019-11/gasol-embiid.jpg?cw=1920&amp;w=2651&amp;x=346&amp;ch=1080&amp;h=2086&amp;y=0), is still showing that he's an elite 2-way player.

     - 41.6% FG/26.1% 3PT/86.8% FT (56.5% TS)

     - 53.9% FG/0.0% 3PT/62.9% FT (56.1% TS)

Trae Young is looking like one of the most dangerous offensive players in the league; if he can work on his defense and turning the ball over less, he could easily make his way higher up this list; Devin Booker and the Suns got off to a scorching hot start, and while they've both cooled off since, Booker is still putting up 50/40/90 and the Suns still have a playoff spot; Butler hasn't been shooting the greatest from the field, but his ability to get to the line has kept his efficiency above average, and he's also one of the best players in the league [according to several advanced metrics, including 538's RAPTOR;](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-nba-player-ratings/) Brandon Ingram is a legitimate Most Improved Player candidate, and the mini-KD comparisons are seeming more and more accurate as he continues to light up the scoreboard; and Drummond has been an absolute monster on the boards, as he's [currently on pace for the highest single season DRB% ever](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/drb_pct_season.html) and is also on pace for the [2nd highest single season total RB% ever.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/trb_pct_season.html)

*Honorable Mention:* 

- Malcolm Brogdon, G, Indiana Pacers
- Kawhi Leonard, F, Los Angeles Clippers
- Paul George, F, Los Angeles Clippers (*really considered putting him on the 3rd team, but opted for Butler since PG has only played 11 games*)

#**NBA Awards**#

**NBA MVP**

*Note: This is who I personally believe is having the best season, not necessarily the order I think the voters are most likely to choose*

1. James Harden
2. Giannis Antetokounmpo
3. Luka Doncic
4. LeBron James

IMO this is extremely close to a 4-way tie; every one of these guys has an argument for MVP.  But Harden's historic scoring volume along with his efficiency gives him the nod, in my view.  Could possibly give an honorable mention to Anthony Davis or even KAT, but these four are far and away the best right now.

**Defensive Player of the Year**

1. Anthony Davis
2. Giannis Antetokounmpo
3. Rudy Gobert
4. Jonathan Isaac
5. Marcus Smart

**Most Improved Player**

1. Devonte Graham
2. Fred VanVleet
3. Pascal Siakam
4. Luka Doncic
5. Brandon Ingram
6. Malcolm Brogdon
7. Jaylen Brown
8. Andrew Wiggins
9. Bam Adebayo
10. Trae Young

This one was really hard to do, hence why I have ten players listed.  I had a tough time choosing an exact criteria for ""most improved;"" should it go to a player who hasn't had a big role before and is having a ""break out"" season?  Or should it go to any player who has improved dramatically?  In the end I kind of went with both.  Devonte Graham has pretty much undeniably improved the most, going from 4.7 PPG/1.4 RPG/2.6 APG last season to 18.0 PPG/3.5 RPG/7.7 APG so far this year.  VanVleet and Siakam have both thrived in their expanded roles; Doncic has a similar role to last year and was already really good, but has still improved so much that I think he deserves to be on here (similar to Steph Curry finishing 4th in 2015-16 despite winning MVP that year and the year before).  Also a shoutout to Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who has an argument to be on this list as well.

**6th Man of the Year**

1. Montrezl Harrell (F, Los Angeles Clippers)
2. Lou Williams (G, Los Angeles Clippers)
3. Derrick Rose (G, Detroit Pistons)
4. Goran Dragic (G, Miami Heat)

*Honorable Mention:*

- Moritz Wagner (F, Washington Wizards)
- Davis Bertans (F, Washington Wizards)
- Bogdon Bogdonovic (G, Sacramento Kings)
- Dennis Schroder (G, Oklahoma City Thunder)

**Rookie of the Year**

1. Ja Morant
2. Eric Paschall
3. Kendrick Nunn

Other rookies could easily find themselves in the mix for this too, but these three are ahead of the pack IMO.

**Coach of the Year**

1. Nick Nurse, Raptors
2. Monty Williams, Suns
3. Erik Spoelstra, Heat
4. Mike Malone, Nuggets
5. Rick Carlisle, Mavericks

TBH I don't know a whole lot about this award, so I don't know if this is a very good list.  Nurse seems like a good choice though

Down one-point and under the basket, the play call appeared to get a simple shot either under the basket or feed it to RJ Barrett who was streaking into the corner. Leonard Hamilton’s team collapsed towards the center to match Duke’s movement. But as if the team was playing with only four defenders, Cam Reddish casually drifted out behind on the arc at the top of the zone.  Without a defender in sight, Reddish drills the three-pointer, capping his best performance on a college basketball stage, reminding the world for only a minute that Zion Williamson wasn’t the top recruit in the country and finally introducing himself to the world. 

January 12, 2019 was the shining moment for Reddish. It was meant to be his start at re-writing the narrative of his time in college. His incredible performance, helping lead the offense to a come-from-behind road game victory should have been in the headlines. It wasn't. The next game, they lost to Syracuse. Zion scored 35, Reddish didn’t play and it was back to square one.

When Cam Reddish announced his decision in a Players Tribune video, he gave off a signature line: I’m not a prospect, I’m a work in progress. There’s always more to learn.” The man looking to branch away from his quiet nature, quiet town life looked to do it on the biggest stage, Duke University, leading the charge with fellow top prospect RJ Barrett. College is meant to a branching out point for most—the moment of your life where you can truly be your own individual. The problem is that it can also bring up some of your worst habits. Zion Williamson committing to Duke was the worst thing to ever happen to Cam. What was meant to be Cam’s moment, wasn’t allowed to be Cam’s moment. Like an older sibling taking your thunder, Cam remained quiet. 

As he declared for the draft, he was the people said shouldn’t. Despite no one caring for the individual during his time, despite no one realizing how misused the athlete was, he was told to stay. The business decision paid off as he went 10th overall to the rising Atlanta Hawks and prepared the make the case for who he truly was an athlete. 

Since his entrance into the association, we’ve only been left with questions. Is he a NBA caliber player? Was he just flat out bad? Can he do anything? Who is this guy taking up minutes on the floor? 

Stuck between a rock and a hard place, its time to ask the simple question: can we save Cam Reddish?

Back in high school, Cam Reddish was recruited for his ability to be a modern basketball player. A flexible style, slim yet tall, incredible court vision was a scout’s wet dream. And we saw glimpses of that individual during college—moments where he had a ball in his hands, he was a completely different player. [It was as if he became a completely different basketball player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuZ2k-SF2E). But off ball, it wasn’t his forte. Being able to get to the basket, showcase his tight quarters skills and ability to finish, that’s what made him so special. His form was just an added bonus.

Reddish has fallen victim to a bug that most gifted shooters face—the natural form. Most of the times, shooters will begin their stroke from the shooter’s pocket and will subconsciously always look to start from the shooter’s pocket. Some players are taught to cheat this by either taking a dribble or attack the ball—rather than sit for their shot—for quicker transition into their shot. It was always a really good tell that a shooter had confidence in his shot—how quick he was to realize what he needed to do, the prior steps they took to be able to get the ball off as quick as possible. 

Cam doesn’t have these tendencies just yet, the ‘shooter IQ’ isn’t there at the moment. It does feel at times that he forces bad form or doesn’t work through the correct steps. Think about a cutting a vegetable. You could have incredible knife cuts but if the vegetable looks like shit, the pieces might still look like shit. 

But what if Cam is trying to be something that he is not? What if the stats could prove he’s effective as what was expected of him as a prospect in high school, that he truly isn’t mean to be a spot-up shooter despite all of this effort to make him one.

Stats are also a really good tell—the numbers don’t lie. Ignoring his comparison to other players in the association, here are some interesting tidbits in the profile of Cam Reddish:


**Dribbles (Frequency of shooting off of X Dribbles) - FG%**

* 0 (37.9%) - 24.1

* 1 (11.8%) - 55.6

* 2 (18.3%) - 25.0

* 3-6 (23.5%) - 22.2

* 7+ (8.5%) - 38.5%


**Touch Time (Frequency of shooting with this factor) - FG%**

* &lt; 2 Seconds (47.7%) - 27.4

* 2 -6 Seconds (41.2%) - 27.0

* Touch 6+ Seconds (11.1%) - 41.2 


**General Range (Frequency of shooting with this factor) - FG%**

* Catch and Shoot (33.3%) - 17.6

* Pull ups (29.4%) - 26.7

* Less than 10 ft (37.3%) - 40.4

There’s a lot to look at but the numbers continue to describe the narrative: he’s meant meant to control his own shot. He has statistically performed better in possessions where he has been able to have the time to process what is going on. [We always joked about the double spin move but never comment on how he managed to get through three defenders for a good look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHUOtxQNrM0). Or how we won’t see the [highlight play of Cam Reddish dunking on Tyler Hero but we’ll get the highlight of a missed three pointer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO335mJ6alA).

 
You know how we hate it when a power big man takes a three pointer instead of backing down a weaker defender down low? Why won’t we hate it when a natural isolation scorer doesn’t take advantage of a weaker defender and get to the basket?

Reddish can be brilliant off of the dribble. His ability to see the court, his ability to create offense not only for himself but for his teammates. People will be quick to jump on his turnover to assist ratio or the amount of turnovers he commits but often times, most aren’t his fault. Whether it is the cheeky pass, the occasional tight quarters leading to the ball getting poked out or chemistry issues that come with joining a new line-up, he hasn’t been the ball handling liability he’s been made out to be. He also hasn’t been allowed to get into a rhythm—often times Atlanta will need to get several guards 20+ minutes a night.

Truly, Cam Reddish sought a fresh start in the big leagues but instead, it feels like he’s back at Duke. He’s not been used correctly—and while credit to Atlanta for being inventive with his usage, they still haven’t figured out the correct line-up as a whole. The team isn’t performing well as a whole and it is easy to push blame onto the developing Cam Reddish and avoid calling out the team being a complete cluster—filled with talent but no true definition. 

To save Cam Reddish, you need to save the team. The lack of chemistry, being creative to simply be creative, the pressure to succeed and the loss of John Collins have put the franchise in a tailspin, searching for excuses. What is to excuse Trae Young still has another he needs to reach, Bruno Fernando continues to be pushed down in favor for his Maryland brethren Alex Len despite showing a lot of promise as a NBA center. Atlanta’s depth in the guard position has made this reality a little more difficult to implement. So a player that is playing out of his natural position, not getting reps in a role that he could succeed in won’t help the young man’s confidence. It also doesn’t help that he is battling with lottery pick colleague De’Andre Hunter for minutes in the same position—who also has struggled but doesn’t get talked about enough.  

As he said out of high school, he’s a work in progress that hasn’t been allowed to develop. He’s a factory new car that is being stress tested to the point where he’s expected to break. Flexibility shouldn’t be abused but should be treated with care. Just because you have clay that is able to be molded doesn’t mean you just leave it alone, you try to provide definition. Time will heal the damage to Reddish’s game but may not heal the stigma associated with him. Despite the ability to be something special, it feels as if all factors are working against his favor and his quiet personality gets the best of him. Someday, we may just hope that he gets to the environment where he is allowed to speak and hate our lives when he goes on a podcast with his agent.

What this this really means is that the NBA is trying to maximize the value of its games by re-organizing them into more meaningful formats.  This.  Is.  Silly.  There is one thing the NBA needs to do, and it has been apparent for a while now:  Cut out the 7 and 8 seeds because they have never won a title and they never will.

Of course, this would mean an awkward 12-team (no conference seeding for this one) playoff with likely too much time off for the teams with byes to benefit from.  Do we really want to see all the favorites start the second round rusty and possibly lose a series because of it?  Of course not.  But we do want to see the best teams play the most meaningful games possible, right?  Enter the 12-team marathon playoff experience.

In the first round, the bottom eight seeds play each other in a normal best-of-seven format.  Instead of the top four seeds resting idly by and getting out of rhythm though, we get to see them play in a three game round-robin to determine the order in which these top four seeds get to choose their second-round opponent.  These three games will be extremely interesting as they feature the best teams, and you could space the games out with two days inbetween so they'll be fresh.  To keep the regular season important for these top four teams, the team with the higher record in the round robin format would always get home court advantage.  Head-to-head would be the first tiebreaker, regular season head-to-head the second, and overall regular season record the third.

But I have not explained the marathon part yet, have I?  Since this current setup would actually yield fewer total playoff games than the current setup, the league would have to make up for it by giving everybody what they want:  More competitive basketball with the best teams.  The second and third rounds would be best-of-9 series, and the championship would be a best-of-11 series.  

This format also has a hidden bonus in that it would actually promote parity by tiring the best teams out in the later rounds of the playoffs.  Yet, we still get to see all the best teams in a given year gut it out in an even lengthier postseason setting.  This is what the fans want.  This is what the owner's wallets want.

&gt;We investigate the hot hand hypothesis using detailed data on free throws and field goal attempts for the entire 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 NBA regular seasons. Free throws represent a more controlled setting, allowing a closer examination of the potential physiological mechanisms behind success in repeated motions, while field goal attempts represent the setting most observers have in mind when commenting on a player's repeated shooting success. We examine these two settings together, within the same players in the same games, permitting a more comprehensive analysis of the hot hand. We find a small hot hand effect for free throws, concentrated in second and third shots in a free throw sequence, in players shooting at least 100 free throws in a season, and in games where players shoot four to five free throws. We find the opposite results for field goal attempts. If a player makes a field goal, he is less likely to make his next field goal attempt.

It never worked out, that was kind of the point to every single storyline. Something would happen, the plan would fail and the day would be saved. But, hypothetically, if the plan worked, it would be devastating. 

That's kind of what it felt with the Scott Brooks offense--a confusing system, a high fail rate, difficult to execute finally worked. Now, we're left asking the simple question: how?

On paper, the Scott Brooks half-court offense is relatively simple. It starts around the perimeter. You'll also see one side being slightly bunched together, the other side a little more spread.  The unorthodox and somewhat clustered look allows for options. While they initially start centered around the top of the zone, slowly players will migrate across the floor--often times being facilitated through a high screen. It also meshes well with the early transition offense Brooks implements. 

In the past, the Wizards would simply spread out right away, leaving the offense to be reliant on penetration from John Wall, Bradley Beal or Tomas Satoransky . But over time or in the natural flow of the game, a migration emerges. Instead of the previous static stance, there is more fluidity with the offense. 

Its also easier to transition from defense. Again, the players naturally flow to a spot on the court. A player isn't stuck in a single spot anymore, there’s a lot of flexibility as to where someone can be on the court at a given time, they simply just have to just follow an open lane.

[Here's an hour long explanation from Brooks as to what the style is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2C7hZBh-Ts&amp;t=2s). I'll be honest, I don't want to bore you with it and half of the times, Brooks will skip completing his point and its something that I sympathize with. 

Washington likes to move fast. They rank towards the quickest in the NBA at average Time of Possession (20 s), Average Time per Touch (2.75 s)  and Average Dribble Per Touch (2.07). The crazy thing: this isn't meaning they're finishing at the rim with their fast style of play. Which leads us back to the reason why they focus around the top of the half-court zone: they like the jump shot. 

The Washington Wizards average 17.5 attempts from mid-rage, 28.3 attempts from the top of the break and the 7th fewest amount of attempts in the paint (12.1 per game) , despite averaging the most field gold attempts per game (94.7). Its not that Washington isn’t able to get looks in deep in the zone, they just create a lot of shots outside. Over time, as teams inevitably cheat, it then creates more opportunities for Washington to punish.

Let’s just take a look at a couple of plays Washington likes to run. 

First, there is the simple screen and cut. [A simple high screen allows for Beal to turn on the jets, race towards the basket for a simple alley oop.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftQU02Rzhzs) It isn’t fancy, it isn’t specia,l its simply a well executed play created by this focused at the top of the zone.

[Another simple screen opens up Bertans for the lightly contested three pointer against the Suns](https://youtu.be/U-_E9TRB7JM?t=53). But what may be unnoticed is the important the early high screen to get the ball into the hands of Wagner. The play is meant to force Phoenix to react to a cutting Beal however its a ruse, the ball is going to a rounding Bertans for the three or the extra past into the corner for the wide open Jordan McRae.

If you cheat the drive, Rui Hachimura reminds you that the team will pull-up. [Movement at the top of the zone leads to Hachimura rolling into a position with space and drops a mid-range jumper on the former Spur Kawhi Leonard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeuNsK5Xd8U). 

*I also just wanted to showcase this highlight against the Lakers, a game where the Wizards really pulled off some incredible transition offense but the buckets didn't follow. In transition, Beal and Rui are able to get down the court. The Lakers do a pretty good job at preparing for the odd-man situation, Danny Green steps up to stop ball. The natural progression leads to a staggered split over loaded on one side while Wagner and Bertans read the lanes on the opposite side of the floor. Depending on how the Lakers collapse, the amount of options created shouldn't go unnoticed. First, you have the easy lay-up from Rui. Wagner cutting allows for a second option in-case the Lakers overcommit onto Rui. Bertans and IT sit around the perimeter for moral support and the possible three-point shot. Its just well executed with an ingenious design.*

And, of course, there is the ability to execute a high-screen pick and roll. [Mo Wagner was able to abuse this in his career high performance against the Timberwolves.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt7RFXr7I64).


It goes without saying that Bradley Beal has been the most important player for this latest version of the Wizards. But what has been a little bit crazy to realize is how he’s become a much better player as a ball dominant guard. In the past, he’s been a catch-and-shoot player. However, he’s now been recording better splits on unassisted attempts versus assisted attempts. He’s improved his assist-to-turnover ratio and his team-assist ratio for the 5th time in five years. And maybe my favorite statistic, he’s starting to go to the stripe more—around 7 times a game, and is hitting 83% of his free-throws—his best year ever.

Back to praising the organization, the Wiz have had a similar offensive system for sometime but not necessarily the talent. That has all changed. The key additions in the off-season changed the landscape of what the team is able to accomplish. Flexibility in their bigs has been something foreign to the district. Mo Wagner, Davis Bertans and Thomas Bryant and Rui Hachimura having the talent to spread out the floor has finally creating the natural spacing required for the system to work. In the past, the Wizards have attempted to strictly keep the role of the 5 as pick-and-roll master while the 4 acts as another wing presence.  Now, they can be seen all over the court.

Veterans Jordan McRae, Isaiah Thomas, C.J. Miles and Ish Smith have been able to provide meaningful minutes and not be complete liabilities. Overtime, we could see the younger talent pick-up more and more minutes but it does appear the likes of Admiral Schofield, Justin Robinson, Troy Brown Jr still have a lot of aspects of their games to develop. 


While the team is able to score *a lot* of points, the *system* is susceptible of creating additional opportunities for the opponents. Longer rebounds off of missed jump shots leads to an easy transition bucket for their opponents. Surprisingly, their half-court defense isn't terrible-despite giving up a lot of points. Thomas Bryant hasn't developed a strong rim-protector game--which still has left a gap in the Wizards defense--but its progression. Really, the key flaw in the half-court is great ball movement from their opponents or incredible iso play from a star that you just have to setback and appreciate.

There is still a lot of work to be done however some credit should be given: there's a foundation. In what could have been a critical year for the status of Scott Brooks as a NBA head coach, it has instead turned into a building point for the future. Its also a much more appealing take on the stylistic move we've seen in recent years when it comes to the NBA offense. While still not having the talent the contend with the greats, its a start.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,72224,public,self,[OC] When a Mad Scientist's Experiment Finally Works: Why the Wizards of Washington Are Able to Score A Lot of Points,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/e5be1l/oc_when_a_mad_scientists_experiment_finally_works/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's all bad news.

TNT ratings are down 23%, ESPN ratings are down 20%, Regional Sports Network ratings are down 13%.

Ourand did note that Orlando Magic and Atlanta Hawks have increased ratings this season in their local markets so that is good news. However, Washington Wizards ratings are taking in their market

What are the reasons for this? There are many theories. I will post a few that I've heard

1) Cord Cutting. The theory is that cable/Television is dying. If this is true then the NBA can do nothing about this and will continue to suffer declining ratings. 

2) No superteams/decline of the warriors. This theory is that without a superteam for people to root against, people don't want to watch the NBA. Also, the warriors have been the villain the past few seasons and right now they are garbage. 

3) Injuries/load management - Steph Curry, Zion Williamson, Kyrie Irving are the 3 biggest names who have missed games due to injury. All 3 are probably in the top ten most well known NBA players. Also, Kawhi Leonard has sat out games due to ""load management

4) Too much offense/Too many 3 pointers - this theory is that people are tired of watching All Star Game level defense and are tired of watching endless 3 pointers and decline of the big man

5)Regular Season is too long/irrelevant - this theory is that fans don't care about the regular season, especially when compared to the NFL regular season

6) China backlash - this theory is that NBA fans are boycotting the league because of the China fiasco from a few months back

Arenas wasn't Harden level, but a similar mould in many ways. He was high usage and probably could've been even higher. Very good shooter and could get to the rim. Had a knack for hitting big shots down the stretch too.

Jamison was one of the first real stretch 4s leading into the current era, and in hindsight, maybe could've played centre.

They had 2 competent centres in Thomas and Haywood. Good defensively, got rebounds. Solid players.

Butler wasn't an elite shooter, but offered good wing scoring. Easily could've been a 3rd best player on a championship level team, from memory.

Stevenson was a 3 and D SG/SF. Lock players down, hit shots. He was also a character who could get under people's skin.

Add in meh role players like Songaila and Mason, and they look like they had good scoring at 4 positions and should've had a somewhat competent defense.

**Goal**: Use ePPG to adequately compare players of any era based on their Points, time spent on the court, and usage rate.

**Equation/Method**: PPG ÷ USG% ÷ MP × 36

This statistic basically removes Usage% and makes it so that the player would theoretically take every shot when on the court with the same efficiency. This in turn rewards players who score on a high **and** efficient level.

Of course, the second imbalance in counting metrics is the discrepancy in Minutes Played, since players that play more tend to score more. For this, I've adjusted the stats to the standard Per/36.

This creates the ePPG/36 statistic, and the beauty of it is that you can then divide the final number by whatever number you'd like to base the USG% for real life capacity (Divide by 4 for a 25% USG, 3 for a 33%, etc.)

Using this metric, you can easily see that top players are not just scoring at an average rate while playing more minutes, they are scoring more efficiently than the players below him on the list.

**Results:**

**Section 1: Top-20 2018-19 Scorers**

The first thing I did was adjust the seasons of the Top-20 scorers of 2018-19, including James Harden's incredible 36.1 PPG, which proves to still be incredible after factoring his astronomic usage. [Here](https://imgur.com/ifY70o9) is an image of the spreadsheet, showing the calculations. For a more comprehensive arrangement, here is an [interactive chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSoKyYuDPdZVFQfZulQtaOAss7Yn9WkCS0KkjFSuUr8aOxeuLja2_eWZ7UATHnxw9owhkyEfTB2dWti/pubchart?oid=1490100582&amp;format=interactive) that allows you to directly compare players to one another.

* As you can see, most players last year hover at around 85-90 ePPG, with some outliers in either direction.

I'd like to point out Anthony Davis, who even after being put on a 15-20 minutes restriction in late February was still able to perform at a high and efficient rate, scoring an outstanding 95.78, the highest ePPG of any player last year.

**Section 2: Top PPG Seasons Adjusted**

The second section of seasons I adjusted were the 12 highest PPG seasons of the Shot Clock Era in order to see how well these volume scorers stood against the metric. Once again, [here](https://imgur.com/k0EyAzr) is the list and [chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSoKyYuDPdZVFQfZulQtaOAss7Yn9WkCS0KkjFSuUr8aOxeuLja2_eWZ7UATHnxw9owhkyEfTB2dWti/pubchart?oid=1339092579&amp;format=interactive).

Michael Jordan absolutely floods the list, and his numerous seasons in the high 80's show just how dominant he was regardless of what metric you use.

Another point of emphasis should be put on Allen Iverson, who due to his wishes to play as many minutes as possible will struggle in this statistic.

**Section 3: Top ePPG Seasons of All-Time**

Finally, these are the most efficient players of the Shot Clock era. Most of these players excelled in scoring while playing a low amount of minutes at a minuscule Usage Rate.

* [Spreadsheet](https://imgur.com/izav6pA)

* [Chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSoKyYuDPdZVFQfZulQtaOAss7Yn9WkCS0KkjFSuUr8aOxeuLja2_eWZ7UATHnxw9owhkyEfTB2dWti/pubchart?oid=1076144386&amp;format=interactive)

Two main points:

Adrian Dantley absolutely destroys this catagory, appearing 3 times. His continued excellence in efficiency can be attributed to his low usage rate, which outweighs his average scoring and minutes played.

Kiki Vanderweghe's 1983-84 Season was the most efficient season of all time. While on a Denver team with Alex English (Also on this list) and time-traveling Wide Receiver Mike Evans he recorded 29.4 Points on 27.8% Usage Rate as the team's 2nd option, while playing only 35.1 minutes.

**Conclusion:** I have reason to believe that ePPG is a favorable way to compare volume scorers without bias while rewarding players who can score at a high amount when given less to work with.

I'm pretty confident that the current top 8 teams in the East will end up in the playoffs, and most would probably agree. The only spots with any doubt belong to the Magic and Nets, but they are both more talented than the remaining Eastern teams and Vucevic's return in particular will boost the Magic.

In the West, there are basically six locks: Lakers, Clippers, Rockets, Nuggets, Jazz and the Mavericks. Otherwise the final two spots are pretty much up in the air, with everybody but the Spurs, Warriors and Grizzlies fairly competitive in my opinion. My two picks are:

**Timberwolves:** I am most confident about this team since they have one of the two best players of this group in Towns (the other being Lillard of course), have a slight head-start over the other teams and have two of the best lockdown wing defenders in Covington and Okogie. Wiggins also looks like he has genuinely turned a corner offensively. However, their depth is pretty poor and a major injury to any of these four players would spoil their chances in my opinion.

**Pelicans:** This may look very silly since they are far behind in the race but I think the coinciding returns of Favors and Zion will do wonders to their team if they can stay healthy from here. In particular, the return of Favors will be super helpful to the team since he is their second best player imo. The difference between him and Hayes/Okafor will provide a massive defensive boost to a team struggling on that end of the ball. Likewise, I think Zion will be less of a target for opposing players compared to if he started on opening night. With their returns, the Pelicans will be able to play more diverse lineups and experiment with combinations of shooting and defense, and this could become a nasty team to play.

I think Portland's injury issues are too big to overcome and I don't expect Carmelo to keep performing, otherwise the Suns seem to be regressing, and I don't expect Ayrton's return to improve much since Baynes has played lights out. I also don't believe the Kings are talented enough to snag a playoff spot and the Thunder is too messy a team to bank on and may trade their assets later in the season.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,72146,public,self,The Playoff Race,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/e4te06/the_playoff_race/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Obviously he's been shooting horribly inefficiently. Numbers like 26.9% from 3 and 28.1% from the field and only scoring 9.4ppg

So, on the surface, he looks like a terrible pickup by the Warriors

But something these stats imply to me is that he's been given the greenlight to shoot and he's being guarded like a scoring threat by opposing teams. Maybe someone who's watched Warriors games could give me more insight on that.

He clearly doesn't have a broken shot, as he's shooting 87% on his freethrows, and he sometimes explodes like he did for 5/6 3s on 50% shooting from the field, against a notoriously good defensive team interestingly enough.

A full starting 5 signed until 2021 with the oldest player at 27. Additionally, the bench is signed to a series of excellent value-to-contribution contracts.

Is there a better roster in the NBA that combines current effectiveness with upside, all while retaining a good value down the line?

Through means of the G league, and even the Big 3 we have seen quality prospects flourish into decent players.

But his teammate, LaMarcus Aldridge has the most mid-range attempts thus far. And even though he isn't as hot as Derozan, he is still pretty efficient and very dangerous.

As you can see on the [shot chart](https://i.imgur.com/UlVfaqT.png), his favourite area of operating is opposite of Derozan, that was also mentioned in the Derozan thread by some other user. 

To me is really interesting that two of the probably best mid range players ended up on Spurs's offense, and are flowing together really nicely. I know there were a lot of rumblings about trading Derozan, but I highly doubt that, given his play style and his personality, he fits perfectly in San Antonio.

Some thoughts:

* LaMelo really has most of the playmaking instincts of Lonzo. Made some great passes and reads but some his teammates weren't ready/didn't see the same thing

* He attacks more than Lonzo but isn't really a good finisher through contact. Runs in the family I guess

* He needs to be given the keys to the offense to be effective. They tried running offball plays for him but he preferred to pull back and create himself...

* Speaking of which, yeah he's gonna have trouble breaking his opponent down in the pros. He has dribbles like Zo, not enough to gain separation

* His go to is his stepback 3 but I saw him grab his right knee alot, maybe he has an injury? Most of his threes were short

* defense is still bad. 

Hampton on the other hand:

* quick as fuck. He was the quickest dude on the floor. He just needs to do it consistently.

* shot is suspect. There were times when opponents would go under screens and he never took a shot.

* needs to play with confidence. He looks like he played with extra motivation tonight, given the matchup. It played in his favor.

I think Melo goes top 3, Hampton is a lotto to mid-first.

Amidst the Luka Magic, James Harden gunning for a 40 pt/avg, LeBron James defying father time, Giannis making a case for back to back MVPs etc, Sabonis is quietly putting together a historic season. 

Only 45 players have accomplished this feat and he would be the 2nd youngest if he were to sustain these averages. The youngest was none other then Kareem Abdul Jabbar who did it at 22 and currently the second youngest is Round Mound of Rebounds, our very own TNT analyst, Charles Barkley who did it at age 23 but has a later birthday then Sabonis (February 20th.) 

The infamous trade seems like one of those trades where it worked out for both teams looking back in hindsight. Indiana got back two marquee players (gws Oladipo) and now with the team consisting also of Myles Turner &amp; Malcolm Brogdon, Indy isn't an easy 1st round shoo. OKC managed to flip PG for SGA, a trade chip in paul and treasure chest of draft picks. 

With all that being said, Sabonis was more of a throw-in at that point, it's amazing how much he's grown. I definitely think even if Oladipo comes back his numbers sustainable. Definitely an all-star this season, people need to notice what an amazing season he's having. Jrue Holiday was probably the most underrated player in 2018-2019.

Also, what I mean by this is, if when taking all offense, defense, and advanced stats is it possible to work out a rating to then list players eligible on games played and/or mpg to see who is the absolute best that season.

The company he was leaving had just finished the year behind of his new company and although this businessman had spent his whole career at one company, he felt he was better suited to leave his friends and have a fresh start. If you're a basketball fan, you know I'm talking about Kevin Durant, a player who left the Thunder to join the Warriors and as a result, was able to start his own production house with a show on ESPN+, win two championships and build his brand through the endorsements living in such a demanding market offers. My point was to show sports is a business and players have to do what's best for them, regardless of loyalty.

I still believe that, but after my own perspectives changing, I realized I had the wrong point of view. In high school sports, players represent their neighborhood or their town. In college sports, players represent their state, but to lesser of an extent due to recruiting. And in pro sports, players represent...what? Their city? Sometimes, in the cases of Lebron James, Lonzo Ball and Derrick Rose (none of whom play for their hometown anymore). But usually they represent the organization. They represent a general manager from Massachusetts and a coach from Indiana drafting a player from California to a pro club based in Texas. That's not bad. It just is.

But after my last article, I tried an experiment on NBA 2K19. I added all six of the teams to MyLeague and started the expansion draft with one simple rule: only free agents were allowed in the draft pool. I'll explain. Most of the time, when a league expands, every other team can choose to protect certain players and the rest will be put in a pool for the expansion team to pick from. We saw this most recently with the NHL's Vegas Golden Knights. They made a motley crew of misfits who embraced their identity and became a powerhouse. But by leaving only free agents unprotected, a few interesting things happened: firstly, some of the game's biggest superstars were now left open to play as part of an expansion team, giving these new clubs an immediate face to the franchise and an established star. Secondly, it gave these stars a free choice. No longer can they be vilified as a snake or sell-out, they never had the choice to begin with. With this in mind, I ran the draft and some of the NBA's biggest stars found themselves in new homes: Lebron James in Las Vegas, Paul George in Louisville, Deandre Jordan in Vancouver, Kevin Durant in Seattle, Nikola Jokic and Brandon Ingram in Montreal, Dwight Howard and Carmelo Anthony in Virginia Beach. But of all those players, only one signed their new contract with a new team. Lebron left Las Vegas to play for the Lakers, which ironically leads to my next point.

I got in an argument a while ago with this guy who thought the Lakers were bad for the NBA since they have all the best talent. After doing some research, I found that most of the Lakers' biggest moves to get the stars they had were trades or draft picks. Wilt Chamberlain? Trade. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar? Trade. Magic Johnson? Draft. Kobe Bryant? A two-for-one here with a draft day trade. Pau Gasol and Lamar Odom? Trades. Anthony Davis? Trades. When you look back at the major moves that have made the Lakers champions, the only two that brought stars to Los Angeles via free agency were Shaquille O'Neal and Lebron James. And if we're being technical, Lebron hasn't won a title yet, although this might be his year.

Thinking about the Lakers' trade success and the (simulated) retention of NBA 2K19's expansion teams didn't make me realize that smaller markets have a fighting chance thru the max contract or by draft acumen, I've been using the success of the Utah Jazz, San Antonio Spurs, Portland Trail Blazers, Indiana Pacers and Orlando Magic as arguments against the idea that big-market teams have an unfair advantage for a long time. But it did make me realize that small market teams can weaponize that advantage for themselves by trading away their superstars for pieces, essentially creating a sum vs. whole argument.

When Wilt was traded to the Lakers, he was the MVP traded for Darrall Imhoff, Jerry Chambers and Archie Clark. When Kareem was traded to the Lakers, it was for Elmore Smith, Brian Winters, and rookies Dave Meyers and Junior Bridgeman. Kobe's draft rights were traded for Vlade Divac. Pau Gasol was traded for Javaris Crittendon, Aaron McKie, Marc Gasol's draft rights, and draft picks that later turned into OJ Mayo and Xavier Henry (quick aside: the Grizzlies could've had a team of Mike Conley, Marc Gasol, Kevin Love and Lance Stephenson or Landry Fields in 2010, but hindsight is 20/20). Lamar Odom was traded for Shaquille O'Neal, Caron Butler and Brian Grant. I listed all those deals to say it took almost fifty years for a team trading their star to win a championship. The Lakers sold penny stocks at dollar prices for a half-century and only the Heat won a title, although Memphis got close.

I think that might be changing, however. Big-market teams have gotten greedier for stars and are willing to pay more in players and in prospects to do it. We saw a proto-version of in Houston, when Sixth Man Of The Year James Harden was traded to Houston for prospects. I call this a ""proto"" because Oklahoma City wanted to keep Harden, but couldn't come to terms on a deal and Harden hadn't developed into the star he is yet. But this offseason, we saw two trades that could change the NBA. Oklahoma City traded star forward Paul George for point guard prospect Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and FIVE first-round draft picks, as well as sneaky star Danilo Gallinari. New Orleans traded star forward Anthony Davis for Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart and three first-round picks. With New Orleans having G League Executive of the Year Trajan Langdon and Oklahoma City having wizard Sam Presti at their respective helms, I think we're on the cusp of a new era of basketball business. In return for one player, New Orleans now has one of the most exciting line-ups in the NBA, especially when chosen one Zion Williamson returns. And Oklahoma City has so many options, it's difficult to count. We could be looking at the next Warriors-style youth movement in OKC.

I think this is the wave of the future. There's rumors reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo may be leaving Milwaukee in 2021. Why not trade him to New York for say, Dennis Smith Jr., Mitchell Robinson, Kevin Knox and four first-rounders if you can? This may not be as far-fetched as it sounds, especially with the history of the NBA. Small-market teams have thrived on their scouting and coaching, and trading these stars for instant, immediate rebuilds seems like a strategy that may work. If New Orleans can make it into the playoffs once they get healthy, we could be looking at a scary team rather than a scary player, with the average age of the team being just over 25 years old by the time the playoffs start in April. We've already seen a line-up similar to this once with the Oklahoma City Thunder back in 2010 with the ascendant Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant and James Harden on similar rookie deals. The Thunder had James Harden for only three years before a trade, but with the Lebron James experiment failing the way it did, maybe New Orleans can pitch their future stars on hometown loyalty and a sense of stability to save a bit of money on their contracts. The contracts should expire either the year before or the year of the expiry of the NBA collective bargaining agreement, which may see a rise in the salary cap.

The argument to balance big market cities makes less sense every year, especially with the NBA's parity having a chance to showcase itself the way it does. Over half the league makes the playoffs after an 82-game season, with the playoffs themselves being a seven-game series over four rounds. The best teams usually make the Finals and since NBA expansion, those teams are coming from increasingly smaller markets. Since the NBA-ABA merger in 1976, only fifteen franchises have won a championship. Those teams are the Portland Trail Blazers once, the Washington Bullets (now Wizards) once, the Seattle SuperSonics once, the Los Angeles Lakers eleven times, the Boston Celtics four times, the Philadelphia 76ers once, the Detroit Pistons three times, the Chicago Bulls six times, the Houston Rockets twice, the San Antonio Spurs four times, the Dallas Mavericks once, the Miami Heat twice, the Golden State Warriors four times, the Cleveland Cavaliers once and the Toronto Raptors once.

Of those fifteen teams, their market sizes as of Nielsen's 2018-19 rankings are #22 (Portland), #6 (Washington DC), #13 (Seattle), #2 (Los Angeles), #9 (Boston), #4 (Philadelphia), #14 (Detroit), #3 (Chicago), #7 (Houston), #31 (San Antonio), #5 (Dallas), #16 (Miami), #8 (Bay Area), #19 (Cleveland) and #1 (Toronto). Going back ten years to the 2009-2010 season, only Los Angeles has been in the top ten of American market size. Quick asterisk: Toronto is throwing this off a bit, because of their status as the biggest market in Canada as well as the only market outside of the United States. But whether or not you take them into account, the average market size ranking of the NBA champions hovers from 10 to 11. The tenth and eleventh largest markets in the United States are Atlanta and Tampa, but we need to expand those parameters since Tampa doesn't have an NBA team. If we include the ninth and twelfth largest markets in America, we have Boston, Atlanta and Phoenix. Boston and Phoenix are sitting with winning records as of this writing and what Atlanta is (severely) lacking in wins, they're making up for in Trae Young.

All this to say, the edge has been increasingly given to smaller markets and the three smallest markets in the NBA: Memphis, Oklahoma City and New Orleans have the tools to make big moves in the NBA landscape. If youth movements in smaller cities are the wave of the future, the future is now.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,71938,public,self,Small Markets and their Assault on the NBA Record Books,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/e3qh1b/small_markets_and_their_assault_on_the_nba_record/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Basketball On Paper, Dean Oliver established the four factors that lead to winning in the NBA: Shooting, Turnovers, Rebounding, and Free Throws. 

According to Oliver, shooting is the most important factor, followed by turnovers, rebounding, and free throws. Each factor has a corresponding defensive factor as a well (opponent shooting, opponent turnovers, opponent rebounding, etc...)

I took a look at the different factors for each team and plotted them as a [scatter chart](https://imgur.com/a/FYa05CC) with the offensive factor on the x-axis and the corresponding defensive factor on the y-axis. 

* The shooting factor is measured using Effective Field Goal Percentage (eFG%)

* The turnover factor is measured using Turnover Percentage (TOV%).

* The rebounding factor is measured using Offensive and Defensive Rebound Percentage (ORB% and DRB%, respectively)

* The free throw factor is a measure of both how often a team gets to the line and how often they make them. 

I think there are some pretty interesting trends that pop out to me: 

* The Wizards are shooting the hell out of the ball, but they're also allowing their opponents to score just as easily. 

* Miami is both forcing a ton of turnovers, but also simultaneously turning the ball over themselves too much. 

* The Sixers have the lowest opponent offensive rebound % and I suspect their size has a lot do with it 

* James Harden is single handedly leading the Rockets to the highest FTA rate in the league.

For example the ibaka trade was a much needed trade but was not a big name at all ( I know not the best example since ibaka is really good) 

A trade I would like to see if ROCO going to either the raptors or mavericks. The benefits for the raptors is that the always weak sf is filled and more defence is added. Idk what the trade would be but let’s say the main players stay the same at full strength the line up will be pg- Lowry sg-Vanleet sf-ROCO pf- siakam c-gasol or ibaka. The trade will most likely include og anunoby and either gasol or ibaka as well. This would make the raptors a bigger threat than they already are. 

For him going to the mavs you might say they have a sf in luka but luka can play sg and pg if he wanted to. Basketball is a positionless game and having both on the court with kp will be deadly. All three can shoot, kp for paint defence and ROCO or perimeter defence.

That said, I think it's Giannis Antetokounmpo, with Anthony Davis and Marcus Smart trailing as *extremely* close 2nd-place guys. 

Antetokounmpo has helped the Bucks obtain the 3rd ranked defense in the entire league and has propelled them to holding opponents to 42% shooting. Good enough for 2nd in the league.

Antetokounmpo is 1st in both defensive rating and defensive win shares, 2nd in defensive box plus minus, and is top 20 in steals and blocks. These stats in themselves aren't good arguments, but they're still rather impressive.

Last season, he was used primarily in help situations but now he's getting used more on the ball and that's where his versatility is being highlighted. He has total freedom to what he wants. 

His foot speed and lateral quickness have improved, his close-out game hasn't been as sloppy or uncoordinated, and he's gotten stronger as well. He's still a bit raw on the perimeter but I think it'll smooth itself out over the season. 

I give him the edge over Davis due to the fact that he's much bigger and stronger yet has better lateral quickness and can stay in front of shiftier players much better than Davis can. 

I give him the edge over Smart due to his height, length, and strength allowing to give much larger players a tougher time than Smart could. He's a guard and he can guard 1-5, but that's good in doses and is limited at times. 

All in all, his main arguing points are his defensive versatility and help defense. I think he's the best help defender in the league and also has a solid case for being the most versatile as well. 

That said, if anyone else where to go in-depth I would totally listen to the idea of someone else being a better defender than Antetokounmpo.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,71837,public,self,Who is the best defender in the league as of now,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/e374xr/who_is_the_best_defender_in_the_league_as_of_now/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is something I just cannot fully understand as someone who grew up with a completely different culture with regards to the coach/player relationship. Perhaps you can help me comprehend it better.

I am not talking about LeBron who quite obviously has the credentials to call  and change plays because he arguably understands the game better than many of coaches in the NBA. But a player like Ben Simmons seems to able to ignore his coach just the same without delivering LeBron's results.

If I read his Brett Brown's sour face right, Simmons is regularly not following the instructions given during time-outs. His usage rate in 4th quarter situations is abysmal and despite the fact that his team is in dire need of his jump shooting, he is not even attempting to shoot the ball at all (one three doesn't suffice) which severely harms the Philadelphia 76er's tactical options and therefore also title chances. 

In Europe, the coach would simply tell the player to shoot the ball and make plays in the 4th quarter or you ride the bench. Or the NFL with Bill Belichick, can you imagine a star player who is not following his tactical plan for the game, not once but for years? Now I understand basketball is a different game and going through with that is more difficult in a salary cap world, but looking at Philadelphia's situation and lack of improvement I cannot confidently say that their current course will lead to better results. Frankly it seems idiotic to me. You pay this man 170m $ and you can't tell him what to do on the basketball court?

This entire debate about ""when will Ben Simmons decide to take shots"" seems just bizarre to me. Unless you're called Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, if you're a dribbler in European soccer who plays on the wing and your coach tells you to eat grass, to just run up and down the wing each play which improves defence but robs the player of the energy to have his usual offensive impact, then that's what you're expected to do. Doesn't matter if it makes you look worse on Instagram or in offensive stats. There are always unhappy players who would voice their unhappiness with how they're being used or whose execution and effort is lacking, that's normal, but generally it is accepted that you do what you're told.

In the NBA it almost feels like the debate is skewed into a direction akin to ""it's the player's choice whether or not to abide by his coach's tactical plan"".

I know I picked an extreme example, but the entire culture seems very foreign to me. Looking at the Bulls, there's a coach who put his players into the spotlight by voicing his disappointment about bad performances, a coach who benches a disappointing star player. Not outrageous behaviour if you ask me considering how badly his players performed. However as a result he is being put in the hot seat and talking heads on ESPN ask for him to lose his job. Which of course only further enables player behaviour like this in the first place. It doesn't seem like a healthy way to manage teams.

What do you think about this situation? Is that just something you have to accept because star players make such a difference in basketball or could the NBA maybe change culturally to a certain degree?",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,71821,public,self,How come some NBA players seem to be able to just ignore their coaches?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/e33plr/how_come_some_nba_players_seem_to_be_able_to_just/,,,,,,,,,,,,,
