The incident came as the NBA finds itself connected to the ongoing protests in China.


How will the NBA/China resolve itself?

The CCP does not operate in a top down dictatorial manner, unlike states like Saudi Arabia or North Korea, where succession planning is based on heredity. The CCP has never had leadership pass in any sort of hereditary way, in fact, leadership is chosen based on election by CCP members.

I think the NBA, being a sporting organisation should not be pulled into politics, unfortunately, China thinks it's in their interests to take every opportunity to ramp up nationalism and feign insult to the Chinese race, so inoffensive remarks like these become a political basketball.

the conflicting aspect though is that even if the subject is political, that sporting people shouldn't be silenced from giving their opinion if its relevant to the discussion at the time.

as was said ~ basketball and the NBA organisation always represented the values of individual freedom to speak and it would be a win for China and a loss for the rest of the world ~ but more importantly a loss of people's individual right to express their concerns, their joy, their thinking in general ~ if we were made to comply with the dictates of China and keep silent on issues for fear of repercussions on social media or any other outlet that could be used for propaganda purposes.

I know the bottom line at the end for both sides will be only about basketball and how much money is involved with the NBA’s and CBA’s major sponsors and their products. The Hong Kong protests discussions will be minimized and be given less attention just so they can get back to normal once things are settled between the NBA and mainland China. They are making a big issue right now because surprisingly one NBA representative ( Morey) expressed his own negative opinion about the Hong Kong protests which caused the Chinese government to react but their current actions against the NBA will be temporary.

The NBA will eventually salvage its NBA/CBA arrangement with China. China has way too many NBA/CBA fans to ban the NBA or not televise games. I’m confident everything will be back to normal shortly especially when both sides benefit financially with the NBA/CBA arrangement. Remember, both sides love basketball with the NBA &amp; CBA but the real game to everyone is making money.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,67226,public,self,What do you think of the fan who was ejected from a Sixers game for supporting the Hong Kong Protests?

The CCP has never had leadership pass in any sort of hereditary way, in fact, leadership is chosen based on election by CCP members.

In China there a a total of 90 million CCP members, that's about 7% of the country. These are the ruling elites of the country. They actually vote through a multi-step process for the leader of the CCP. You might actually liken it to the electoral process at the beginning of the US, where only white landowning men were allowed to participate, in China only CCP members are allowed to vote.

Within those members of the CCP, there is constant activity and battle to position themselves to rise through the ranks and reach ever more senior positions.

This entire episode can be viewed through the prism of various party members trying to win public support by being more ""woke"". You see, just like American politicians can gain support by bashing China, Chinese politicians can get more support by bashing America. So this slew of organisations ""banning"" the Rockets and NBA is a woke performative dance trying to curry public opinion and favor.

Neither side will back down, since by backing down it would mean losing face, in America's case, it would be like someone admitting that freedom of speech is not important.  From the Chinese side, it would be like someone admitting that territorial soverignty was not important.

I can see 2 scenarios where this could realistically resolve, since Morey fired/resigning or either side giving in is not going to happen.

1) Someone gets killed - Some sort of tragedy would wake everyone up that it's only a game and that everyone is taking it too far and in the aftermath of the tragedy, there would be healing.

2) Yao Ming reaches over to Morey and they reconcile in some public way - Yao Ming has the most credibility since he is the FIRST person to boycott the rockets in the aftermath of this incident, in fact, every single company followed his lead thus making him a de facto leader on this topic.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,67211,public,self,How will the NBA/China resolve itself?,0,1570702975,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/dff2os/how_will_the_nbachina_resolve_itself/,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dear NBA President Adam Silver and Rocket ex-owner Tilman Fertitta,

Recently, Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey expressed about him supporting Hong Kong striving for it’s democracy on Twitter. This led the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) and some Chinese fans assaulting and threatening about ceasing the business cooperation.

I feel deeply sorry and furious about this situation. I strongly condemn the relevant parties bringing politics into sports events and also making unreasonable persecution against Morey’s personal beliefs.

I sincerely wish that the relevant parties can proactively respond to this incident:

1. Commits that no one will be dismissed because of political views.

2. As the world's leading sports league, the NBA will lead by example showing the world about universal value. It should not be influencing the sport itself.

3. NBA will proactively extinguish the incident. While I understand that many Chinese fans society are upset about this incident, the Rockets are also important to them. Therefore, the league must handle this incident properly.

I here wish 2020 NBA season can starts with peace and the NBA is always a leader to show the humanities to the world.

**From a business standpoint**

&gt; China is a huge market for the players and the league. Some of the biggest stars in NBA have huge following in china and sponsorship deals with Chinese companies. Steph, Klay, Harden are some example but not the only ones. 

&gt; It is easy for us (fans) to criticize china and the league/players for not backing Morey as we won't face any consequences. It's not you income or savings that are hurt by you tweeting openly about it and asking the players to back moral over money sounds **honorable and righteous** it is really unfair. Would you be okay with taking a big or small impact to your income? Maybe but I would say the majority would simply look the other way. 

&gt; The league is trying to be more progressive but there are still certain issue they have to tread cautiously. It's not simply going all in or bust.

Dame, CJ, Zach Collins, and Rodney Hood. The rest are either trade acquisitions (Whiteside, Bazemore), FA signings (Hezonja, Gasol, Tolliver), young guys getting more minutes (Simons) or an injured player who didn't play in last year's playoffs (Nurkic). A lot of people don't know what to expect from them, so I'm going to give a quick rundown of each player and then an overall paragraph.

**Dame/CJ**: 
These guys have been in the league for years, you know what to expect. They’ll be pretty much the same but slightly improved. Specifically, CJ has been working on passing and both Dame and CJ work on their defense. They are also going to be playing off-ball more this year

**Kent Bazemore**: Recently acquired for Evan Turner. It is very uncertain if he will start, or if Rodney will. He can complement Dame/CJ’s offense with his defense, but with two defensive bigs, we might want Rodney, who’s better on offense. We (r/ripcity) are split on who will start, but I think it’s 70/30 for Baze. He’s someone who can be a ballhandler and create his own shot to let Dame/CJ play off-ball, like they want to. He is typically a good shooter, although he had a bad 3pt% last year. [These graphics](https://imgur.com/a/DVF3z8m) should show that his shooting should be significantly improved with us. He’s also known to be a good defender and has a 7’0 wingspan. 

**Zach Collins**: Zach will be the starting PF for us. He is slightly better as a 5, but he’s mobile enough to play the PF, and has played PF half the time anyway. He’s a great defender and shot-blocker, but gets into fouls a lot. I feel like a good portion of the fouls are from illegal screens and another portion is clean blocks that are called fouls. He said that some refs have told him that they didn’t think he’d be able to block it, so they called a foul, so if he has earned a better reputation as a defender, the fouls should go down. He’s been working hard on offense all summer, he said that was his main priority. He was already an okay shooter, and showed flashes of good footwork in the post, but I think we’ll see a noticeable offensive improvement this year.

**Hassan Whiteside**: Another person who’s extremely excited to be here. Every interview is just him raving about us. He’s wanted to come here for years, and Neil Olshey has tried to get him too. Dame/CJ have recruited him in the past as well. Anyway, he’s a great shot blocker and rebounder, said his goal is to lead the league in both. Also said that he can pass well now in our system and will get a triple double with assists, but I’m taking that with a grain of salt until I see something real.

**Jusuf Nurkic**: Our 3rd guy, who is extremely underrated. He’s been our defensive anchor, our best rebounder and a good 3rd option on offense. Unfortunately he broke his leg and missed the playoffs but he is recovering well. They are not giving a timeline intentionally, all we know is the initial timeline was mid-February and he’s recovering much quicker than expected. I personally think he’ll be back late December, early January, but they might want to be extra careful and keep him out until late January to start easing him back in. 

**Rodney Hood**: It’s his first full season with us. Last season, he was a huge spark off the bench, but he was just thrown into the offense, now he’s been a part of it for a while, and fully integrated into it. He’s good at creating off the dribble and is an average defender. Like many of the new additions, he’s been incredibly stoked to be here and that should boost how well he plays. If you know Rodney, confidence/comfortability is a big thing for him.

**Anfernee Simons**: There is so much hype around Ant from the team that I could right an entire book filled with quotes about how much the players, coaches and front office is raving about him. Instead, the only quote I’ll mention is from our GM, Neil Olshey, who said on multiple occasions (unprompted) that he’s as talented as anyone he’s ever drafted. He’s obviously drafted Dame and CJ, but he was also the Assistant GM when Blake and DeAndre were drafted (and he assembled Lob City as the GM before coming to Portland prior to Dame’s rookie season). However, despite all this hype, I personally don’t think he’ll play more than 20 mins a game, so he’ll only have limited opportunities to showcase his talents. He’s a good shooter from 3 and mid-range, and he’s extremely explosive/athletic.

**Pau Gasol**: Everyone knows who Pau is, but he’s 39 years old, and will probably not play more than 10-15 minutes/game, especially after Nurk comes back. He’ll provide some depth at center and will mentor Zach and Skal

**Mario Hezonja**: He is a wild card. He hasn’t been particularly good in his short career, but he’s shown some great flashes (cough, LeBron block). He did end off last season well, but it’s a meaningless and small sample. He’s good distributor and really wants to play that point forward role for us. He’s also long time family friends with Nurk, and was neighbours with him, way before either of them were in the League. He also joked that Nurk is probably closer with his dad than he is. Basically another guy who’s just stoked to be here. But in terms of minutes, I think he will be in the rotation to start the year, unless he doesn't play well in training camp.

**Anthony Tolliver**: Another new addition this year. I don’t think he will be part of the rotation full time, but I think he will start off playing with some decent minutes and if Pau or Hezonja aren’t as good as we hope, then he’ll probably get more burn. He’s a good shooter, and an okay defender

**Gary Trent Jr**: He almost definitely won’t be in the rotation, but I expect him to get some decent minutes every once in a while. He’s a good shooter but inconsistent. Also a good playmaker and defender. The coaching staff also said that his defense is improved. Him and Zach Collins both were in Portland practicing for nearly the entire summer. He also has a great attitude (which of course, is expected if you’re part of the Blazers) and is becoming one of my favourite current Blazers. He's also starting to get some buzz from the players, everyone said he's been really good so far (it's only been like 3 days though)

**Skal Labissiere**: I’ll be honest, I don’t know too much about him. All we really saw last year was the last game of the season where he was *really* good and had 27/15, but that’s pretty much it. Didn’t play in summer league because of a minor injury, but the coaching staff also said they were satisfied with his progression and might not have played anyway. He’s a good shooter, especially for a big, but I don’t really know what to make of him yet.


**Nassir Little**: Our rookie, was projected to be a lottery pick but slipped all the way down to us. He will not be in the rotation. He’s very raw but a good defender so there is upside for the future.


#General: 

Overall, we have way more options on offense than ever before. It seems to be more in line with Stotts’ offense and we will be playing at a faster pace with more shooting. Yes we lost some valuable perimeter defense with Moe/Chief leaving but improved our offense and our inside defense. Also, our culture is just so good, all the guys are so happy to be here and have talked about how special this team’s chemistry is. Neil Olshey makes it a priority to only bring good quality *people*, and Dame’s leadership sets the tone for the whole locker room. Neil has also tried to get Whiteside, Bazemore and Hezonja in the past, just a fun fact. But also, I kind of feel bad that other people don’t know how good the culture is and don’t get to see all these interviews and stories. Anyway, to sum up, Dame, Terry Stotts and Neil Olshey have all said that this is the deepest team in their time here (I like to call it the DOT era (Dame, Olshey, Terry)).

#Biggest Questions: 

How will we handle our defense, what happens to Whiteside when Nurk comes back, is there a Kevin Love trade incoming?

**Defense**: I think we’ll notice the loss of Harkless/Aminu at times, but I think we have significantly improved our offense. We also have improved our inside defense, with Whiteside and Zach in the paint, and when Nurk comes back, him as well. All 3 are amazing rim protectors, and the plan will be have a lot of help defense on the perimeter and to funnel them to paint where we have great shot blockers. I believe rim protection is more valuable than perimeter defense, and that team defense more than makes up for the lack of great 1-on-1 defenders.

**Whiteside**: Will he get traded when Nurk comes back? Maybe. Right now, one of our reporters said that a reliable inside source said that there is no plan to trade Whiteside or Bazemore at all during the season, but they could’ve just said that to save face/good PR. Whiteside’s minutes will take a big hit when Nurk is back, and there is potential for unhappy Whiteside, despite our great culture. Also Neil Olshey has said that they may explore some trades mid-season, so maybe he was hinting at something specific, but it could’ve just been general. He also has said there have been multiple instances where they almost were a part of a big trade, so maybe that will finally go through? Long story short: Plan is to keep him if he is playing well, but there is almost definitely a backup trade lined up if things don’t go well.

**Kevin Love**: Will we trade for Kevin Love?? No. I am incredibly against this idea, and our reporter said we haven’t discussed it, so that’s good news. However, like I said, Olshey has said someone fairly big trades fell through, so maybe this was one that we were/are pursuing.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,67054,public,self,What to expect from the re-vamped Portland Trail Blazers?,0,1570477743,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/de8bjy/what_to_expect_from_the_revamped_portland_trail/,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'moVIURlML9MwmoNdd51h6olCpool9AhJ7jPXo8KBtjc', 'resolutions': [{'height': 60, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/6MJVC6BeN8wl-NvOLwngpotca0AWMrX6JJmd1tfZH5o.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a41b89e6662dd2fd68276d783c998ef43ca67895', 'width': 108}, {'height': 121, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/6MJVC6BeN8wl-NvOLwngpotca0AWMrX6JJmd1tfZH5o.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8f62ab9a89419234b5f0e039607a9d04bd9e3ee', 'width': 216}, {'height': 180, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/6MJVC6BeN8wl-NvOLwngpotca0AWMrX6JJmd1tfZH5o.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fad99dd3ab1935c29b52d216b09ff4135bcc5d7d', 'width': 320}, {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/6MJVC6BeN8wl-NvOLwngpotca0AWMrX6JJmd1tfZH5o.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38d98d94bf200bb1e3a64235a00b387b29f43ca8', 'width': 640}, {'height': 540, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/6MJVC6BeN8wl-NvOLwngpotca0AWMrX6JJmd1tfZH5o.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2ade34994c32e3d12ecda3670e46b4c82859efb', 'width': 960}, {'height': 607, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/6MJVC6BeN8wl-NvOLwngpotca0AWMrX6JJmd1tfZH5o.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0464fcee3a523725569d2dff0ba47f6597437ba4', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 968, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/6MJVC6BeN8wl-NvOLwngpotca0AWMrX6JJmd1tfZH5o.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=c8b2d4bb1605de4b344714073634db2d7519f077', 'width': 1720}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,

- Feel like I'm cheating .a bit with Levert since he only played what like 40 games? Sorta kinda the same with Hayward since he came off the bench a ton last year but eh

- Levert, Hayward and Lowry all provide solid scoring options in the starting lineup while White leads the second team. The plan here would actually kinda be for Levert to stagger his minutes between the starting and bench lineups

- Two very good defensive point guards and power forwards with two of the best defenders in the game with Tucker and Draymond

- Feel wrong about leaving off Gary Harris but I kind of wanted a guy that I know that can put the ball in the hole and Levert gives that.

- The two wings in the bench unit may seem a weird inclusion, Bacon in particular but both are very solid shooters and Bacon can give it on both ends of the floor (obviously a bit of bias involved here)


- I feel bad for leaving off Brook Lopez, Sabonis, Otto Porter, and a couple of the Heat players (Adebayo, Olynyk), but I think I found an alright balance, I'm sure someone will come up with something better though

The GOAT conversation. LeBron being compared to Jordan and Kobe. But neither of those players is who LBJ most closely resembles. The man most clearly comparable to Bron Bron is, without question, Mr. Wilton Norman Chamberlain.

Let's start with high school. Both were once-in-a-generation recruits. Wilt was seen as a one-man revolution (""Can Basketball Survive Chamberlain?""), while LeBron was quite possibly the most hyped-up scholastic star in sporting history. Both also took accelerated routes to the pro ranks (LBJ going prep-to-pros after a failed attempt to enter the draft after his JUNIOR season, The Dipper dipping college after three years to spend a season with the Harlem Globetrotters before entering the Association). 

Once in the pros, the similarities between the legends only intensify. Both were drafted to their hometown franchises. Both struggled to win their first ring, drawing intense media scrutiny. Both had to leave their original team in order to get off the championship snide. However, both did ultimately raise a banner for their hometown (Wilt did so with the 76ers after being drafted by the Philly Warriors, but that franchise relocated to San Francisco three years after drafting the Stilt). On the subject of championships, both stars had their ring total significantly diminished by a super team (Russell's Cs for Wiltie, the Justice League Warriors for LeBronze). Both players were vehemently accused of choking in the clutch despite sterling statistics (with the exception of 2011 Bron; that criticism was clearly justified).

Moving away from the professional and on to the personal/trivial: both were labeled media-toxic at certain points in their careers. Both came to the Lakers at the tail-end of their primes, drawn by the liberality and off-the-court opportunities of LA. Both embraced Hollywood by staring in big-budget movies. Both were seen as freaks of nature: once-in-a-generation athletes capable of doing things only theorized and dreamed about before their conception. Both are/were incredibly polarizing figures in the sports world.

Some closing thoughts related to play style: both were/are incredible passers for their size/position. Both, at times, lacked the certain ""killer instinct"" that lay present in their rivals. Both put up unfathomable stats (sheer volume for Wilt, unheard-of balance for LeBron). 

The biggest similarity, I guess, is the sheer dominance. LBJ and Wilt are two of the three most dominant players ever (with Shaq, who is just Dippy 0.95 in my opinion). Sure, Jordan and Kobe were dominant. Unstoppable at many a time. But they did it with a combination of craft and vertical. Bron and the Dipper had both of those attributes in spades, but their defining characteristic is force. Strength. Athleticism.

# Notes

* I know we love to talk about Playoff LeBron, but Playoff Russell must have been quite something.
* Cliff Hagan, one of the players he was traded for, didn't do too badly either, appearing to outperform his more highly rated teammate, Bob Pettit, on a couple of occasions.
* 1967 Wilt might be the GOAT season.
* Kareem bursts onto the scene in 1970, but Oscar seems to be just as important to that incredible 1971 title team.
* Unseld may have been swept that year but did his best to prove his rookie MVP wasn't a fluke.
* [Looks like Frazier's claim to have sold hot-dogs at halftime isn't far off.](https://clutchpoints.com/knicks-news-walt-frazier-jokes-willis-reed-game-is-bullst-because-game-of-my-life/)

Since playoff games are all nationally broadcast and the first round alone represents a majority of playoff games, this isn’t going to happen, at least not in isolation. But what could be done?

If you reduce the first round of the playoffs to best-of-five, you end up eliminating up to 2 games from each of 8 series, or 16 games. If you take the bottom 16 teams in the league and put them in a single-elimination tournament, you get back 15 games. This tournament would both replace the draft lottery and decide the 8th playoff seeds. You could either seed the single-elimination tournament between the conferences or deliberately allow for a Western conference team to potentially play as the eighth seed in the East, or vice-versa.

For contending teams—most playoff teams, in fact—this eliminates 1-2 playoff games and provides a potential bye week between the regular season and playoffs. For the rest of the teams, it provides valuable “playoff” experience. For fans, it eliminates tanking and replaces a boring ceremony with an exciting tournament. And for the league, it leaves the total number of postseason games effectively unchanged (not all first round series go to 7 games in the first place) but replaces some boring early-playoff matchups with some do-or-die games.

FAQ:

Q. What if a team in the tournament already traded their first round pick?

A. The tournament decides the value of the “best” first round pick held by the team—decided by reverse order of team record—as of the beginning of the tournament. If the team doesn’t hold any first round picks for the next draft, they may instead choose to play for a special salary cap exception.

Q. How are the other picks ranked?

A. Reverse order of number of games won in the regular season. But the “best” of these picks would only be worth 17th overall.

Q. What about pick swaps and protections and other scenarios where a team might not have an incentive to play well in the tournament?

A. Either introduce the new format after a few years of banning these transactions or selectively nullify them in any situation where they would interfere with tournament incentives.

Suppose Phoenix trades their first round pick to the Clippers in exchange for the Clippers pick. Clippers end up with the #1 seed in the playoffs and have a tournament bye. Their pick—originally from Phoenix—is now the 17th overall. Phoenix holds the Clippers pick, and no other picks (for the sake of argument). Phoenix comes in fifth in the tournament. The Clippers pick—whose ranking the Suns played for—is now the 5th overall. If the Clippers pick had top-5 protection, or if the Clippers had the right to swap picks, that clause would be null and void so as to prevent the Suns from throwing the tournament. This sucks, so maybe just wait for all of these clauses to expire before changing formats.

Q. How do you rank a single elimination tournament?

A. Point difference. Of the eight teams that lose in the first round, the ninth place team is the one that lost by the fewest points. Second tiebreaker is the ranking of the team you lost to.

&gt; He is absolutely right in asking for this extension and it is up to the Raptors to decide if they are willing to bet that building the team around him is a good choice. Somethings to consider is that Raptors may not really have a choice: They aren't very successful in attracting FA and KL left this team **after** winning a ring. I'm not sure stars are too keen on moving to another country to play basketball. 

&gt; On the other hand their GM Masai Ujiri is amazing and I believe he can lead this team in the right direction. With how contracts and maxes are given out I think the Raptors/Masai will extend this or match him in RFA...and if they feel like they don't have enough to compete they will  likely trade him for some young players/picks.

For me:

Underrated: Utah Jazz

With all the crazy player movement in the West this year I feel like the substantial roster upgrades the Jazz made have been lost in the shuffle. Even in a loaded conference, I believe the Jazz will be a top three seed.

Conley is a huge upgrade over Rubio. Bogdanovic is also a major addition, and an elite knock down shooter. I am also expecting Mitchell to make another leap, and solidify himself as a true superstar, and one of the elite offensive forces in the NBA. If Gobert, who is in his prime, has another DPOY type season the Jazz project to be a top 10 team both offensively and defensively. The Jazz have elite top end talent, a deep and well rounded roster, and an excellent head coach. 


Overrated: Atlanta Hawks

I see alot of people projecting the Hawks to make a jump from last season, and compete for the 8th seed in the East. I don't see that happening. They project to be a bottom five team defensively, and with no real back up PG, will struggle mightily on offense when Young is not on the floor. 

Though they won 29 games last year, thier -6 differential is in line with a 25 win team.

I'm not sure how much news and expectation KAJ received his rookie year but I'm sure it was a lot, probably the same with Walton and Elvin Hayes.

Zion is the weird one obviously since the closest things we've seen to him is Charles Barkley. But i fee that Zion ceiling isn't as high as what the casual fans or media are making it out to be. They're saying that he'll be the next face of the NBA, this transcendental player, and i disagree. 

Zion is going to be good, but i see him more as a Blake Griffin tier player, this is not bad by any means. This is someone who can be a top 10 player in the NBA. But some things i feel that hold him back are his length and lack of perimeter play. Just like Ben Simmons and Giannis, Zion doesn't have the best perimeter game and that'll force teams to sag off of him and just guard the paint.  His length is also an issue as you saw in the Knicks vs Pelicans summer league game he got blocked around 4-5 times, 2-3 times in the paint by robinson, 1 time on the perimeter by robinson, and 1 time in the paint by Knox. We have to see how he adjusts to finishing against NBA bigs.

He's extremely strong and quick so transition scoring, rim running, and drawing fouls will be his forte, but unless he can get his perimeter scoring up, he wont be the player that the media is saying he'll be. He's also an under rated ball handler and passer. Due to the poor construction of Dukes team we did really see just how good of a ball handler he is, but i believe he's better than what the numbers say. 

Ceiling: If he develops that jump shot and avoids injury, top 3 player in the league, MVP candidate. Think Draymond Green with elite athleticism. 

Floor:  If he does not get that jumpshot going, top 18-23 player, high level defender, secondary playmaker, inside scorer. Think current Draymond Green

**Ja**

Ja Morant saw major improvements from his first to second year in college. Basically all counting stats and all major advance stats increased. His blazing quickness and elite athleticism allow him to get by almost any defender and his playmaking skills are ridiculous. I don't think people really talk about his play making or give him enough credit.

His jumpshot has improved and his free throw percentage is in the 80s so this is a good indication of NBA shooting. Overall he has the complete package. The worries are that the shooting doesn't translate over. That would make him heavily reliant on his athleticsm. Granted we seen guys like Derrick Rose get by but Rose is also one of the best finishers the NBA has ever seen. 

Ceiling: ~~If his shooting translates over he can be a top 10 player easily with his skill set. Think John Wall x DeAaron Fox blend.~~ **EDIT: Editing this as im typing it. I didn't talk much about his rebounding and totally forgot about it. I'll change my Ceiling to a top 7 player. Think of Russell Westbrook x DeAaron Fox**

Floor: If the shooting doesn't translate I think hes an all star (reserve not starter), top 25-30 guy. The athleticism and play making are still very good,  but not having the consistent jump shot can be a huge liability as teams can game plan and exploit that. Think early Jason Kidd minus the defense. 

**RJ**

Rj Barrett has the archtype of a Luka Doncic, James Harden, Manu Ginobli, Lamar Odom, kind of player. These guys are point forwards with high scoring ability (Odom wasn't a high scorer). The thing with RJ compared to the Zion and Ja is that hes a jack of all trades master of none kind of guy. He's not elite in any part of the game. Zion has his strength and athleticism, Ja has his passing and athleticism, RJ is good at almost everything just not elite at one thing. 

But this can be a positive for RJ as if he can develop well he can be a top 5 player and someone who can consistently drop triple doubles or close to it. Just to show what i mean, when Tre Jones went down, RJ Barrett became the main ball handler on Duke. The first game RJ dropped 23points 9 assists 16 rebounds. He dropped either double digit assists or rebounds 9 times in college, dropping 1 triple double, and many times came close to having another. 

With RJ, his ceiling very high but his floor can be very low. 

Ceiling: If he can become a become that triple double threat while shooting a respectable clip from 3, he can be an MVP candidate, top 5 player. Think James Hardenish. Although James Harden always had better shooting potential than RJ, i think this is as close as an elite comp as i can find. 

Floor: If his shooting doesn't translate. and cannot become a play maker he can bottom out at just a high level starter starter. Someone who can give you inefficient points, some rebounds, some assists, but nothing special. 

If i were to rank them on different categories i'd say

Shooting: Ja &gt; RJ &gt; Zion

Shot Creation: Ja = RJ &gt; Zion

Finishing: Zion &gt; Ja &gt; RJ

Defense: Zion &gt; RJ &gt; Ja

Playmaking: Ja &gt; RJ &gt; Zion

People wondered how two players who were so used to having the ball in their hands would coexist on the court. The answer is that Chris Paul basically became a role player when he shared the court with Harden (""/75"" means per 75 possessions):

|Chris Paul Stats|minutes|AST%|USG%|TS%|pts/75|reb/75|ast/75|to/75|
:--|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Paul 16-17 (Clippers)|1,921|46.8|24.4|61.4|21.5|5.9|11.0|2.9|
|Paul 17-18 Harden off|876|54.4|29.3|61.7|26.8|6.9|11.5|3.0|
|Paul 17-18 Harden on|970|26.8|19.1|58.5|16.3|5.5|6.7|2.1|
|Paul 18-19 Harden off|727|56.9|27.4|58.1|22.3|5.3|12.4|3.9|
|Paul 18-19 Harden on|1,130|27.8|18.5|54.0|14.4|5.0|7.1|2.3​|

Capela and Gordan each had more points per possesion than Paul when sharing the court with Harden and Paul over the last two seasons. Joe Ingles and Fred Van Vleet last season are two players with very similar AST%/USG% combos to Paul when he shared the court with Harden, to give an idea as to what kind of role that typically indicates. But when Paul played without Harden he took over the offense, with many of his number approaching or exceeding his career highs.

Harden's role also changed when playing with or without Paul, just not as dramatically, and he was able to lead the league in USG% for the first time in his career the last two seasons:

|James Harden Stats|minutes|AST%|USG%|TS%|pts/75|reb/75|ast/75|to/75|
:--|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Harden 16-17 (pre-Paul)|2,947|50.7|34.2|61.3|28.8|8.0|11.1|5.7|
|Harden 17-18 Paul off|1,581|54.0|37.4|60.8|32.5|6.1|10.2|5.2|
|Harden 17-18 Paul on|970|31.8|30.8|64.1|29.0|4.6|6.9|3.2|
|Harden 18-19 Paul off|1,737|47.7|42.7|62.1|39.2|7.1|8.5|5.5|
|Harden 18-19 Paul on|1,130|28.4|34.0|60.7|30.5|5.9|5.9|4.1​|

Harden broke the points per possession record and had the 2nd highest usg% ever with his combined stats last season, so the fact that his splits were so much higher in 1737 minutes without Paul is kinda crazy. 

The team's net rating was surprisingly consistent as long as one of these players was on the court over the two years combined. Offenses featuring only Paul fared worse than with Harden, but the only-Paul lineups were better enough on defense to more than make up for it:

|Players On|Players Off|Minutes|NetRtg|OffRtg|DefRtg|
:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|
|&amp;nbsp;James Harden|&amp;nbsp;Chris Paul|&amp;nbsp;3317|&amp;nbsp;7.16|&amp;nbsp;117.39|&amp;nbsp;110.23|
|&amp;nbsp;Chris Paul, James Harden||&amp;nbsp;2100|&amp;nbsp;9.17|&amp;nbsp;119.37|&amp;nbsp;110.20|
|&amp;nbsp;Chris Paul|&amp;nbsp;James Harden|&amp;nbsp;1603|&amp;nbsp;10.40|&amp;nbsp;114.67|&amp;nbsp;104.26|
||&amp;nbsp;Chris Paul, James Harden|&amp;nbsp;931|&amp;nbsp;-9.64|&amp;nbsp;102.32|&amp;nbsp;111.96|

There was an expectation that both players would create easier looks for each other, but that did not happen much. This was probably largely by design: they played an iso heavy my-turn-your-turn style. Both players were last in the league in the percent of their shots that were assisted both seasons. Their percentage of assisted shots went from extreme outlier level when they played without each other to last in the league level playing with each other. Paul only averaged 0.6 apg to Harden and Harden averaged 0.2 apg to Paul in the two combined seasons. Harden had less assists to Paul per possession than any other player he played significant minutes with in these seasons.

Perhaps resting during each other's possessions while sharing the court helped conserve energy and maintain higher offensive load. If this were the primary reason for their lack of two man game, we'd expect their usage to be lower in games they played with the other player injured or out compared to minutes played alone in games that both players played. However the opposite is true; Harden had higher USG% in both seasons in games that Paul did not play (37.6% and 43.7%) compared to minutes he played without Paul in games Paul did play, while Paul's was very close to the same (a bit over 28% overall) in 13 games in the reverse comparison scenario.

**Some takeaways:**

It seems Westbrook won't need to learn to play off the ball to replicate what Paul and Harden did. It will be difficult for Harden to assist Westbrook less than the 0.2 APG he threw to Paul. This is a reason to be optimistic for Rockets fans. 

A reason to be less optimistic is how much even Paul's low USG%/AST% lowered Harden's numbers when they shared the court last season. Westbrook so far in his career has been much less deferential than Paul, and if he tries to dominate the ball even half as much as he has throughout the rest of his career he will seriously eat into Harden's more efficient offense. The fact that Paul and Harden couldn't elevate each other's games much is not a good sign for Wesbtrook in this regard as well, as it's hard to see Westbrook succeeding where Paul failed considering Paul's superior shooting, defense, and general BBIQ (not that Wesbtrook has poor BBIQ, far from it, but Paul is among the all time greats in this regard). This matters more in the likely scenario that Westbrook takes on a larger portion of the shared offense than Paul attempted to.

Some may be surprised how good the Rockets were given the lack of evidence of synergy between Harden and Paul. However they had a very good roster, adding a top 5-10 player to what was a 55 win team in '17 without losing much. Harden and Capela also improved from '17. Sometimes just getting out of each other's way is enough.

Fans of the Thunder (or whatever team Paul ends up on) have reason to be optimistic with this data. Paul has been excellent in his minutes without Harden. He appears to have become somewhat underrated because of how much of a reduced role he had while playing with Harden. It remains to be seen if he can keep up that higher work load full time, but his 13 games played without Harden indicate he can at least still do it over (some) full games.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,66913,public,self,A look back at the Harden/Paul experiment (and what it might tell us about Harden/Wesbtrook),0,1570164946,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/dcm851/a_look_back_at_the_hardenpaul_experiment_and_what/,,,,,,,,,,,,

rTS: [Player's TS%]-[League TS%]

Offensive Load: An alternative to Usage Rate that takes into account shots created for a player's teammates in order to more accurately measure how much a player ""directly contributes to an individual possession."". You can read more about it [here](http://www.backpicks.com/2017/10/16/offensive-load-and-adjusted-tov/).

[PIPM](https://www.bball-index.com/player-impact-plus-minus/): All-In-One metric created by Nylon Calculus' and B-Ball Index's [Jacob Goldstein](https://twitter.com/jacobegoldstein?lang=en).

&gt; Player Impact Plus-Minus (PIPM for short) is a plus-minus impact metric that combines luck-adjusted plus-minus data with the value of the boxscore and a handful of interaction terms to estimate a player’s value over the course of a season.

Wins Added: An estimation of how many wins a player added to his team based on PIPM.

It is really stupid and they are biased

The excuses for this has been that he was carried by Shaq in his first three championships. This is not true as he came in clutch in many moments

Another thing I want too talk about are his stats which don't look too nice on paper (compared to Jordan, Lebron, Shaq etc) - 25.0ppg, 5.2rb, 4.7ast on 44.7% shooting. But numbers don't tell everything as he played in a very low scoring era ( [https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA\_stats\_per\_game.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats_per_game.html) ) and he was a player that had entire defences focus on just him (comparable to Lebron in early cavs days)

Also he only won MVP because he had so much competition and also because his team did not have a very good record (after shaq's departure). Kobe Bryant had to compete for MVP with Shaq, Dirk, Tim Duncan, Allen Iverson, Kevin Garnett and may more) as well as having to match-up with other elite guards like D-Wade, AI, Tmac, VInce carter, ray allen and ginobili. (It is a similar case for both Lebron and Jordan, even though MJ did have it a bit easier). Even still he finished top 5 in MVP voting 11 times which is 3rd (I think) behind Lebron - 13 and KAJ - 15.

Another thing Kobe had going for him was his clutchness which cannot be put into stats as it is not just buzzer beaters.

Due to this I have him 3rd on my list behind Jordan and James but I am willing to push him down to as low as 5th all time

Essentially it's point differential plus the weighted regular season SRS of their playoff opponent(s).

Unlike my previous system it makes no attempt at all to account for trades or injuries.

# Notes:

* As is to be expected, the champion was ranked in the top two every single year - except 1970, where the Knicks are unfairly penalised for facing Wilt in the playoffs after he played just 12 regular season games for the Lakers. The 1965 Celtics are underrated for a similar reason, being pushed to the limit by the Sixers, to whom Wilt had been traded midseason.
* The Celtics topped the league for 9 of their 11 championships, but often by quite small margins, as they regularly survived elimination games.
* The 1971 Bucks have the highest rating (+15.6) for a title-winner, which shouldn't be surprising, as they also hold the record for highest regular season SRS (+11.9) - narrowly ahead of the 1996 Bulls (+11.8). This probably understates their 'true' strength, but is bested by only 7 post-1973 playoff runs: 2001 Lakers (+20.5); those Bulls again (+19.4), their Utah opponents (+16.7) and their 1991 incarnation (+18.1); the 2017 and 2018 Warriors (+17.7 and +15.9 respectively); and 2014 Spurs (+16.9).
* At the other end of the spectrum lie the 1958 Cincinnati Royals (-20.8), absolutely devastated by the loss of Maurice Stokes, [whose BPM could have been massive](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/dabgtw/historical_boxscore_plusminus_19521973/).
* The 1955 Dolph Schayes-led Syracuse Nationals rank as the weakest champion (+3.6).
* One year later George Mikan came out of retirement to lead the Minneapolis Lakers in the strongest non-championship run, losing two one-point games to Bob Pettit's Hawks either side of a 58pt win in a best of three.
* Historical curiosities: the 10-team playoff in 1950 was as a result of the shortlived Central Division, there was a round-robin format in 1954, and it was impossible for the top two seeds to meet in the 1947 or 1948 Finals.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,66859,public,self,BAA/NBA Playoff SRS [1947-73],0,1570111548,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/dcanxo/baanba_playoff_srs_194773/,,,,,,,,,,,,

At least the East had variety- the West save for two Dallas years was basically predictable and stale unless you rooted for L.A. or San Antonio.

I’ve heard many people call this contract the worst of 2019 Free Agency period, a take which I believe is ridiculous for many reasons. In some ways I actually heavily like this move by Charlotte. I’ve outlined my reasons 

1. Charlotte was about to lose Walker for nothing. They had a gaping hole at the starting PG position and there weren’t many viable options out there, especially considering their lack of an attractive market. 
2. Rozier is only 25 years old and matches up well in age with the rest of the Hornets’ young core.
3. While Rozier has had a turbulent time in the league numbers wise, his 2018 postseason numbers (16.2, 5.6, 5.2) were no fluke. He’s shown the potential to lead and put up nice numbers when he’s given full control of a team, and Charlotte will give him just that. 
4. This contract is only three years, and the Hornets aren’t competing for anything anytime soon. Not to mention much of they have money to spend with much of their albatross contracts coming off the books the next two summers. 
5. Rozier would be heavily compelled to re-sign with Charlotte should he transform into a starting-caliber guard (a huge conditional, but still a very valid point). Remember that much of his trouble in Boston was due to the fact that they never prioritized him. Loyalty clearly matters to him. 

All in all, this is a very low risk, high reward move to me. If Rozier doesn’t perform, you can cut your losses and move on. If he does, you have a franchise point guard on a rather nice salary considering the max deals that have gone out.

rTS: [Player's TS%]-[League TS%]

Offensive Load: An alternative to Usage Rate that takes into account shots created for a player's teammates in order to more accurately measure how much a player ""directly contributes to an individual possession."". You can read more about it [here](http://www.backpicks.com/2017/10/16/offensive-load-and-adjusted-tov/).

[PIPM](https://www.bball-index.com/player-impact-plus-minus/): All-In-One metric created by Nylon Calculus' and B-Ball Index's [Jacob Goldstein](https://twitter.com/jacobegoldstein?lang=en).

&gt; Player Impact Plus-Minus (PIPM for short) is a plus-minus impact metric that combines luck-adjusted plus-minus data with the value of the boxscore and a handful of interaction terms to estimate a player’s value over the course of a season.

Wins Added: An estimation of how many wins a player added to his team based on PIPM.

Below I've listed the results.  If a player was actually voted to the all defensive team that year, I put their name in **bold.**  Obviously I realize PIPM is just one stat that doesnt tell the whole story and being the 3rd best player by that stat at your position could clearly still mean you are a candidate for a selection, but for the sake of this exercise, I just did top 4 guards, top 4 forwards and top 2 centers by that metric, just to see if there were any big correlations or any big differences.  At the bottom, I put my personal (subjective) all defensive teams for this century (1999/2000-2018/2019) I put 4 teams since it's quite a long period.  These were again, subjective, and I used a combination of peak and longevity, my personal eye test and bias, along with their playoff defense/production.  

&amp;#x200B;

Going over these, a few things stuck out.  Jason Kidd, Kevin Garnett, and Tim Duncan all had incredible longevity on the defensive end of the floor.  While obviously their athleticism waned, they maintained excellent production on that end of the floor.  These 3 were far and away the best at their positions.  I also noticed that the voting ""rules"" are quite lax.  3 times  in the 20 year period there was a tie, and instead of having any tiebreaking system or simply putting one on first and one on second team, they simply put 6 players on the team and 5 on the second team which I find odd.  Additionally, there is a lot of leniency in terms of position, both between G/F and F/C.  In terms of individuals whose metrics varied immensely from the voting, Andrew Bogut was one of the best centers ever by PIPM but only made a few teams, and Kobe Bryant received quite a few selections despite being a negative player for most of his career by that metric. 

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of correlation, for this sample: Guards had the lowest, with the voting matching the metrics 28% of the time.  I think this is due to a few factors, firstly, PIPM very much favors players on great defensive teams, which is much more dirrectly related to rim protection and the center, so PIPM might have Manu Ginobili as one of the best defensive guards ever because he played a lot with Duncan.  I also think it's harder to evaluate guard defense.  Many people just look at steals or man to man defense when things like rotations, staying in front, and sound positioning and rebounding might be better things to look at when evaluating.   Forwards had a 40% match and Centers matched the metric 46% of the time.  This was quite surprising to me.  I also think that the voters are looking at metrics more recently (which is good imo).  From 2015-2019 there was a 48% correlation between the players voted and the players at the top of the metric, while for 2000-2009 there was only a 33% correlation.  One last little fun fact.  I think it's amazing that the one year that John wall was rated as an excellent defender he was voted in.  He didn't have any other selections based on reputation after that, nor did he have any PIPM years over 2. Here are the teams

Seems like you bump up guys who play with another star on teams that will be really good (like PG), and downgrade guys like Dame who are awesome players on teams that won't win the finals.

My top ten, roughly:

1. Giannis Antetokounmpo: The only player who is the clear top dog on a top tier finals contender, imo.

2. Kawhi Leonard: I'm not all in on the Clippers, but he edges out the Lakers duo, who are in similar positions as one of the top two dogs on a true finals contender but share their FMVP likelihood a little more equally than Leonard and George.

3. Lebron James: Playoff Lebron

4. Anthony Davis: Might not have the narrative, but it's not hard to envision a world in which he absolutely wrecks Embiid/Giannis in a finals series and the numbers are too good to ignore.

5. Steph Curry: As many here are probably aware, Curry and Green's on/off numbers are world shattering. GSW might not be the one seed, but they'll be fine. Then they get Klay back in plenty of time for the playoffs, meaning the core of their 73 win team is back, plus Russell, WCS, Looney, etc. This is still a serious finals contender, and if they do pull it off, Steph is a lock.

6. James Harden: Same logic as Steph -- they are a legit contender, and if Houston wins it, Harden is almost certainly FMVP. He ranks just below Steph because I like GSW slightly better and because he stands a slightly higher likelihood of winning the finals but losing FMVP given Russ' presence.

7. Joel Embiid: Obligatory nod to best player on a serious finals contender. Even if Sixers take it home, though, he could absolutely cede this award to Simmons/Harris/Horford.

8. Paul George: If Kawhi has a choppy finals but Clippers pull it out anyways, then FMVP is all Playoff P's.

9. Khris Middleton: Quietly outperformed Giannis at moments in last year's playoffs and has a knack for big shots in big moments. If the Bucks win a title, and Middleton is 1b to Giannis' 1a rather than a true supporting player, a couple clutch shots could push him over the edge.

10. Bradley Beal: A big shot maker who could end up on any number of finals contenders -- been linked to Lakers, Nugs, Jazz, even Bucks a bit. If he lands on Denver or Utah I think he becomes their most likely FMVP candidate, but this could be the case in a lot of his different landing spots.

I didn't include anyone on Denver because I don't believe in them as serious finals contenders (barring a Beal trade) or Utah because I think the three main guys share the MVP likelihood a little too evenly.

Glossary:

rTS: [Player's TS%]-[League TS%]

Offensive Load: An alternative to Usage Rate that takes into account shots created for a player's teammates in order to more accurately measure how much a player ""directly contributes to an individual possession."". You can read more about it [here](http://www.backpicks.com/2017/10/16/offensive-load-and-adjusted-tov/).

[PIPM](https://www.bball-index.com/player-impact-plus-minus/): All-In-One metric created by Nylon Calculus' and B-Ball Index's [Jacob Goldstein](https://twitter.com/jacobegoldstein?lang=en).

&gt; Player Impact Plus-Minus (PIPM for short) is a plus-minus impact metric that combines luck-adjusted plus-minus data with the value of the boxscore and a handful of interaction terms to estimate a player’s value over the course of a season.

Wins Added: An estimation of how many wins a player added to his team based on PIPM.

They drafted Wade Baldwin at 17, who they waived after one season, and who is now out of the league. they could have had Siakam or Lavert.

They traded the clippers 2019 first (#20) for 32 and 35. 

They picked deyonta davis at 32, and waived him after two seasons, he's now out of the league. They could have picked Zubac who was picked next.

They picked Rade Zagorac with 35, who they signed and waived before the season started, and he never played in the league. They could have picked brogdon, who was picked next.

There you have it. Three players, all who weren't good enough to play in the league drafted on one night, and a traded away 1st rounder.

I remember in 2012 Nash/Howard et al went to the Lakers, and it seemed like nothing else mattered. Except, of course, a Thunder team that had just made it to the Finals. And yet that was the year Steph Curry would break the three point shooting record, bring GS back into the playoffs, and begin an era of dominance. The Thunder and Lakers flameouts have been mostly forgotten now. 

Maybe it's not quite that big of a story (lol), but for my Blazers I have to say it's Anfernee Simons. One of our more skeptical beat reporters was interviewing players after practice, and he asked guys if the hype train had gone off the rails a little about this kid. To the contrary, people were saying he was the best player in the gym at times. 

Portland has a history of making the most of underappreciated guards, even aside from Dame and CJ. Connaughton, Crabbe, Barton, Frazier, Hood...guys come here and they play well. Simons looked so smooth in summer league--he just had an ""it"" about him I hadn't seen since Dame. Lillard himself has said he sees Simons carrying the torch when his own career starts winding down. 

Portland's guard-heavy offense seems tailor-made for Simons to come off the bench and gun away. So I'm looking at this a lot like when Wes Matthews left and space was created for CJ to flourish. I really think Portland is going to use him as a microwave off the bench, and he's a dark horse for MIP.

Mike was the greatest SG who ever played. So we idolized the standard he set for us. It changed how we played and many players wanted to mimic his play style. He was damn near perfect. 


Personally I believe Lebron is the best SF to play the game. There’s not much room for improvement, as Lebron had few weaknesses in his game. 
But does that mean Lebron is the ultimate depiction of the ideal SF?

Glossary:

rTS: [Player's TS%]-[League TS%]

Offensive Load: An alternative to Usage Rate that takes into account shots created for a player's teammates in order to more accurately measure how much a player ""directly contributes to an individual possession."". You can read more about it [here](http://www.backpicks.com/2017/10/16/offensive-load-and-adjusted-tov/).

[PIPM](https://www.bball-index.com/player-impact-plus-minus/): All-In-One metric created by Nylon Calculus' and B-Ball Index's [Jacob Goldstein](https://twitter.com/jacobegoldstein?lang=en).

&gt; Player Impact Plus-Minus (PIPM for short) is a plus-minus impact metric that combines luck-adjusted plus-minus data with the value of the boxscore and a handful of interaction terms to estimate a player’s value over the course of a season.

Wins Added: An estimation of how many wins a player added to his team based on PIPM.

There are many publicly available sources for RAPM these days, but I've found only [one that separates regular season from playoffs](https://basketball-analytics.gitlab.io/rapm-data/). The basic flaw with this approach is that it assumes all playoff teams start off created equal, so over this time period it is very likely to overrate the Eastern Conference and underrate the Western Conference. Nevertheless, as a measure of sheer playoff dominance it may provide some insight:

Overall I'm not too displeased with the outcome, considering the small sample size - [probably only slightly worse than the regular season version I did last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/97ruut/20_years_of_rapm_mvps_19972017/). 14 of the 23 were on championship teams, with a further four coming from finalists. Mostly stars are represented, and while Tayshaun Prince may have been the lone non-Allstar on that Detroit team, they lacked depth at the small forward position compared to their bigs and guards.

The popularity of a stat does not change how accurately it can predict winning. The popularity of a player's ranking does not magically make it objective.  If someone can make a consistent well supported argument for a stance that is wildly unpopular, that doesn't change the validity of the stance. If they can't, then you shouldn't have to bring up popular opinion in the first place.

1. IDK in five years but two years I still think Curry will be great. If he stays healthy I just think his shooting and offensive game will be hard to stop. I just think he has the ability to lead and carry a team.

2. Kyrie- Nets fan and do believe in his talents. I won't lie I have personal opinons on him but I resepct he can be really good. I can far and say he might have future best PG in the game status, but I think he gets overrated by fans a lot cause of his offensive game. Defense is still not good and I don't think he is an amazing plamaker though he can.

3. Simmons- I honestly hate Simmons a lot, but I resepct he has potential. I don't see him being a scoring PG even with a jumper, but I do believe he is an amazing passer and potentially the best passer in the game if he establishes that. Also his defensive abilites is amazing. I think he can be really good as a PG and I hate him.

4. Young- I think after three, list can vary but I think Young has that modern offensive feel to him and has that aurora to him. He can score but seems like he can be a great floor general as well. I think he can elevate Atlanta and be a great star for them.

5. Fox- Very Westbrook like in a way but seems to have the total package as a PG. Unsure but he seems to have that ability to score, pass, play decent defense, and has good skills with his atheltic ability.

6. D lo- I might be biased as I am a fan of his. He honestly is still my favorite player, but I really think he can be a very good player. I know people think he is serevly overrated, but what he did last year wasn't just a joke. I don't think many players could do some of the games he did. If he just works on getting better at the rim and as much better defensively as he can, I really think he could be better. His finishing is hard to predict, but I just feel more agressiveness even if poor conversions can make him better. I think his midrange and shooting is really good, but I really think in the future he can be a top three passer in the NBA. I just see him a lot like Young where they are both so modern but old school in style.

  7.Morant- Need to see more, but from some games and analysis, he seems very athletic but has very good skills. He might be farther but need to see more.

8. Will give Lillard respect and 8 might be a bit harsh, but I do feel it's very possible that in five to even two years he dwindles down.

9.Jammal Murray- He be really good too, but I just don't think he has the superstar ability to be higher.

10. I'm not sure

Thought this would be interesting to look at! I've taken the lineups from [this site](https://www.lineups.com/nba/rosters) and included anyone with a rating over 75 (would've done higher, but the rating's are pretty awful tbh). If there's anyone who is a major omission let me know, or if there are players who are no longer in the league (i.e. Tony Parker, Udoh and Jerebko were all in) I can take them out.

Another critique is the NBA Playoffs feels too long lasting almost around 2 months on average which feels like another season of its own.

Why doesn't the NBA just have the top 4 teams in each conference make the playoffs. Get rid of the 1st round, the NBA playoffs would be just as long as March Madness and this would make the regular season more fun because teams that are 5-8 seeded are gonna fight like hell to get that 4th seed which would not let the top seeded teams rest their best players for load management throughout the regular season. And you could now stretch the regular season out until the date where the first round ends giving the players an extra 10 days of rest resulting in less back to backs in the regular season or have the MVP Awards Night before the playoff dead period which will add more narratives to the playoffs (Ex: Can he live up to the MVP against the runner up? We're about to find out...)

Only the top 8 elite teams should make the NBA playoffs just like the top 4 elite teams make the College Football Playoff. This is something Adam Silver should let be a 1-2 year experiment and if the ratings are higher and the fans like it then keep it. Remember the NBA Playoffs used to be a best of 7 games, 8 team format from 1970-1974 although there were only 14 teams.

Win Shares are no longer a highly-regarded stat. But pre-1974 Win Shares make modern Win Shares look like multiyear luck-adjusted prior-informed real plus-minus. Without steals, blocks, offensive rebounds or turnovers we're basically sailing blind.

# Method

However, using several assumptions basketball-reference makes in its calculations, it is possible to produce a bastardised version of BPM in a similar way. Testing out of sample for the 1978 and 1979 (the only years where individual turnovers were tracked before the 3pt era) produced an r\^2 of 0.73 with proper BPM, whereas WS to WS was only 0.50 over the same period. Before 1952 the NBA didn't track minutes played or rebounds, so I stopped there, as it would have required further drastic changes to the formula (sorry Mikan!).

# Conclusions

* Oscar looks fantastic partially as a result of his strong AST\*REB term but he really was that good.
* This adds some nuance to the Russell/Wilt debate. While Wilt still looks stronger, Russell comes out ahead in four out of the ten years they were both in the league (as opposed to only once by WS). This is also more in line with their MVP finishes (except swapping 1960 for 1963).
* In fact in general it mirrors MVP voting more closely than WS does. Unseld and Cousy look less ridiculous, though Cowens still stands out.
* Players with known outlier-level steal/block levels (Russell, West, Nate, Wilt) will be underrated.
* Counterintuitively, the overall r\^2 was higher than the individual components, so feel free to shift a couple of points from offence to defence or vice versa.
* RIP Maurice Stokes.

Fun Fact, the raptors won at a 63 win pace without kawhi.

Here's another one, the raptors and the bucks were tied when both kawhi and giannis were on the floor. Overall, the bucks were +13 with Giannis while the raps were +16 with kawhi. IOW, kawhi, with the significantly better supporting cast, couldn't outscore the bucks when giannis was on the floor and even when we ignore his greater minutes vs the buck's bench, his team managed to outscore the bucks by a whopping half a point over 6 games. The series overall was decided by one point per game. Given this sub's insistince that giannis was ""dominated"", clearly outplayed, and clearly doesn't belong in the dicussion with players like lebron, kawhi, kd, and curry, it's pretty odd giannis's team was able to play the champs to a draw when he was playing.

It's almost like using the box score is a silly way to compare a two way defensive anchor who anchored a +9 playoff defense to one way offensive dynamos. FYI, here was kawhi's and Giannis's *box(biased towards offense)* stats when both were on the court:

&gt;Giannis averaged 22.0/12.0/4.7 per 36 on 53.1 TS% with a 16.8 TOV% with Kawhi on the floor.  
Kawhi averaged 25.7/8.6/3.5 56.4 TS% with a 10.9 TOV% with Giannis on the floor.

Teams are starting to play smaller lineups with more skilled players over bigger ones. Teams have found increased spacing and faster pace when they switch to using a small-ball lineup. The Warriors have been one of the biggest beneficiaries of this trend. By replacing Draymond with Bougt/Lee, the Warriors have changed the NBA landscape. Their fast pace and spacing were able to lead them to a 73-9 record and 3 championships. However, just because the Warriors were sucessful in using small-ball doesn't mean that most teams should replicate it.

The Warriors are fortunate to have a rare wing-big hybrid in Draymond Green and switchable defender in Andre Igoudala. Draymond's ability to handle the ball, run in transition and defend big and rebound is the catalyst of the Warriors small-ball strategy. Without Draymond rare ability to play like a point forward and guard bigs, the Warriors would not be able to run this lineup. I have seen multiple teams try to copy the Warriors small ball formula but it doesn't work well.

The big problem is post defense. Teams that try to run small will almost always get eaten alive by a competent big man. The Brooklyn Nets got eaten alive by Embiid and Boban during the playoffs because they couldn't defend the post. The Nets tried playing small ball lineups with Dudley or another wing that could shoot at the 5, but it didn't work. The Nets couldn't defend the post and got killed on the boards, leading to their playoff exit.

Another problem with running small ball is rebounding. The Houston Rockets were one of the worst rebounding teams in the NBA, mainly because their starting lineup was small. Capela is only 6'10 and besides him, everyone in their startline lineup was 6'6 or shorter. Harden- 6'6, Tucker- 6'5, Paul-6'0, Gordon- 6'4. Kevon Looney and Draymond outrebounded the Rockets in the playoffs and the lack of size of the Rockets and their inability to get boards cost them the series. 

The truth, is that most teams don't have a Draymond type player, someone who is mobile and can run like a wing, but can defend bigs competently. Even the Warriors started to move away from small ball by giving Looney and Jordan Bell more minutes in the 2019 playoffs. There are a lot of benefits to playing big. For example, the Sixers were able to neutralize the Raptors offense based on their size. VanVlett, Green, Lowry and Siakam all struggled offensively because they were being defended by players much bigger than them. However, the Raptors were actually able to stop the Sixers by playing Gasol and Ibaka together and running multiple bigs together.  Also, the Bucks have embraced running big as well. Giannis has run at PG and they often run lineups with a lot of size and length, sometimes running Lopez and Illyavsova/Mirotic. This is one of the reasons that the Bucks were 1st defensively in 2019. 

If a team doesn't have someone that can play small ball 4/5 competently, they are much better off playing big because of the benefits on defense and rebounding.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,66552,public,self,Is Small ball overrated?,0,1569698639,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/da57lo/is_small_ball_overrated/,,,,,,,,,,,,

The greatest players sometimes aren't the absolute most talented. For example, i feel that Steph Curry is more talented than Magic Johnson, but Magic Johnson is the greater player due to having high talent AND more accomplishments.

Talking from strictly talent and completely ignoring accomplishments and accolades as much as possible, who are the most talented players to ever play at each position?

I'll go ahead and try to list/rank around 3 per position to get the conversation started. I'm 100% open to changing this list as i'm expecting to miss a ton of players who should be here

Some of my initial thoughts

* I don't think Steph Curry is a top 10 player all time and i don't feel that he should be ranked higher than Kevin Durant. Kevin Durant has been an elite player earlier in his career and longer than Curry, and they both peaked around the same with Curry having a more efficient one. Both top 20, can argue top 15. But i don't see top 10
* I'd put Hakeem over David Robinson. I think hes a better player than Duncan, but Duncan's longevity and accolades are better than Hakeem, i'd throw him at number 10 at least if it were me.
* I'd put both Karl and Moses Malone above Charles Barkley. But i'd understand if you'd want to keep Chuck above them. Its very close between them.
* I think Westbrook is too high. His individual numbers are good but his team success is severely lacking. They use the argument of Isiah Thomas not being efficient as one of the reasons why hes number 47, so why is Westbrook so high? 
* I think Isiah Thomas and Walt Frazier are severely disrespected on this list. Isiah Thomas has Stockton, CP3, Nash, Westbrook, and Kidd ahead of him and hes better and more accomplished than all of them. They use this ""efficiency"" argument with Thomas but fail to see that he has 2 MVP's, 2 rings, 1 finals MVP. If you combine the 5 guys i mentioned accolades together you get 3 MVPs, 1 ring... thats it. As for Fraizer, he has to be somewhere around the Jason Kidd, Steve Nash range. When looking at counting stats, he loses due to his assist numbers being lower. But he also has 2 rings and is the best or second best PG defender ever (Gary Payton is the only one with an arguement).

Pretty much biggest issue here is determining his value. On one side for some other team he might be worth giving max contract but maybe for Celtics who payed Kemba this summer, still have two years of Hayward's contract and will have to pay Tatum next year that's too much and doing so will give them no flexibility to improve in the future. 

Jaylen as a player broke out in 17/18 season after Hayward went down but as entire Celtic squad last year he couldn't replicate that form and chemistry issues were showing as I guess they couldn't get the roles on the court settled as bunch of players had similar number of shot attempts per game last season. Even though now with Kemba replacing Kyrie and Morris and Horford gone ball distribution will be more clear still I think that Kemba and Tatum will be first and second options for Celtics. 

Personally I can imagine some team nex summer giving him a max contract (especially teams like the Raptors having all the space in the world to sign players and to be honest I can imagine him and Siakam being a good duo) so the Celtics will have a tough decision. For them maybe it makes no sense to give him max money but it sure doesn't make sense to lose him for nothing. Last year with Smart they played the waiting game and managed to tie him down on a decent contract for both sides but I think that demand for Brown will be much bigger. Maybe it's time for them to consider trade talk with interested teams who will pay him that money nex summer and Celtics can get some pieces to put around their current roster (much needed help in the frontcourt now)

Thought it would be interesting to see who we predict will be NBA All-Star's this year, so I've created this poll.

The players listed were from [this roster site](https://www.lineups.com/nba/rosters), with anyone over a '75' rating included, with a few big positional changes (e.g. Butler and Doncic were both guards on here, but were frontcourt on the ballots last year). Would've liked to do a higher cutoff so there's less obvious deadweight in the poll, but the rating system was pretty awful. If there's any major omissions let me know!

The truth is that the Blazers were destroyed by a Warriors squad sans KD that was similar strength to the current top teams in the west (Lakers, Clippers, Rockets etc). A similar iteration of this team was also swept by a relatively weak Pelicans team missing one of their top players, and this was back when they had Nurkic.

The rules are simple:

* Every day there will be a new poll for the next ranking. Tomorrow's poll will decide the second best player in the league, after that, the third, and so on until we hit 25. 

* The winner of the poll will be removed from consideration for the next one. New players will be added as options to the next poll along with the players who didn't win the previous one. 

* Comment which player(s) you think should be added as options for tomorrows poll and I will include them. 

* Voting ends at 1:00 PM Eastern Standard Time. 

The first 5 candidates are the Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis, James Harden, LeBron James, and Kawhi Leonard. I picked these guys since they're the ones who come up the in Top 3 player conversations most often.

&gt; Iggy is a very valuable player. He is a vet who can provide a team with solid minutes off the bench or even starter minutes during the playoffs. Very sound fundamental defender, can space the floor, and is an asset on both ends of the floor. *The question is what teams could really use him?*

&gt; Obviously teams that are contending could use him the most. He isn't the type of player who is going to take raise the floor of a team but will definitely raise their ceiling meaning he isn't going to take teams into the playoffs or anything but will definitely fill the holes for many teams and make them stronger. 

&gt; Therefore teams not contending will most likely not trade for him considering **his contract is 17 million** but this also means teams that are contending don't have the flexibility to trade for him either. They either don't have the assets or it would be addition by subtraction. 

&gt; Grizzlies are not going to buy him out till the last minute which is their best move and assuming no team come forward with a good enough trade. They will try to buy him out.

**Where is he likely going to sign after his buyout?**

&gt; The three options that stand out to me are: Lakers, Clippers, and Rockets. These are the most attractive options for him I believe. 

&gt; Lakers: They could really use him/need him. He would be essential in guarding elite wings and Lakers don't have any in that regard. He would see the most minutes and action here especially if going against Clippers. 

&gt; Rockets: Their defense is questionable depending on the lineup. If Harden and WB are on the floor at the same time who would play the 3? Gordon is too small to be effective there and this is where Iggy would come in and not to mention he has the experience to hopefully see them through to the Finals. 

&gt; Clippers: I think this is the team that least *needs* him. This team already has great depth at that position and their primary concern is at the 5 and play makers.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,66400,public,self,Where will Andre Iguodala likely end up this season?,0,1569422824,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/d8o7u3/where_will_andre_iguodala_likely_end_up_this/,,,,,,,,,,,,

This off-season saw the end of  the warriors'  great small forward combo, both KD and Iguodala left and now they have very few options at that postion. Right now their options to start at the 3 are Alfonzo McKinnie, Glen Robinson and maybe Alec Burkes. McKinnie would be a fine option if they had him as filler with a player that can handle big minutes from the bench, but in their current state he could have to play more minutes than what you want him to play. I liked Robinson from the little I saw of him in Detroit last season he was a good defender altough terrible in the offense, that shouldnpt be as bad in the GSW system. That said, he isn't the guy you want guarding the west's superstar forwards (LBJ, PG, Kawhi) so then draymond takes that responsibility and you have a PF or C feasting on the smaller Robinson. Finnaly Burks, he shouldn't play at the forward at all imo, last year with the cavs he had to fill that role since our only other 3 was Cedi and it looked bad (even by 2018-2019 Cavs standard) he was way more effective and confortable playing the 2.

So, you just move Draymond or Klay to the 3 right? The problem there is that [Draymond is not good at that position, which he has said himself](https://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/253605/Draymond-Green-Playing-Small-Forward-As-A-Rooke-Almost-Had-Me-Out-Of-NBA). On the other hand, you have Klay who actually played a lot of 3 in 2016 and it makes a lot of sense to have D'lo at the 2 and Klay at the 3. In fact, that may as well be the obvious answer to this question, but Klay isn't going to be there for most of the season and come playoff time I don't think you want your player coming off an ACL injury to be the primary defender on LeBron, one of Kawhi and PG13 or Harden, specially when he will have a considerable offensive responsibility.

This all leads to the actual reason I made this post.  Should the warriors have kept Iguodala? His contract is pretty terrible and I understand why they dumped him but whenever I see their lineup for this season I can't help but think they have a massive gap that he could have filled and that the players they got with their extra space aren't going to make much of difference in tackling this problem.

Over at r/nbaranking I asked a panel to predict their top 100 players for the 2019-2020 season. 

This led to some rather interesting results, and over the next 2-3 days I am going to reveal the top 140 players based on the results of this survey!

&amp;#x200B;

***These were the 40 players outside of the top 100:***

&amp;#x200B;

**140. Kyle Korver (Milwaukee Bucks)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 170)*

Now 38 years old, Korver is expected to play a humongous role for the Bucks this upcoming season. Although he will turn 39 next February, his 3 point ability is still near-elite. This upcoming season he is expected to pass 1,200 career NBA games played which is incredible.

**139. Rodney Hood (Portland Trail Blazers)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 154)*

Having played for 3 teams the past 3 seasons, with improved efficiency in 3 point shooting Hood's value will increase.

**138. Reggie Jackson (Detroit Pistons)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 109)*

An example of a guy who would have been an all star had he been playing 10 years ago.

**137. OG Anunoby (Toronto Raptors)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 130)*

One thing is for sure: he's going to get his chance to shine. I always thought ""Kawhi-like"" even before Kawhi went to Toronto. I would not be surprised to see him break out as a top 100 player.

**136. Dennis Schroder (Oklahoma City Thunder)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 117)*

What I said for Jackson applies here as well.

**135. Jarrett Culver (Minnesota Timberwolves)**

*(ROOKIE)*

Culver gets respect early and I have an eerie feeling that, although the odds are against this, he could end up being the missing long-term piece to fit nicely next to KAT.

**134. Frank Ntilikina (New York Knicks)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 337)*

One of the more unique and surprising additions, Ntilikina's World Cup performance was for real and opened up the eyes to a lot of people in regards to his talent.

**133. Tim Hardaway Jr (Dallas Mavericks)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 136)*

How does someone who scores 18 PPG finish this low? 34% career 3 point shooting affects his value.

**132. Dewayne Dedmon (Sacramento Kings)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 148)*

Dedmon is likely going to have the biggest role of his career, I am very intrigued to see how it works out.

**131. JaVale McGee (LA Lakers)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 129)*

Once a laughing stock, McGee has become a respected veteran center by the casual fan.

**130. Rui Hachimura (Washington Wizards)**

*(ROOKIE)*

The star for Japan in the World Cup, all eyes will be on him in DC. At the very least he will give the team more media attention.

**129. Al Farouq Aminu (Orlando Magic)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 115)*

Although kind of a meh signing, he was a legit top 100 candidate last season and he helps with the front court depth tremendously.

**128. Rajon Rondo (LA Lakers)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 165)*

No player's stock has swung as wildly the past 3 years as Rondo's has, but with the Lakers rejuvenated Rondo could be an impact player for a playoff team this upcoming season.

**127. Jerami Grant (Denver Nuggets)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 94)*

After cracking the top 100 last year, Grant doesn't even crack the top 125 preseason. He had a career year the previous season and Denver will be counting on him in 2019-2020.

**126. Kelly Oubre Jr (Phoenix Suns)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 122)*

Although inefficient, what puts him a little above players like THJ and Reggie Jackson is his overall versatility, age, and long term potential could give him a chance at the top 100 in 2019-2020.

**125. Wendell Carter Jr (Chicago Bulls)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 146)*

Progression is expected for the sophomore in 2019-2020. If he can stay healthy, a top 100 finish is at least a possibility.

**124. Terrence Ross (Orlando Magic)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 111)*

Stepping up in a contract year received him a new contract. If Orlando wants to improve upon last season, Ross becoming a top 100 talent wouldn't hurt.

**123. Bogdan Bogdanovic (Sacramento Kings)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 120)*

He showed serious potential at times. More consistency and his progression moving upwards will make Sacramento smile.

**122. Jonathan Isaac (Orlando Magic)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 138)*

Although slowly improving, he's improving. He appeared on 4 ballots total and a 3rd year leap to top 100 level would not surprise me.

**121. TJ Warren (Indiana Pacers)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 108)*

If healthy, probably would have been a top 100 lock last year. Before injury he was playing the best basketball of his career.

**120. Andre Iguodala (""Memphis Grizzlies"")**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 104)*

Trade rumors are plenty, but at nearly 36 years old his value is shown by cracking the overall top 120.

**119. Enes Kanter (Boston Celtics)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 110)*

Another player who likely would have been top 50 overall in 2008-2009. He is going to have a bigger role for a team expected to win and the results could be positive.

**118. Andrew Wiggins (Minnesota Timberwolves)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 113)*

It's hard to believe he will be turning 25 in February, the talent is there but maybe it's up to him to swing for the fences.

**117. John Wall (Washington Wizards)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 93)*

His recovery at least seems to be going in the right direction. Having only played 73 games since 2017 and now having the worst injury of all (which is especially harmful to a player who relies on his athleticism) has plummeted his value.

**116. Hassan Whiteside (Portland Trail Blazers)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 90)*

The talent is clearly there still. His issue is some games he looks like a legit All-NBA player and others, not even a top 200.

**115. Jeff Teague (Minnesota Timberwolves)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 147)*

The Jeff Teague love surprised me a lot, he appeared on 6 ballots total. With no Derrick Rose to compete with now, if he can stay healthy he is going to get his minutes that is for sure.

**114. Dwight Howard (LA Lakers)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 202)*

Here's where the fun begins! He appeared on 1 list and I was like ""oh"" and then he appeared on a few more and for a second his top 100 aspirations looked legitimate. It would be an incredible comeback and the NBA has seen crazier things happen.

**113. Marcus Morris (New York Knicks)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 100)*

One of the more efficient role players in the entire league last year (and cracked the final spot on the overall top 100) we'll see if M&amp;M can have the same impact in the Big Apple.

**112. Collin Sexton (Cleveland Cavaliers)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 134)*

Similar to Wendell Carter Jr, progression is expected from the sophomore. If that's top 100 level remains to be seen but it's in the realm of possibility.

**111. Joe Harris (Brooklyn Nets)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 102)*

If you had told me the 2nd round pick who was a meme on LeBron's bench would be a fringe top 100 player a few years later I would have laughed, but now one of the best 3 point shooters in the league + played on Team USA these things just happen!

**110. Bam Adebayo (Miami Heat)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 125)*

After 2 years behind Hassan Whiteside, the 22 year old is going to get his chance to shine. Some Shawn Kemp comparisons have been made early and he is a very unique center to say the least.

**109. Rudy Gay (San Antonio Spurs)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 76)*

Gay received a ton of respect in our offseason vote, but the voters predict a decline. Still, he is going to play a big role for the Spurs.

**108. Justise Winslow (Miami Heat)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 95)*

Like Gay, Winslow made the top 100 last year but did not make our preseason prediction list. He was one of my favorite players last year, and a top 100 finish for a 2nd straight year would not surprise me.

**107. Fred VanVleet (Toronto Raptors)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 77)*

There was no single player who raised his ranking more from the playoffs than Fred VanVleet, who likely would have finished around here otherwise. But when your hitting game winning shots in the Finals the fans will take notice. He also finished in my top 100 in 2017-2018 (100th overall) so we'll see if he can make it a 3rd year in a row.

**106. Terry Rozier (Charlotte Hornets)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 139)*

Contract and external factors aside, the voters agree that Rozier will at the very least be better than last year and I'm also a believer that although Charlotte might not be a playoff team, Rozier could surprise some people.

**105. Mitchell Robinson (New York Knicks)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 128)*

The Knicks' found some good luck with this 2nd round pick, and in year 2 at just 21 years old he is already a fringe top 100 player. If he can continue his progression his play could be a scary sight.

**104. Evan Fournier (Orlando Magic)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 107)*

Fournier was an impact player for a playoff team last year, and finished close to a top 100 finish (I personally had him in). He will need to be a little more flashy to get that extra bump he needs to get inside the list.

**103. DeAndre Jordan (Brooklyn Nets)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 96)*

Jordan had an interesting season, with an incredible start for Dallas but by the end was getting healthy DNP's for the Knicks. He's also in a unique situation this year on a team with a long term C (who, spoiler alert, is top 100 on this ranking) so we'll see what his role is.

**102. Kevin Durant (Brooklyn Nets)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 6)*

What do you do here man? There's no exact policy to give for a situation like him. He could miss the whole season (odds are best here right now) but what if he comes back for the playoffs? What if he comes back in April? He's a guaranteed HOF player, should he be ranked even if he doesn't play? The voters spoke. He was ranked top 10 on 3 ballots, 100th on 1 more, but left off the rest.

**101. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (Oklahoma City Thunder)**

*(2018-2019 Ranking: 119)*

So similarly to American Football, what if flag system was introduced in Basketball? Where the head coaches for both the team have an x amount of flags that can be dropped to review or question a call. With the addition of this system, NBA should/could/would remove the review call process.  

  
I feel like this would speed up the game as reviewing the call takes forever and slows down the game significantly. I think this would have the biggest impact on the last 2minutes of the game and furthermore, would allow for more strategy to be involved. Coaches would have to utilize their flags accordingly and would technically add an extra timeout, which can be used very strategically. 

&amp;#x200B;

Without the review process, the calls called on the floor would have to be respected unless it is challenged via flag. This would eliminate the review process almost entirely unless a flag is dropped.

&gt; The argument is that MJ is 6-6 and LBJ is 3-9; which leads to the debate between the difficulty of the opponents they faced. 

&gt; The argument is the LBJ faced tougher opponents in the finals compared to MJ to which the counter argument is that MJ had a more difficult path getting to the Finals even though his Finals opponents don't match to LeBron James. While LeBron had an easier path to the finals. 

&gt; I created a table to see how the teams really ranked using the SRS value. I believe this is good way to compare the strength of the team in that particular NBA season. So how good were the bulls compared to other teams in the 90s and how good were LBJ led teams in the current era? 

**What is SRS?**

&gt; A team rating that takes into account average point differential and strength of schedule. The rating is denominated in points above/below average, where zero is average.

**MJ**

Season  | Bulls | First Round | Second Round | Conference Finals | Finals
---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------
90 - 91 | 8.57 | Knicks -  -0.43| 76ers -  -0.39  |Pistons -  3.08| Lakers-  6.73
91 - 92 | 10.07| Heat -  -3.94| Knicks -  3.67   |Cavs -  5.34 | Blazers -  6.94
**92 - 93** |**6.19** | **Hawks -  -0.67**| **Cavs -  6.30**   |**Knicks -  5.87** | **Suns -  6.27**
95 - 96 | 11.80| Heat - 1.46| Knicks-  2.24 |Magic -  5.40| Sonics -  7.40
97 - 98 | 10.70| Washington - 1.77| Hawks -  5.52|Heat -  5.56| Jazz -  7.97
97 - 98 | 7.24 | Nets - 1.88 | Knicks -  2.27 |Pacers -  6.25 | Jazz -  5.73

&gt; Out of all playoff series when MJ went to the finals and won. There were only two series where the opposing team had a higher SRS rating and the differential is .11

**LBJ**

**LeBron James**

&gt; His path to finals isn't as easy it is made out to be. He did however fail to capitalize against the Mavs? Does this eliminate him from the GOAT talks? Up to you....

**Counter Arguments and Conclusions**

&gt; This isn't to say that MJ strolled to his 6 championships; he faced some really good teams and HOF players at his time but his team was statistically often the best team in the league both offensively and defensively. Could you argue that the reason why it was the best is because of MJ? Is it the evolution of Pippen's game both offensively and defensively? Is it because of Phil Jackson and the incorporation of his offense? That is another post. 

&gt; It also isn't to say that LBJ was always the underdog and was carrying the team all by himself. He did play with other stars and did have the help but the teams he did face were more often then not ranked higher. Could you argue that this is because of the ""LBJ system""? Is it because even though he had star teammates they would often get hurt and couldn't contribute at the right time?

To explore this topic, I am interested in learning examples of times a NBA team was able to overcome poor officiating and win the series in spite of the refs. Such teams are intriguing to me, as they truly played with everything stacked against them.

And here are some interesting tid bits I found looking at the data:

1. Cousy's MVP was the first season any award was awarded, and both sides of the ball seemed terrible. Lowest Off Rtg in the list. Def Rtg is great, probably had a young Bill Russell plus league average FG% was like 35.
2. Bill Russell had the best Def Rtg in a season other than Cousy's, very expected when he's considered the best team player ever and defensive GOAT, especially compared to Wilt.
3. And Wilt had the highest Differential between Off and Def, and the only &gt;100 Off Rtg of the Decade. This was a year he was a very willing passer, I wonder how Off Rtg looks when Wilt was hogging the ball more.
4. Wills Reed, Walt Frazier, and the earlier 70s Knicks need some respect put on their names. Reed was one of only 5 players to be all Defense, a Champ, and an MVP. (Willis, Hakeem, Jordan, Duncan, and Lebron) Highest Rtf Differential until Kareem wins his MVP. Frazier was an all time great guard at the same time.
5. 70s &amp; early 2000s had lowest Off &amp; Def Rtgs. 80s, 90s, late 2000s, and 2010s saw both numbers being much higher. Differentials remained similar, but average ratings across years changed often.
6. 5 Weakest winners by Rtg Dif were Oscar Robertson, Wes Unseld, Bob Petit, Bob McAdoo, and Russell Westbrook. Robertson is the only big surprise to me, but he did win on not stellar Off or Def. Unseld is always seen as a weak pick. The other 3 were just extremely ball dominant. 
7. Shaq and Kobe after Kobe had started peaking, but before Shaq had some injury problems, is the GOAT team by this list to me, I ain't even a Laker fan. To be fair, KD+ Steph Golden Sate and the 2nd 3 Peat Bulls are not here. Shaq belonged in the tier of Wilt, Kareem, Magic, Larry, and MJ, and is support from Kobe was damn near there as well. Very similar personel to the early 70s Knicks (not that Shaq &amp; Willis and Walt &amp; Kobe were the same, just teams anchored by MVP Big men and shadowed by a guard that is still a top 5 player in the league.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,66330,public,self,Made Spreadsheet breaking down each MVPs best MVP season (imo obviously) Info is interesting and it let me make some cool inferences.

&amp;#x200B;

My point is that what teams look for in end-of-rotation players, in general, are clear strenghts and things they can add to the team. They usually are pretty good at certain things (nowadays those things tend to be either perimeter shooting, defense or rebounding), so they can actually help the team a lot in certain games instead of just being a presence on the court to score some points a game and that's it.

&amp;#x200B;

We can see how this helps teams in the playoffs. Last year, Mike Scott had great games shooting from deep and was a tremendous player for a Sixers team that needed shooting, specially because their stars were below-average in that area. That guaranteed him a 2-year contract in the offseason even though he only averaged 8 points in 27 games with Philly. Another guy that performed really well in the playoffs was Kevon Looney, who was brought up in the court everytime the Warriors needed rebounding and a strong presence inside, and the result was a 3-year extension for the big-man.

&amp;#x200B;

To exemplify this, I'll show my favorite team's bench and how this applies:

&amp;#x200B;

Likely Mavericks bench rotation: Seth Curry, Maxi Kleber, Jalen Brunson, Justin Jackson, Dorian Finney-Smith and Boban Marjanovic. You can name each player's specialty, something they are above average at, easily. Seth is a pure sharpshooter and spaces the floor really well. Maxi brings defense and 3-point shooting as well. Jalen Brunson is a good guard with and without the ball, is really smart and can score decently. Jackson is long and has a perimeter shot. DFS is a long defender that can get boards. Boban brings size to the rotation and is a strong presence inside. You can do that with basically any roster.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing with Carmelo is that he doesn't have that thing he's above average at. He's not a great shooter (35% from 3 in 6 attempts in the last 2 seasons while being really inconsistent), isn't athletic anymore, isn't either strong or fast for a foward, can't be efficient posting-up or slashing like he used to... The only area he is good for his position is rebounding, which he has been good at for his whole career. 

&amp;#x200B;

GM's look for role-players that can fit their system or make up for their weaknesses in certain game-situations. Using Dallas as an example again, the Boban signing was basically an assurance that we have a big guy to match-up against tall players that Maxi, Powell or KP can't handle, or have a counter against 2 big rotations like the Lakers. Right now, the only reason a team would give Carmelo a shot is if they needed a foward to secure defensive boards, but how many teams are actually needing or caring about that? He isn't a good enough shooter for us to classify him as a ""sharpshooter"", and he certainly doesn't bring anything else to the table at an above-average rate.

&amp;#x200B;

In certain specific cases, players can get a chance due to their age too. Young guys that aren't that good at anything get chances because they have potential. Vets can fill roster spots to bring a strong locker-room presence to the squad and mentor young lads. But that doesn't seem to be the case with Anthony neither. It looks like he just doesn't have a case anymore.

He played on offensive focused teams so his defense was considered like an acceptable loss or collateral damage by uptempo, volume shooting coaches like Don Nelson and Mike Dantoni. Extra height would have filled the gaps in the defensive game plans and teams would have a tougher time isolating Nash and attacking his height. 

Fundamentally, his defense is not bad. He moved his feet, had the quickness required and stayed in front of his man. Who remembers him contesting every shot?

Anthony Davis and LeBron James are teammates. LeBron James’ running mate is not Kyrie or Wade, it’s Anthony Davis. The monster that can drop an easy 40 and 10 on any given night. Not to mention the monster that LeBron is himself. When he came back from the groin injury he was still dunking on other teams, and dominating on a Lonzo-less defeated Lakers team. The Lakers have now a big group of veterans that can shoot the three ball at a high percentage: Green, Dudley, Cook, and Daniels. You can say that Caruso, KCP, and Rondo are good shooters as well since they shoot above 35%. Kuzma and AD can definitely make improvements this offseason. And we haven’t really seen LeBron slow down just yet. I can make the argument that LeBron didn’t look like he was putting effort during the first half of last season to save energy and prepare himself for the playoffs.

The coincidence is that NBA fans will note how good this team will be and instead make note of other teams like the Nets, Clippers, Nuggets, Rockets, and Bucks. Kevin Durant tore his Achilles’ tendon, Kawhi hasn’t won the championship as a first option against a healthy Finals (not finals, not playoffs) opponent, the Nuggets haven’t made it past the second round, James Harden’s running mate shoots 30% from three, and the Bucks don’t have a serious second option threat on their roster (I would argue Middleton’s impact is that of a third option). 

So I ask you if I requested that you made a prediction about a LeBron/AD led Thunder team with a remaining roster of: Kuzma, Green, Cook, Rondo, Caruso, Howard, KCP, Dudley, and Javale, would you have the same prediction as your current prediction about this upcoming year’s Lakers team? I would argue not because I would also argue that NBA fans have bias for teams that they like such as the Thunder versus teams that they don’t like, such as the Lakers.

This really is an unintuitive fact, that training for ""team sports"" type of fitness, like basketball, soccer, handball, and training for ""bodybuilding"" type of fitness are almost completely different things. It's very strange if you think about it, because someone might look like he is in a great shape and in fact be in really bad ""team sports"" form, and other guy compared to him might look like he never entered the weight room and has excessive fat, and still can be in 5x better ""team sports"" shape.

It might sound like i'm overexaggerating, but i'm really not, the difference can be insane. Training for agility/quickness/explosiveness/endurance has little to none correlation to muscle growth, multiple studies cover those topics. Leg training based on jumping won't make your legs grow (they only might to some point on an untrained individuals), doing 5x5 full ROM squats will. Explosive push variations like kettlebells/medicine balls (""push press"" type of movement) we see used very often in bball players training won't make your upper body grow, doing 4x8 military press with progressive overload will.

I will use an example that bothers me the most - it blows my mind how many people here judge James Harden as if he wasn't in shape, and that he just need to eat less and that will make him improve. The truth is: his strength, agility, quickness, endurance is absolutely out of this world, top of the top level, despite him being ~240lbs (yes, if he really is 6'5 i'm 100% sure he weights that) and not in an ideal bf% level. The question is, could he lose those ~10lbs of fat to go from 13-16% to 9-12% range? If he was training only bodybuilding for 2 month, he could eaisly, but that would make his basketball skills decrease hugely, and also what is weird - his agility, quickness could slighly decrease too, despite losing fat while maintaining muscle mass. So like he does, to be a great basketball player he must spend ~3 hours a day basketball drills. And now - if we added bodybuilding stuff to that while being on a caloric deficit, problems with recovery would appear. What If we don't add bodybuilding stuff while still being on a caloric deficit? His muscle:fat ratio of his weight loss would be quite bad (for a top level athlete), because he didnt do bodybuilding type of training while being already on a relatively low bf% level and most likely not worth at all.

TL;DR - 1. physiques of team sports players can be weirdly unimpressive, despite them being amazing athletes, compared to some amateur bodybuilders with ~2 years of doping-free bodybuilding training history. 
2. it's not easy to change a player's physique while mantaining his skill level, in most cases, it is not worth at all. probably only extreme cases, like embiid, jokic, now zion, would make it be worth it, and trainers know it for sure but player's work ethic is the problem

The narrative on Rosen hasnt been that hes a bad quarterback... but that the teams he has been apart of so far (Arizona and Miami) have not put effort into improving the team around him, nor have they put effort into building a future around him.

**Starting with Ingram.**

He really started to play well towards the end of the season last year until the blood clot. From December 21st to March 2nd he averaged around 20 ppg 5 rebounds 3 assists on 51% from the field and 33% from 3. While the 3 point percentage has increased you can see the significant growth that he had. Im curious to know what kind of numbers he would have if he didnt have the injury.

The move to the Pelicans is a big one for him as he'll be the second best player and 1A 1B option on offense along with Jrue Holiday. I expect him to struggle in the beginning of the season due to rust and adjusting to the new team. But overall i can see him ending the season averaging around 20 ppg. This is a big year and a contract year for him as he'll be an RFA after next season.

**Next is Dennis Smith Jr**

Dennis Smith Jr has the tools to be a dynamic offensive guard in the league. His rookie year, while inconsistent, showed promise on the offensive end. His second year was a bit rougher with the arrival of Luka and the trade to NY.

This year he'll (most likely) be the starting Point Guard and will be a main focus of the Knicks main core. The Knicks improved their team considerably compared to what they had last year. Last year was a bunch of back ups and 3rd string players getting minutes. Now they have have some legit nba players like Randle, Ellington, Morris, Portis, and Gibson to help the younger guys develop on the court. With that being said, i see DSJ's ppg average going up from 13 from last year to about 16-17 this year. I predict he will still be inconsistent, but more consist than his first 2 years. Hes one of those players who is a jumpshot away from being very very solid. And according to his trainer he's been working with Chris Paul this summer as well as working on fixing some mechanics in his jumpshot. We'll see if any of that work pays off. 

**Finally, Donovan Mitchell**

Mitchell is going to benefit the most from his teams acquisitions i feel. He's was been a good defender in college but i feel because he always has to carry such a huge offensive load that he can't commit as much on defense as he can. With the addition of Mike Conley and Bojan, that offensive load will be well distributed. 

His biggest issue was efficiently as he shot well from 3 (36%) but only 43% from the field. While its not terrible, it can definetly be improved. We also saw some struggle in the playoffs, but again, how much can a 2nd year player do as the sole dynamic offensive option. I expect to see him average around 25 ppg this year with an increase of assists and better production on the defense end. I think the addition of Conley is huge for Mitchell and he will benefit greatly with the acquired offensive assets.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,66167,public,self,"What kind of year do you think Brandon Ingram, Dennis Smith Jr, and Donovan Mitchell will have next year?",0,1569076459,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/d6vsdq/what_kind_of_year_do_you_think_brandon_ingram/,,,,,,,,,,,,

**Top Ten**

&gt; I'm not saying Kobe is at the top of the ladder but I feel many would include him in the top 10 list or at the very least top 15. 

&gt; I think comparing players that played during the MJ, Kobe, LeBron era with the old timers is pretty hard and there is always going to be arguments about the play style, rules, league parity and so forth so including the likes of Wilt, Kareem, Bill Russell in this modern GOAT debate skews the conversation.

&gt; So at point in his career did LeBron overtake Shaq and Kobe or (Magic and Bird if you want to talk about them too) 

**Second Title with the Heat**

&gt; I personally think this is the point when LeBron held the league by the balls. Heat were so dominant and they went on that 27 game winning streak. He was just a monster on both sides of the floor. 

&gt; His final season averages were 26.8 points, 8 rebounds, 7.3 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 56.5 percent shooting.

&gt; In the post season he carried the team with several of his teammates struggled but took them to the Finals to face the Spurs

&gt; In Game 7, he tied the Finals record for most points scored in a Game 7 victory, leading Miami over San Antonio with 37 points. He was named Finals MVP for the second straight season, averaging 25.3 points, 10.9 rebounds, 7 assists, and 2.3 steals per game for the championship round.

**Beating the GSW**

&gt; I think after this title he cemented himself in the GOAT conversation. That series was so surreal to watch.

The clipper now have wings in kawhi and george who have a great size advantage over their defensive matchups plus are great post players as well.

Furthermore, the team is also built with players who can spot up and cut in pretty effectively when you look at Patrick Beverly, Landry Shamet and not to mention both Paul and kawhi can also fill in these roles seamlessly.

Give it a look if you're interested.


The National Football League season is heating up, but still boring, so let's talk basketball! After an absolutely bananas National Basketball Association offseason which saw nine of the top 20 players and approximately 15 of the top 40 players in the league change teams, there is no more absolute favorite in the league.  The Golden State Warriors lost Kevin Durant to the New York Nets and Klay Thompson to an ACL tear, but they added young stud D’Angelo Russell. The Houston Rockets traded Chris Paul for former MVP Russell Westbrook to give James Harden someone else to relegate ball handling duties to. The Los Angeles Clippers turned their core players of Shai Gilgous-Alexander and every future pick they own for 10 years into Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. The Los Angeles Lakers traded their young core away for Anthony Davis, then added Boogie Cousins who promptly tore his ACL, and the team is drowning in off court drama.  The Milwakee Bucks did absolutely nothing. The Philadelphia 76ers brought back Tobias Harris and signed Al Horford — Joel Embiid’s kryptonite. The Miami Heat somehow signed Jimmy Butler. The Boston Celtics lost everyone and signed Kemba Walker and Enes Kanter. Meanwhile, the Brooklyn Nets retooled and traded D’Angelo Russell, Allen Crabbe and some picks to create the space to sign Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, DeAndre Jordan and Taureen Prince. This is an unprecedented level of parity in the NBA right now. So the biggest question for me isn’t who’s the best, but who has the most pressure not to lose? The Golden State Warriors:  After five straight years of making the finals, and winning three times, this might be the first time in about four years that the Warriors are not predicted to go to the finals, which makes me think they’re even more likely to go to the finals. But if they aren’t able to, it’s not a big deal. Their core is locked up all together for years and Draymond, Curry and Klay will probably all retire as Warriors D’Angelo Russell can either take the torch from them or be traded for someone on their timeline, and this team will have opportunities to contend for many more years to come. PRESSURE RATING: light pressure.


 The Utah Jazz:  The Jazz might have the best core in NBA history of players who have never made an all-star game with Mike Conley, Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert. They traded a few average assets to get Mike Conley, and are located in Utah so they don’t really have any expectations except maybe to make the second round with the bloodbath that is the West. PRESSURE RATING - Meh.


 The Celtics: The Celtics lost their two best players, added a worse player and a center whose defense is suspect at best. But they are located in Boston, so therefore Jason Tatum and Jaylen Brown are “All-stars” and anything less than the finals is a bust. PRESSURE RATING: complicated.
 The Portland Trailblazers and Denver Nuggets: I’m putting these two together because they’re in the same boat. Both have one super star player (Jokic, Dame), a costar whose true value is hard to quantify and fit isn’t perfect (Murray, McCollum) and a third star whose value changes astronomically from season to season (Harris, Nurkic). Both teams are looked at in the lower tier of Western playoff teams despite having great regular seasons last year, and both have a lot of pressure to prove their team is good enough to compete or their team might get blown up. PRESSURE RATING: mounting.


 The Los Angeles Clippers: They traded every real trade asset they have for Paul George and in turn signing Kawhi Leonard. By doing this series of trades and signings they have committed to Paul George and Kawhi Leonard for eight seasons each, meaning they will have both Paul George and Kawhi Leonard on max contracts until they are 37 and 36, respectively. They have no money to add a third star within the next few years and they still have a massive hole at their starting center position. The expectations for the Clippers are sky high with both Kawhi and George abandoning their old title contending team for a new one. PRESSURE RATING: high mountains. 


 The Los Angeles Lakers: Much like the Clippers, the Lakers traded their young core and a good slew of picks for a superstar, Anthony Davis. The Lakers have a very interesting roster, but the fit of everyone is very questionable, the bill of health for everyone is questionable and the coaches they have hired are questionable. But it’s LA with two, superstars so you'd better believe the pressure is high, the effects that a disappointing season would have on both LeBron and Davis’ legacy would be huge. PRESSURE RATING: submarine. 
 The Brooklyn Nets: Kevin Durant is out for the season, so the Nets have no pressure except to be a high seed and win one playoff series. PRESSURE RATING: atmospheric pressure.


 The Philadelphia 76ers: The process has been incredibly disappointing, With many missed draft picks and wasted or mismanaged assets, the peak that has been reached by the 76ers has been a rule-change because of them and second round exits. If the Ben Simmons Joel Embiid experiment doesn’t start winning playoff series, we could easily see one of them shipped off for someone who fits better and can actually shoot the ball. PRESSURE RATING: that Queen song.


 The Houston Rockets: Four first round picks from 2021 to 2026 were traded for Russell Westbrook. The core outside of Harden, Westbrook and Capela is old as dirt. If the Rockets can’t win it now even the owners says “we won’t win in next 10 years”. PRESSURE RATING: Marianas Trench.


 The Milwaukee Bucks: The Bucks added Robin Lopez, overpaid Middleton and lost Malcolm Brogden this offseason, and that’s pretty much all they did. Ian Giannis, has two years left on his contract going into this year, his “pre-agency” has begun, and if the Bucks can’t get to the finals this year, the Bucks star might seek the greener pastures of Toronto, LA, or anywhere that shows him they’re committed to winning titles. PRESSURE RATING: Florida in 2050.

**Why WB should be a primary ball handler/PG and Harden should be take the SG role** 

&gt; The primary reason for this is simple: Harden is a much better shooter and can space the floor significantly better then WB. WB is just as good of a passer as Harden so this would allow WB to drive and kick it out to open shooter. **Keep in mind; Rocket's Shooting &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; OKC's Shooting.** This will make it easier for WB to finish with the paint being no where as crowded. 

&gt; Russ plays at a different tempo compared to Harden and the Rockets. He pushes the ball much faster and makes the offense more dynamic. Instead of Harden having the ball and calling for a PnR/ISO; you will now have WB leading a fast-break. 

&gt; Harden would still get crunch time shots and will get his touches to slow down the pace to break down difficult defenses/exploit easier match ups. 

&gt; Harden would have to expend only a fraction of energy he would otherwise.

**Why WB should adapt his style to become better a better off the ball player**

&gt; Highly doubt the Rockets would try to having WB be an off the ball player. This has never been his style and while they might experiment with this I doubt he would be able to adapt his game in a season. 

&gt; Harden is one of most efficient offensive players so why should he give up his touches for a less efficient PG? He is basically a better on the ball player.

&gt; This notion that WB is a horrible off the ball player is exaggerated. In his OKC days he was cutting/finishing at the rim; with his explosive and quick play keeping up with him would be a nightmare. 

**Conclusion**

&gt; Adding WB makes the Rockets so much dynamic. He makes them deadly in transition, can penetrate the paint really well and surrounding him with shooters is only going to make the defenses harder to contain. 

&gt; The Rockets can stagger the minutes so one of the two stars are always dictating the offense and they have the flexibility of having both of them on the floor.

Western conference

1- Denver 62-20 (Running it back with some Sid additions makes them my pick for top spot in the west)

2- Clippers 58-24 (edging clippers over Lakers due to 1. Bench depth, 2. Clippers fan bias :) )

3- Lakers 55-27 (I expect a bit of an adjustment period for them, but expect a deep playoff run)

4- Jazz 55-27 (if jazz can start out strong, unlike previous seasons I'd place them higher)

5- Rockets 54-28 (Honestly don't know what to expect with Harden and W/Brook)

6- Warriors 50-32 (Steph will still be Steph, I expect atleast 2nd round playoffs)

7- Blazers 48-34 (I'm not sure how well Whiteside will fit in the blazers system)

8- Mavs 46-36 (this all depends on how great Luca's sophomore year is)

9- Spurs 46-36 (giving Mavs the edge, due to Aldridge's age)

Eastern Conference

1- Bucks 63-19 (I expect Giannis to continue to provide MVP calibre performances day in and day out, plus a better jump shot. Losing Brogdan would have hurt though)

2- 76ers 57-25 (Weaker east, plus picking up Horford, plus the possibility Ben atleast has a respectable jumpshot)

3- Pacers 52-30 (Oladipo + Brogdan should be a formidable duo)

4- Celtics 51-31 (If Kemba can't lead them out of the east, no one can)

5- Heat 49- 33 (Jimmy should flourish having youngsters to abuse)

6- Nets 46-36 (Kyrie is good enough to lead them to the playoffs, but not past the second round)

7- Raptors 45-37 (Losing Kawhi hurt, but they are still a good team without him)

8- Magic 41-41 (Nice pick up in Aminu, however they will struggle against the top 5 in the east)

Let me be clear what I mean by that. They have one of the most talented groups of players in the league. Lonzo Ball, Jrue Holiday, Brandon Ingram, Zion Williamson, Derrick Favors, JJ Redick, Jaxson Hayes, Josh Hart... If you look at that roster, you can argue that they one of the better rosters in the league.

There is one problem though. Fit. When teams are trying to develop a young player, they need to give that player the roster to help grow the player into an MVP. The Phoenix Suns had a tough roster of Devin Booker, Josh Jackson, Trevor Ariza, Ryan Anderson, Deandre Ayton, Dragan Bender, and Mikal Bridges last season. Looks great on paper, yet they had one of the worst records in the league, and Devin Booker's stock hadn't risen at all in the NBA. Josh Jackson turned into a bust  and Deandre Ayton was just a meh player according to the NBA. the 2017 Wolves are another example. They had young and promising players that couldn't grow because there was so much young talent on the roster. Kris Dunn, Zach Lavine, Andrew Wiggins,  Nmenja Bjelica, Karl Anthony-Towns, Tyus Jones; that was a mean roster. 

KAT is still dominating because of how good he is, however I believe if he was put into a situation like the Trae Young, Stephen Curry, and Derrick Rose; where teams aren't juggling young players like trying to win the lottery by buying more tickets all at once, I think he could be one of the front runner for MVP next season. I have this same argument against the Sixers, Celtics, Bulls, Cavs, and Mavericks. The story is going to be; who is going to lead this team? Simmons or Embiid? Brown or Tatum? Lavine or Markannen? Garland or Sexton? Doncic or Porzingis? Then the young players on those teams are going to try to play team basketball to make sure they aren't hurting the team and eventually become underdeveloped.

Early results have come in and I will say are very surprising yet effective. This certainly isn't going to be a list with cookie cutter results.

To be clear again, this is your prediction for what the top 100 players will be AT THE END of the season and not what they are right now.

###Why the Wizard's should trade him

&gt; In a vacuum, Beal is a great player to build your team around but the Wall contract hurts the chances of the Wizards contending. It is arguably one of the worst contracts and makes it very tough if not impossible to put the right pieces around Beal

&gt; Beal is most likely to leave once his contract is up so it's in their best interest to trade him while he is still on the books and look towards getting assets

&gt; It's in their best interest to trade Beal next off-season when FA is dry. Draymond already resigned. AD most likely will resign with the Lakers.

&gt; Why would they do it? A third star in Beal would most certainly mean they are the favorites. He isn't injury prone, can set up teammates, spread the floor, holds his own on defense, and get a shot for himself

&gt; Why wouldn't they? They would be gutting their depth/roster. They would have give up one of Harkless/Beverly (doubt they would do Beverly like that). They'd have to likely give up Shamet as he is a young and shows ton of promise and is on a great contract.

Worked for D'Angelo Russell in Brooklyn jersey (even made an all star team in just one season removed from being a Laker) as he was traded there with such low value that he was added as a chip in Mozgov salary dump trade. Julius Randle took another huge leap in production in his season with Pelicans passing 20ppg mark and adding solid three point shot to his repertoar, Zubac had more than decent end of the season with Clippers and we're also waiting for his first full season for Clippers (though he never got a real chance in Lakers jersey and when he got those chances played really well). In some manner it can be applied to Thomas Bryant who playing for Wizards proved he can be a serviceable and efficient big man in 20mpg played there posting decent stats and more importantly was high energy guy with great rim running and solid rim protecting abilities. If we want to stretch the theory it can include Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance had their best seasons last year (although in pretty weak Cavs team) So basically even it's completely normal for young players to develop with more minutes all of these players showed progress across the board.

So, Ingram and Ball had some injury issues and in some moments showed that they can develop into very good players. Ingram showed progress in each of his seasons and although he shot worse from three point range his overall FG improved and maybe this can be the season that he'll break the 20ppg barrier if he stays healthy and gets his  three point shot at least on league average. Ball even as young player played good defense in both his seasons as a Laker but to be a pro basketball player (even more so guard) and shoot 40% from foul line is inexcusable. Also him missing almost half the games across two seasons played isn't a good look for him. As he has a glaring weakness in his game fixing that even to an acceptable percentages would mean him taking a big leap in productivity. And lastly Josh Hart took a step back in efficiency last years while posting roughly the same numbers in all statistical categories. He came into the league as a collage senior so his sealing might not be as high as for other players here but as in his rookie season he shot 40% from three point range he can be an useful player in today's NBA where floor spacing in a must have asset.

And almost all their arguments revolve around the scoring records he set and how those compare to Kobe and Jordan or how Harden lifted the team from 14th to 4th seed (Which is irrelevant because they were the 14th seed due to Harden in the first place, and that is part of the season as well).

But none of these biased Harden supporters will mention Giannis and his achievements. The MVP is not judged in a vacuum. Comparing Harden's scoring and offense to Jordan and Kobe doesn't mean he deserves MVP.

**Let's start with Harden.** I am not going to mention his records but you can easily look them up if you wish. Just to be clear, having that level of scoring is very valuable. I am not suggesting that Harden wasn't insanely good and valuable. Harden scored 9 more pp100 than Giannis and at the top end, that is a very very sizable gap. Harden is also the better playmaker than Giannis, even though the gap was small this year. And Harden was also a better 3pt shooter than Giannis, but that's not saying much. So rather, I'd say Harden was comparable or better in his shooting to guys like Lillard and PG13, which does say a lot. To put it in even better perspective, **Harden was the best off the dribble/pull-up 3pt shooter among guys not named Steph Curry.** Offensively, Harden was the greatest since...... 2017-18 Harden or 2015-16 Curry, still easily better than Giannis. *Also per 100 possessions, Rockets were +1.1 without Harden and +6.2 with him.*

But, MVP considers your opponents as well. In this case, that was Giannis. And MVP isn't the scoring title or best Offensive player title, so just being the best scorer isn't enough when the competition is tough.

**Giannis had an awesome year.** His stats were great, just like Harden. Giannis was an insanely good rebounder, which is often overlooked. Harden is obviously destroyed in this category. Giannis' scoring was great and uber-efficient (We are talking Steph Curry levels of efficiency+volume combo) even though he played fewer minutes due to many blowouts. He was the best playmaker on his team and had some of the best passing from his position. He was overall more efficient than Harden (and significantly more efficient from the field (eFG% ignores free throws)). *Also* p*er 100 possessions, the Bucks were +4.3 without Giannis and +12.4 with Giannis.*

All this and we haven't even gotten to his defense and team stuff.

I'm not going to use the cheap argument that Giannis had the 1st seed, even though that does matter IRL. The gap was small and West was harder IMO. But **Giannis was a DPOY candidate**, and only lost because Stifle Tower exists. The Bucks had the best defense in the league, due to Giannis. The Bucks were a top 5 offense due to Giannis. Those are simultaneous. He led his team to a top defense AND a top offense as well at the same time. Harden didn't. Add this to the 1st seed, and you can see Giannis' insane value.

Honestly, Giannis winning it shows that they considered defense as well, which is a huge deal. Just offensively, Harden wins it easily. But add defense to the mix, and Giannis' true value shows. He defense was a big deal, but conveniently ignored by Harden fans when they argue Harden was MVP.

If you think Harden deserved MVP, please don't ignore Giannis when making your case. That completely invalidates your argument because MVP is judged based on competition, not just 1 player's offensive prowess.

And since Rockets' fans like the Harden-MJ scoring comparison, Here is a comparison of Giannis' 2019-19 season to 1993-94 Hakeem that Rockets fans can understand. One could even argue Giannis is more valuable (More pp100, double ap100, more rp100, Much higher efficiency, higher VORP in fewer minutes, Much higher WS/48 and so on) but I am not saying that.

Do the MJ-Harden comparison if it pleases you, but don't forget that Giannis' had a season statistically better than Hakeem's best year while Giannis is also somewhat close to Hakeem on defense while Harden doesn't even sniff MJ's shoes when it comes to defense.

I thought it was pretty lame that he joined the team that had beaten him just 2 months prior and I agree that it made the NBA predictable. But that's just it; it was Durant's decision. 

Now everyone likes to look at the past through rose-tinted glasses, in which this case I'm talking about OKC. Many say that he had a perfect situation in Oklahoma and that Durant was the problem for always underperforming in the postseason. 

But let's just talk about those Thunder teams. A lot of people talk about them as if they were in place to be the next dynasty. In truth, they weren't very good and what they struggled with most was spacing and depth. 

In almost every postseason, the team had to be put on Durant and Westbrook's shoulders, almost every possession was an isolation by those two. And any competent shooter they did have ultimately forgot how to shoot. 

And due to Westbrook's poor jumpshot, all the defense needed to do was focus on Durant, constantly forcing him into double-teams, zones, traps, or just playing him physically. 

And their depth was such a problem it seemed as if every off-season they took a swing at every possible scoring option. The issue with scoring, spacing, and depth was so dire even Serge Ibaka began shooting jumpshots to open up the floor. 

So was Durant really wrong when he just it was him and Westbrook? A little bit but there's some truth to it and you could that it was a glaring problem. 

While I'm at it, let's just shed some light on the whole 'Durant joined a 73-9 Warriors team' comment. Golden State had literally sacrificed all of their depth and some of their starting 5 to even sign Durant. 

The players who remained from that '15-16 season were Curry, Green, Iguodala, and Thompson. And the last I checked 4 players don't win you a championship, a prime example of this is the 2011 Heat. 

Durant didn't even join the same Warriors team, all of this said, it still wasn't cool in my opinion but at the end of the day it was Durant's choice. 

Regardless, Durant's championships were long overdue and he definitely deserves those. They may not mean as much to some, but he was spectacular in those finals.

Kawhi beat a Klay-less and Durant-less Warriors team. In almost 40 years around 90% of teams that won a championship have had a player that won MVP either the season in which the player won the title or seasons before. MVP players have leadership quality skills and there is a reason why players like Kawhi, Griffin, Paul, Anthony, George, and Lillard have not won MVP yet. MVP players are players that have a(n) passing game, good team, leadership qualities, and vocal abilities. MVPs' games are  on another level and earning the trophy itself proves it so.

Here is a link to past teams that won an NBA championship. Note that only the 89', 90', 04' Pistons and the 2019 Raptors are the only 4 teams to win a championship without an MVP since 1980. Losing teams featured rosters built around players like Dwight Howard, a young Kevin Durant, Jason Kidd, Reggie Miller, and other MVP-less players. I find the teams that had it easiest had a solid and clear third option player on the roster and teams that lost didn't have solid second and third options on the roster.

I'm not counting out teams in the NBA this year. I am just spreading an opinion that I think this pattern of NBA history shouldn't be taken lightly. If I were to put bias on a team in the NBA finals, I'm not taking an MVP-less team against a healthy team with an MVP. Even if the teams without an MVP are as good as the 2012 Thunder, 2005 Pistons, 2000 Pacers etc.

Taking a look at the NBA as it currently stands, teams with an MVP in the NBA currently are the Lakers, Rockets, Warriors, and Bucks. Giannis doesn't even have much of a second option on the team (Khris Middleton), and though the Warriors have D'Angelo Russell, Klay Thompson is hurt. Not only that though but making the second and third option the SG and SF on a team built around a PG seems extremely illogical to me. Curry and Russell don't stand up well against LeBron and Davis or Harden and Westbrook so though they are a very dangerous team, I am counting them out. I am going to go in on a unsurprising hypothesis that the 2020 champions (assuming the team with an MVP is healthy) will either be the Lakers, Rockets, or a team with a new first-time MVP on their roster.

Every person played a significant part and nobody can take that away from them. All of that said, let's begin:

Teammates: Anytime Duncan's name is mentioned, odds are Ginobili &amp; Parker's will be too. You'd think that they were transcendent talents by the way people speak of them but no, they were not. Ginobili was a crafty 6th man/role player who was good for a nightly 16-4-3 and Parker was a top 10 PG for his peak. But if you think that those 2 guys make or break Duncan's career you're either misinformed or mistaken. 

People have Duncan as low as not even top 10 on their all-time lists because he had ""too much"" help. Now his teams were good, but if you think Parker &amp; Ginobili are enough to hold Duncan back yet you have Magic Johnson, KAJ, etc. ahead of him then you're just being a hypocrite. 

And as for Robinson &amp; Leonard, well, Robinson's downfall literally put the Spurs in position to draft Duncan. He struggled mightily with back &amp; foot problems too. And as someone who watched the 2010's Spurs, I can tell you that Kawhi Leonard hadn't become a true star in this league until 2015-16. Which was Duncan's last season. 

So try to refrain from using this argument by saying that he played with ""HOF'ers"" when in reality Robinson and Leonard weren't at their peak and TP/Ginobili only made it because of their resumè via the Spurs.

Side note, where was this great help in the late 90's and early '00's? Duncan on multiple occasions willed the Spurs to victory. Especially with his 2003 playoffs run where he legitimately didn't have a consistent 2nd option. 

Coaching: Gregg Popovich is the GOAT coach in my opinion. His name, too, is synonymous with Duncan's. But here's a fun fact for a lot of younger people that didn't watch the Spurs from 1998-2006: the Spurs system wasn't what it was today. 

Let me just explain that system for you: Give Duncan the ball down low and stay stagnant until Duncan can give you an easy feed. That's it. The whole 14-men deep, constant ball-movement shtick hadn't become a thing until 2007 when Duncan was beginning to decline. 

The 2008-2016 Spurs was made because of the fact that Duncan's knee and age had caught up to him. Before that, it was literally just give Duncan the ball and move only if he can feed you the basket.

Basically, I'm saying the Spurs at their peak lived and died with Duncan. His teammates and team overall was great, but they were either role players or they simply weren't at their peak with him. 

The Spurs ""system"" was Duncan, Duncan, &amp; more Duncan for about 10 years until Parker begin to prove himself more and more while Ginobili finally proved to be consistent.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,65742,public,self,People tend to overrate Duncan's situation in SA,0,1568538791,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/d42xz8/people_tend_to_overrate_duncans_situation_in_sa/,,,,,,,,,,,,

And some playoff disappointments &amp; MVP awards later we look back at what could've been. 

I truly believe that Durant, Harden, and Westbrook all become as good as they do today even if they stay together. Harden had averaged 17-4-4 on a much smaller role with less touches. Yes, he did this against other reserves but you could see the talent was there.

If the team sacrificed their depth and were built solely around those 3, I think they could've succeeded. They would also need to play very fast and would need to move the ball frequently. 

As for their statistical peak together, I think Durant's peak would be his 2012-13 season while Harden and Westbrook's peak being their 2015-16 season. 

Other teams that were built like this were the 1985 Nuggets and the 1991 Warriors. And surely enough, they played fast and hard. Though I think this hypothetical OKC team would be far better defensively, especially Westbrook. 

Basically, for this team to be successful it would need to be built solely around those 3 players. Meaning there'd be virtually no depth and they'd be playing at a high pace annually. 

This would be an ideal world though and not what would've happened exactly. For all I know, maybe Harden just stays a great bench player and Westbrook is just the flashy sidekick.

&gt; The Senate gave final approval to Senate Bill 206 by Sen. Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley) in a 39-0 vote. The Assembly passed the bill 73-0 on Monday.

&gt; NCAA has forcefully pushed back against the bill, saying it has the potential to kill amateur athletics if it becomes law. 

&gt; The bill would not allow schools to directly pay athletes, but would permit students to receive compensation from outside sources — for example, from a video game company or for signing autographs or memorabilia.

###Things to consider###

**The bill still has to become a law before it's enforced.**

**NCAA argues there is no distinction between professional and amateur college athletes; and gives certain schools unfair advantage**

**This would set a huge precedent for the other states to follow. Yet to see what the NCAA would do as this is a major blow for them. They could try to make the students ineligible or make the school ineligible (not sure if this is actually a possibility something I picked up from the article)

They'll still show up for the olympics, because, hey, every young athlete has at least a secret dream of an Olympic gold medal. Yet, the big names just refuse to turn up for the FIBA world cup. 

Not only is it incredibly embarrassing that a nation of such basketball talent like the US didn't even medal, but it is also incredibly dangerous. Team USA easily could have slipped further and ended up having to do a play in tournament right as the NBA Playoffs start just to qualify for the Olympics. You want to talk about the worst case scenario? There you go, scrambling a team together of guys who missed the playoffs like 5 days before a tournament begins so we can make the Olympics, yikes. 

My proposal is pretty simple. Give guys who play on the FIBA world cup team right of first refusal to be on the Olympic team. That way if a guy wants to play in the Olympics, then he knows the only way to ensure that is to play in the FIBA World cup. This will also increase continuity of the team from FIBA to the world cup, reducing the chance of a major upset on an even larger stage.

The United States team had glaring weakness from the start with lack of cohesion in team construction along with superior talent pulling out, but the game against France was an exhibition of Team USA's flaws as a whole. Mediocre play from bigs forced the US to go small against Gobert which killed them on both ends of the floor, and the amount of players who prefer to rely on themselves to create their own shots in Tatum, Walker, Mitchell, Middleton and Brown along with simplistic sets made the offense stale and predictable.

Ironically this lead to some of the best team defense of the tournament with the United States having to rally on halfcourt defensive execution for much of their play which certainly showed today, and their sheer athleticism and ability to get ahead in transition were their biggest gifts. 

The defeat against France was a mixture of many things going perfectly wrong for team USA, with both their stars butting heads and their role players not playing into their roles when needed. Lopez and Harris are both players who can be plugged into modern offenses relatively smoothly but both struggled to find a rhythm, especially in the case of Lopez who is prone to being pigeonholed into being solely a spot up shooter. His ability to stretch the floor could've done wonders against Gobert, but he was frozen and Turner was in foul trouble. Still, with his track record of playing Gobert well he might've done a better job on defense on denying Gobert inside.

For many the league was their only way out, the best way to feed their family's, and a platform they're still grateful for today. Things have changed over the last decade or so with many coming from better environments, attending the best camps/schools and being highly recruited from an early age, some even getting some cash under the table if you know what I mean (it's rare but we all know it happens to top tier players). So the urgency to get to the league might still be there but being the best and trying to win championships seems like an afterthought for most players. Maybe the guaranteed contracts have demotivated players, after all average players making 8 figures a year doesn't give much incentives to win. You could theoretically just scrape through collecting checks which many do. A few guys doing it won't ruin the league but it's absurdly high in today's NBA.

I'm not saying many just sit around and don't work hard. Conditioning is important and staying on top of your game is important, some of these guys really love the sport. But there's a difference between trying to be the best basketball player and trying to be the best basketball player who is eager to compete and win. Taking on challenges, hustling on both ends of the floor, holding yourself and teamates accountable. It seems like the NBA culture isn't eager to win. Parity has always been an issue, but you can only blame the coaching staff and FO so much. How many players can you actually say take initiative to win in today's NBA? I can see why someone with this kinda mentality be frustrated with his team, who whats to play with guys who aren't hungry to win?

All of these teams are probably going to make the playoffs in some order, but who could you see as most likely to miss the playoffs?

In my list, I'm going from most likely to make the playoffs to least likely to make the playoffs.

For instance, I don't see the Lakers finishing third in the West, but feel they have the third best chance to make the playoffs, even if it is as the 7th or even 8th seed. 

1. Nuggets
2. Blazers
3. Lakers
4. Clippers
5. Warriors
6. Jazz
7. Rockets

I put the Rockets last as I feel they have a lot of risk with their current team. They traded away a lot for Russ, but it may blow up quick. Harden has been stretched the last two years and could be due an injury (not hoping for one, just miles on his body). Not a lot of other improvements. Jazz made big moves but are a bit of a mystery and don't have the star power to contend with those I've ranked higher. Warriors have been obviously depleted, who knows how they respond, but I think well. Just not sure how that roster works together. I put the Lakers above the Clippers as I think George will struggle to come back from two surgically repaired shoulders. Kawhi will be load managed for the rest of his career.

There are 7 teams that I think would feel like their season is a huge disappointment if they don't make the second round. The Lakers, Clippers, Rockets, Warriors, Nuggets, Jazz, Blazers. Only 4 of these teams can make the second round which means at least 3 of them will have disappointing seasons. I don't think It makes sense to try and predict which teams will make the second round now because that will depend on who they match up against in the first round. So my question is who do you think will take the last playoff spot in the West.

1. Spurs
2. Pelicans
3. Timberwolves
4. Mavs
5. Kings
6. Thunder
7. Suns
8. Grizzlies

That is my order from most likely to least likely to  make the 8th seed.

I put the Spurs first mostly because they made it last year and the year before that and the year before that....

Pelicans I can see being a bottom 3 team in the west but their potential is really high. So many young players but they all can play. Also their defense at guard is so good I could even see them putting up a good fight if they somehow manage to play Portland in the first round.

Towns is the best player not on those other 7 teams but I think its likely that they are fighting for the 8th spot and don't get it AGAIN...

Mavs have Porzingis and Luca. other then that they are a bit limited Hardaway can score and Powell is solid but overall the team is not so good in my opinion. Also if Porzingis stands at the three point line all day like he did in New York then they only have 1 star player in Luca.

I expect some people to get mad at me for putting the Kings so low. I just think they over preformed to star last season. I don't expect that to happen again. We know Fox and Hield are good but I'm not sure either are all-stars next year. Will Bagley take a big step in his second season? They would need everything to go right to make the Playoffs.

The last 3 teams I don't really think have much of a chance. Even if Paul stays healthy this is a team that seems to be in tanking mode after trading away their 2 best players in the off season.

The Suns were trash last year. Booker and Ayton can play but they can't seem to win. Adding Rubio will not be enough to make a playoff push

Grizzlies no comment needed.

They did lose some depth on guard spots with Curry and Turner leaving but apparently Simmons is ready for some sort of breakout season (anyway lot of people hold high opinion on him) Another huge issue is  Nurkic injury and ability to implement Whiteside into their game style (but if they could reach WCF with Kanter anything is possible. It can also give us some more meaningful minutes to Zach Collins who has the potential to become very good as solid rim runner and rim protector while also giving some spacing from the 5 spot.  Bazemore is nice addition as he provides some much needed scoring outside Dame and CJ. Another big subtraction for them is Aminu but as they signed Tolliver who offers them more spacing from the 4 spot that can even turn out to be an upgrade in their system. Nassir Little is potential steal of the draft as he can easily become much better than his draft position is saying. 

Finally they managed to resign Hood on a pretty team friendly contract and not so long ago before being traded to the Cavs he was 17ppg and almost 40% from 3 for the Jazz while playing under 30 [minutes. In](https://minutes.In) the PO for the Blazers he showed glimpses of that potential and if he can fully return to that form he can be that of the bench kick for them. 

From the beginning of the summer they were mentioned in all sorts of trade rumors involving Kevin Love whose trade stock is at all time low and if they can get him near the trade deadline for the package of expiring contract /Whiteside combined with some younger talent and some picks they would have really good starting five of Dame, CJ, Bazemore, Love and Nurkic... Plus as they are pretty deep in the rotation they would still have some talent there and seriously challenge every team out there. 

In final this team came from everybody talking about the blowing it up and starting a rebuild to going to WCF next season and now in stacked West. Now they are in pretty good situation and can patiently look for that final piece of the puzzle while having all of their best players locked up long term. In my prediction they will surely be 50+ win team.

I was thinking that it was a much smaller gap. That the best WNBA players probably made around 10 million, the average around 1-3 million a year. Boyy I was wrong.

The average WNBA player makes 79,000 dollars a year. The league minimum is 56,000 a year. 

This is terrible. If an NBA player has a serious injury then he has his 20, 30, 40 million to fall back on. If a WNBA player has a serious injury, this could be devestating and they could be broke.

**RULES:**

It's a best of 7 series, just like the playoffs. Let's say that the old-school team had the better season, so they get home court advantage. Each home game the NBA rules pivot between old-school and new-school (i.e. putting hands on your man as a defender), so for example, G1 and G2, old-school rules, G3 and G4, new-school rules. The 3 point shot exists. Let's also say for the sake of argument that the refs are, for the most part, actually unbiased. These are the conditions. If I'm missing anything critical let me know.

A simple example would be Steve Nash beating his man off the dribble, drawing an extra defender, and then passing to the player who the defender left. That's a simple example of playmaking. 

While it's easier to see playmaking in PnR guards such as Harden, CP3, and Nash, there exists play making that doesn't necessarily result in an assist for the playmaker.

A great example would be Steph Curry.  Detractors often pull out his relatively low APG numbers to say ""he's not a true point guard, he's not a playmaker"" but I'm sure you all know of the enormous strain that Curry puts on the defense. Curry also creates off ball by being one of the best relocators in the league. 

Lebron, while an excellent on ball playmaker with great assist numbers, creates more plays for teammates than just the plays resulting in his assists. If Lebron crashes the paint, passes to a player who then passes to another one for the open shot, then the player who last passed the ball got the assist. But it was Lebron who created the shot and hence, made the play. Lebron's not the best example since he has monster APG stats, but he was easy to use as an example of this phenomenon.

Let's take a look about what occurred during these 3 separate games.

#Wilt Chamberlain's 100 point game

[Here is the full article](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1977443-is-wilt-chamberlains-100-point-game-overhyped), I'll just post a brief summary of what happened this game. I highly recommend reading this entire article as it is very interesting.

&gt;Until the context is as widely known as the scoring total, Chamberlain's accomplishment will remain a mythologized achievement, one that gives the Hall of Fame center just a bit too much credit.

&gt;""From accounts of how it went down, the Warriors spent almost the entire fourth quarter fouling to get the ball back and force-feeding Chamberlain the ball,"" writes CBS Sports' Royce Young. ""New York coach Eddie Donovan said, 'The game was a farce. They would foul us and we would foul them.' Chamberlain's shot attempts by quarter: 14, 12, 16, 21. You think in a blowout in today's game that a team would keeping feeding their star like that?""


&gt;It's different for a player's teammates to foul the other team during a blowout, all with the intent of running up an individual's scoring total. That's when things become farcical, as Donovan mentioned in Young's quote.

&gt;The fouls just piled up as the game got increasingly ridiculous. Both teams were intentionally getting refs to blow whistles, and the Knicks were doing everything possible to run the clock out before Wilt got to triple digits.

&gt;Frank McGuire, the head coach of the Warriors, even put in his backups during the closing minutes of the fourth quarter, all with the intention of using them to foul New York and get the ball back into Wilt's hands.

#Davis Robinson's 71 point game

[Here is a great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvak2JkvQ_8&amp;list=WL&amp;index=4) detailing what occurred this game. Again, I'll give the summary


&gt;It would be a year before the Spurs and Magic played again with Shaq &amp; Robinson's personal beef continuing. But there was competing to be done from afar. 

&gt;Entering the final day of the 93-94 NBA season, Shaq was on pace to win the NBA scoring title. He had 33 more points than Robinson on the season each with one game left to play that day. 

&gt;Robinson knew this, his whole team knew this. So they got to work burying Shaq. They fed Robinson over and over and over again. The game was meaningless and it became a blowout quickly, but Robinson kept playing and kept scoring. By the end of afternoon he'd put up 71 points. One of the greatest performances in NBA history in a meaningless game. 

&gt;That is supremely petty. Meanwhile Shaq scored 32 in his final game of the season, resulting in losing the 94 scoring title to Robinson in a wild finish.

---

#Kobe Byrant's 81 point game

[Here is the full game video of Kobe's 81 point game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcVPLnR-c3g)

This, unlike the previous two games, this was very competitive.

By the end of the 1st quarter, Lakers were down 7 points.

By the end of the 2nd quarter, Lakers were down 14 points. During the 2nd quarter, the Raptors had their largest lead of the game by 16 points.

By the end of the 3rd quarter, Kobe went berserk from a 25 point quarter and got the Lakers a 6 point lead.

At the 4th quarter, the game was mostly back and forth with the score difference being around 4-8 points. Usually between a 1 or 2 possession game. But alas, Kobe dropped 28 points in the 4th quarter to seal his 81 point game in a 16 point comeback win against the Raptors.


---
#Summary

All in all, Wilt's &amp; Robinson's team fed them in an absurd way. Not only did they not take out the best player in a blowout, the winning team in the blowout kept fouling to get the ball back for the specific purpose of getting one guy as many points as possible.


Kobe had none of those shameful fouls to stop the game that Wilt had. And Robinson pulled his accomplishment in an absolute blowout where his team wanted him to get all the points to piss off Shaq and their beef. Wilt's game was also an absolute blowout. Robinson's game was the final game of the regular season where the standings would have been unaffected. 99.9% of the time, the star players rest here for the upcoming playoffs, yet Robinson still decided to suit up just for his Shaq beef.

Not to say these aren't impressive performances, it's just in my opinion that Kobe's 81 is the greatest single-game scoring performance in NBA history considering his team was down most of the game and he had to pull an offensive masterpiece to get the comeback win from 16 points down.


Kobe's was all organic, while their were some very sketchy things happening in Wilt's and Robinson's games.

#Wilt Chamberlain's 100 point game

[Here is the full article](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1977443-is-wilt-chamberlains-100-point-game-overhyped), I'll just post a brief summary of what happened this game. I highly recommend reading this entire article as it is very interesting.

&gt;Until the context is as widely known as the scoring total, Chamberlain's accomplishment will remain a mythologized achievement, one that gives the Hall of Fame center just a bit too much credit.

&gt;""From accounts of how it went down, the Warriors spent almost the entire fourth quarter fouling to get the ball back and force-feeding Chamberlain the ball,"" writes CBS Sports' Royce Young. ""New York coach Eddie Donovan said, 'The game was a farce. They would foul us and we would foul them.' Chamberlain's shot attempts by quarter: 14, 12, 16, 21. You think in a blowout in today's game that a team would keeping feeding their star like that?""


&gt;It's different for a player's teammates to foul the other team during a blowout, all with the intent of running up an individual's scoring total. That's when things become farcical, as Donovan mentioned in Young's quote.

&gt;The fouls just piled up as the game got increasingly ridiculous. Both teams were intentionally getting refs to blow whistles, and the Knicks were doing everything possible to run the clock out before Wilt got to triple digits.

&gt;Frank McGuire, the head coach of the Warriors, even put in his backups during the closing minutes of the fourth quarter, all with the intention of using them to foul New York and get the ball back into Wilt's hands.

#Davis Robinson's 71 point game

[Here is a great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvak2JkvQ_8&amp;list=WL&amp;index=4) detailing what occurred this game. Again, I'll give the summary


&gt;It would be a year before the Spurs and Magic played again with Shaq &amp; Robinson's personal beef continuing. But there was competing to be done from afar. 

&gt;Entering the final day of the 93-94 NBA season, Shaq was on pace to win the NBA scoring title. He had 33 more points than Robinson on the season each with one game left to play that day. 

&gt;Robinson knew this, his whole team knew this. So they got to work burying Shaq. They fed Robinson over and over and over again. The game was meaningless and it became a blowout quickly, but Robinson kept playing and kept scoring. By the end of afternoon he'd put up 71 points. One of the greatest performances in NBA history in a meaningless game. 

&gt;That is supremely petty. Meanwhile Shaq scored 32 in his final game of the season, resulting in losing the 94 scoring title to Robinson in a wild finish.

#Kobe Byrant's 81 point game

[Here is the full game video of Kobe's 81 point game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcVPLnR-c3g)

This, unlike the previous two games, this was very competitive.

By the end of the 1st quarter, Lakers were down 7 points.

By the end of the 2nd quarter, Lakers were down 14 points. During the 2nd quarter, the Raptors had their largest lead of the game by 16 points.

By the end of the 3rd quarter, Kobe went berserk from a 25 point quarter and got the Lakers a 6 point lead.

At the 4th quarter, the game was mostly back and forth with the score difference being around 4-8 points. Usually between a 1 or 2 possession game. But alas, Kobe dropped 28 points in the 4th quarter to seal his 81 point game in a 16 point comeback win against the Raptors.

#Summary

All in all, Wilt's &amp; Robinson's team fed them in an absurd way. Not only did they not take out the best player in a blowout, the winning team in the blowout kept fouling to get the ball back for the specific purpose of getting one guy as many points as possible.


Kobe had none of those shameful fouls to stop the game that Wilt had. And Robinson pulled his accomplishment in an absolute blowout where his team wanted him to get all the points to piss off Shaq and their beef. Wilt's game was also an absolute blowout. Robinson's game was the final game of the regular season where the standings would have been unaffected. 99.9% of the time, the star players rest here for the upcoming playoffs, yet Robinson still decided to suit up just for his Shaq beef.

Not to say these aren't impressive performances, it's just in my opinion that Kobe's 81 is the greatest single-game scoring performance in NBA history considering his team was down most of the game and he had to pull an offensive masterpiece to get the comeback win from 16 points down.


Kobe's was all organic, while their were some very sketchy things happening in Wilt's and Robinson's games.

They seemed to end up fine today due to some amazing front office management. 

OKC: Trading away James Harden for 4 million dollars of cap space the year the made the final. Because they ended up signing PG and Melo in 2017 which put them way over the cap. Look at what happened since then and now the OKC rebuild has begun. 

Minnesota Timberwolves: 2009 NBA Draft, with the 5th pick the Minnesota Timberwolves select Ricky Rubio from Barcelona, Spain, then go on to draft Jonny Flynn from Syracuse.  The 7th pick was Steph Curry and the 9th pick was Demar DeRozan. If they picked those two instead, they could’ve built a big 3 of Kevin Love, Steph Curry, and Demar DeRozan. 

Indiana Pacers: What if the Pacers didn’t trade away Kawhi Leonard for George Hill in the 2011 NBA Draft. The Pacers were real contenders in the east from 2012-2014 and took Miami to game 7 in 2013 or 14. Don’t remember which. Miami then went on to lose in 2014 NBA Finals to the spurs because of the defence of a 22 year old Kawhi on Lebron. Imagine they didn’t trade away Kawhi and signed a free agent Point Guard like Patty Mills or Aaron Brooks. I think the Pacers could’ve been NBA champions if they pulled the right moves. 

Last but not least, and it’s really not spoken much about...

Philadelphia 76ers: I know that the 76ers have a great team for the upcoming season and they took the eventual champions Toronto Raptors to 7 games in the ECSF. But they are some draft pick mistakes they made in the last 4 drafts that if picked differently the team could look younger and even better than it is right now. In my opinion they gave Tobias Harris way too much money and signed Al Horford to a poison pill contract (the first two years will be nice but the 2 years when he’s 35-37, it will be painful to see that money being spent on him). In the 2015 NBA Draft, they selected Jahlil Okafor with the third pick when they already already selected Nerlens Noel in 2013 and Joel Embiid in 2014. The fourth pick ended up being Kristaps Porzingis. In the 2017 NBA Draft, they selected Markelle Fultz with the first overall pick.  We all know how that worked out. Imagine they picked D’Aaron Fox or Donovan Mitchell with the third pick instead of trading for the first.  The 76ers also didn’t use any of those players to trade for Jimmy Butler. They could’ve had a line up that looked like 
Fox- Butler- Simmons- Porzingis- Embiid
Or Simmons - Mitchell - Butler- Porzingis - Embiid. I really believe this team would’ve destroyed any team in its way and yes even the Golden States Warriors last season.

I think he's got all the possible upside to become a star in the NBA - elite length for a PG, elite athleticism (40+ inch vertical), a super quick release jump-shot, and a perfect opportunity to learn from Damian Lillard and CJ whilst still being super young.  If you disagree that Anfernee is a good player/has the potential to be a good NBA player, that's totally fine - but this thread is NOT to debate whether he's good or not.

What I am seeking people's thoughts about is - in light of the fact that Dame and CJ just got given five year contract extensions, and at best Anfernee is going to be running the bench unit in the immediate future - what is his possible path to hitting the big-time, if we assume that hypothetically he is a potential all-star talent - and ultimately my card being worth something nice :)

^**My thoughts:**^

This season Neil Olshey has said that they need to empower Anfernee, as a young, talented player, and that he will have the job running the bench unit, and given the ability to play through mistakes which come from being a 20 year old running an NBA offence.  Neil said the team and its staff need to accept that he's ""their guy"" and be patient throughout this initial learning curve. So he will have a role, despite limited to perhaps 20 minutes off the bench, and likely further reduced in the playoffs.

Damian and CJ are signed through to the end of the 2024/2025 season, with Lillard earning 50+ million that season (his salary is tied to cap inflation, CJ's is not not). Lillard particularly is extremely, extremely unlikely to never be traded, and the franchise will likely endeavour to allow him to pad stats towards the end of his career, to allow him to retire one of, if not the greatest Blazer ever.

CJ's contract is more tradable, and despite his commitment to the franchise through his extension, given the player-movement era we now live in, this represents much more of a commitment to a ""secured bag"" than it does to playing in Portland necessarily, however he's of course going to market his decision as such.  What I'm saying is he could always still demand a trade if he decided it was in his best interests to play elsewhere. So the first scenario Anfernee could *POSSIBLY* find himself in an increased role would be if he improves sufficiently, and CJ decides to leave the Blazers for whatever reason - leaving him to play SG alongside Lillard.

Given Portland's large financial commitment to these two stars, this indicates an understandable intention to contend for this coming period.  Neil Olshey has also raised his concerns about whether it is even viable to ""reset"" in a small market like Portland, because fans likely just wouldn't show up - and it's important to have consistent attendance.

This brings me to my **second possible scenario for Anfernee to find himself in a larger role** in the short term - a trade as an asset by Portland in order to acquire a star SF/PF to contend within Dame/CJ's window.

A third possible scenario would be for Anfernee to leave in Free Agency for less money, upon the expiration of his rookie contract.  This would occur at the end of the 2022/2023 season, when he would be 23 years old (the same age at which Dame and CJ were drafted into the NBA) leaving tons of time for him to carve out a productive NBA career, racking up accolades/championships etc. A young player choosing to leave the team who drafted him, despite being a restricted free agent, is very rare, given that it typically means accepting less money, but it is likely to become increasingly common in the player-movement/big-market driven modern NBA.

A fourth possible scenario would be a serious injury to Lillard or McCollum, which would fucking suck, but it's a real possibility given CJ has lead the league in distance travelled, and Lillard has been one of the league leaders in games played and minutes played for his entire career.

Bucks have Giannis and Brook Lopez,
76ers have Horford and Embiid, 
Pistons have Blake and Drummond,

The 2 best defenders on Celtics are Marcus Smart and Jaylen Brown, both versatile but mostly perimeter oriented guys.

**LeBron James** 

**Danny Green** 

**Kyle Kuzma** 

**AD**

**Dwight Howard** 

####Defense####

&gt; Let me get this out of the way because the concern would be that they don't have enough good perimeter defenders. 

&gt; Vogel is an excellent defensive minded coach and playoffs are going to be different then regular season and we can expect LeBron to put some energy on that side of the floor. I also believe defense is also more team oriented then individual parts so it's more of how well a team can communicate and adapt to playing styles. 

&gt; AD and Howard are both good defenders. I know Howard feel off but he was DPOY and his instincts are still there. They will both do a good job of protecting the paint; both are tall, quick and mobile. 

&gt; Green is going to be guarding the opposing PG/ball handler leaving Kuz will be chasing the SG. While Kuz is the worst defender I think his defense liability is exaggerated and he will make improvements this season. He is young and tall but is not laterally quick enough so get's blown by when facing quick elite guards; this is where Vogel really needs to have the team rotate fast enough and AD/Howard are excellent help side defenders. 

####Offense####

&gt; Not much needs to be expanded upon this. They have two superstars and decent role players. AD and Howard are both great at being the roll men and LeBron is amazing PnR ball handler. 

&gt; Kuz is going to be the third star and his shooting is really good compared to last year. If he can shoot like his rookie year he is the perfect fit for this team. He doesn't need the ball and is one of the best at finding open spaces and making a cut. Same with Danny Green. 


####Weakness####

&gt; No team is perfect and match-ups are everything. The only team I could see giving this team trouble are the Clippers if they are matched against each other. 

&gt; PG and KL are elite wing players and Lakers don't have anyone to go 1v1 against them.

Ever since 2015, the Rockets have never beat the Warriors in a playoff series. Now things are a bit different, with the Warriors losing Durant and Iggy and the Rockets replacing CP3 with Westbrook.

**Rockets**

PG: Westbrook

SG: Harden

SF: Gordon

PF: Tucker

C: Capela

6: Rivers

**Warriors**

PG: Curry

SG: D'lo

SF: Klay

PF: Draymond

C: Looney

6: Burks

Warriors Perimeter defense

The Warriors perimeter defense is noticeably worse now with losing Durant and Iggy. Rusell and Curry are both poor perimeter defenders. Before, you could hide Curry on Paul or Gordon, but one of Curry or Rusell will need to defend Westbrook ( I'm assuming Klay guards Harden). Curry has struggled in the past with defending more athletic guards like Westbrook and Kyrie. D'lo might be a better option for Westbrook. While he's not a good defender, he's still 6'5 and may be able to use his length to slow Westbrook down a little bit. Harden, Westbrook, and Gordon will now be able to attack Rusell and Curry a lot easier. Pre-switching won't work as effectively, so Kerr will need to be more creative.

The Rockets Pick and Roll and rebounding issues

Draymond Green shut down the Rockets PnR game very effectively during the 2019 and 2018 series. Draymond's BBIQ was able to confuse Capela and make him look pedestrian. The Rockets need to find a way to make their pick and roll effective against GSW, it's one of their more effective weapons in the regular season. Capela would benefit from adding more weight and becoming a better post-up player and working on finishing at the rim.

Another problem the Rockets have is their size. Their entire starting five is under 6'10 and everyone besides Capela is only 6'6 or shorter. Westbrook's good rebounding will certainly help the Rockets here. Too many times, Houston was getting out-rebounded by Looney and Green. The Rockets should really look to playing the buyout markets or pursuing Serge Ibaka at the trade deadline. His IQ, rebounding and PnR abilities may help the Rockets when Capela rests and he has some floor spacing abilities, which could elevate the Rockets in a matchup against GSW.

The Elephant in the room

We all know the Elephant in the room which is Rusell Westbrook. Westbrook is going to be the bell-weather in a series against GSW. If he performs poorly, the Rockets likely lose, but if he performs well the Rockets will likely win. Westbrook is going to need to at least become a serviceable shooter. He needs to take more C and S threes and stop taking bad shots off-the-dribble. If Westbrook can play composed, take smart shots and attack the basket he can hurt the Warriors a lot. GSW will likely sag of Westbrook, go under screens and give him a gap on the perimeter. Those things will make it more difficult for Houston's offense to work effectively. However, one underrated thing about Westbrook is his playmaking. While he isn't efficient, he is a good playmaker.

Ben Taylor did a great video of how Westbrook's playmaking was crucial to OKC last year. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zhBVMAjAmA

Westbrook will need to effectively play make when Harden is on the bench. He ability to create for others will be crucial for keeping Houston's offense alive when things lull down. However, if he starts making bad turnovers, it will let the Warriors get into transition a lot easier.

The Bench

Both teams now have a relatively light bench. The Rockets have always had poor depth, but they have Nene, Rivers, Chandler and House. Nene played pretty well in 2019, but he's aging and I'm not sure how well he can perform. Rivers is crucial for the Rockets. Rivers was statically Stephen Curry's best defender in the playoffs in 2019, holding Steph to 36 % FG and 15.4 % from three. Rivers is a decent three-point shooter and his defense will be crucial to keeping Curry and D'lo contained. I don't expect Chandler to do much as he's aging and didn't do much with the Lakers last season. Danuel House is an interesting prospect. He's an excellent shooter and has he length to be a very good defender. His development could be key for the Rockets. They are weak at the 3, and House could emerge as a 3 and D type player that could replace Gordon in the starting lineup. The Rockets have fine depth, but they have a glaring weakness at the 3 and Center. I expect them to make some moves later in the season to shore up that position.

The Warriors bench is a little more iffy. They added WCS, Alec Burks and still have Mckinnie and Bogut on the roster. WCS seems to be either boom or bust. He has great athleticism, but his effort level is lacking. I think that WCS has the making of a very good PNR big/ rim protector in the mold of Javale Mcgee. Perhaps being around Draymond, Looney and the rest of the Warriors will improve his outlook. One underrated acquisition by the Warriors was adding Alec Burks. Burks is a good shooter and I think he will benefit from the Warriors spacing. His defense is a little bit questionable, but I think that he can be an effective 6th man on this Warriors team. This Warriors team needs more production from the wing. Whether Mckinnie or another draft pick can provide this remains to be seen. The Warriors will need a strong wing defender if they want to maximize their lineup and small-ball type play, and I would be interested if a wing player ( cough Robert Covington cough) got moved for D'lo at the trade deadline.

Conclusions

The Warriors and Rockets seem more evenly matched than in years prior. I think this series would be very close. The X-factor for the Rockets is Westbrook. His production and fit alongside Harden are going to be crucial to their success.

The x-factor for the Warriors will be their bench. If Burks, WCS and others can provide good team defense and production, they can tire the Rockets shorter rotation out. it will be up to Steve Kerr to find out how to effectively utilize his new bench.

All in all, if the Harden and Westbrook fit well together I see them winning this series in 6 or 7. If the Rockets fall apart or Westbrook's shooting woes continue, the Warriors could cruise to victory in 6 games.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,65164,public,self,How do the Westbrook-Harden Rockets match up with the new-era Warriors?,0,1567973376,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/d10ygu/how_do_the_westbrookharden_rockets_match_up_with/,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, if he starts making bad turnovers, it will let the Warriors get into transition a lot easier.\n\n4. The Bench\n\nBoth teams now have a relatively light bench. The Rockets have always had poor depth, but they have Nene, Rivers, Chandler and House. Nene played pretty well in 2019, but he's aging and I'm not sure how well he can perform. Rivers is crucial for the Rockets. Rivers was statically Stephen Curry's best defender in the playoffs in 2019, holding Steph to 36 % FG and 15.4 % from three. Rivers is a decent three-point shooter and his defense will be crucial to keeping Curry and D'lo contained. I don't expect Chandler to do much as he's aging and didn't do much with the Lakers last season. Danuel House is an interesting prospect. He's an excellent shooter and has he length to be a very good defender. His development could be key for the Rockets. They are weak at the 3, and House could emerge as a 3 and D  type player that could replace Gordon in the starting lineup. The Rockets have fine depth, but they have a glaring weakness at the 3 and Center. I expect them to make some moves later in the season to shore up that position.\n\nThe Warriors bench is a little more iffy. They added WCS, Alec Burks and still have Mckinnie and Bogut on the roster. WCS seems to be either boom or bust. He has great athleticism, but his effort level is lacking. I think that WCS has the making of a very good PNR big/ rim protector in the mold of Javale Mcgee. Perhaps being around Draymond, Looney and the rest of the Warriors will improve his outlook. One underrated acquisition by the Warriors was adding Alec Burks. Burks is a good shooter and I think he will benefit from the Warriors spacing. His defense is a little bit questionable, but I think that he can be an effective 6th man on this Warriors team. This Warriors team needs more production from the wing. Whether Mckinnie or another draft pick can provide this remains to be seen. The Warriors will need a strong wing defender if they want to maximize their lineup and small-ball type play, and I would be interested if a wing player ( *cough Robert Covington* cough) got moved for D'lo at the trade deadline. \n\n5. Conclusions\n\nThe Warriors and Rockets seem more evenly matched than in years prior. I think this series would be very close. The X-factor for the Rockets is Westbrook. His production and fit alongside Harden are going to be crucial to their success. \n\nThe x-factor for the Warriors will be their bench. If Burks, WCS and others can provide good team defense and production, they can tire the Rockets shorter rotation out. it will be up to Steve Kerr to find out how to effectively utilize his new bench.\n\nAll in all, if the Harden and Westbrook fit well together I see them winning this series in 6 or 7. If the Rockets fall apart or Westbrook's shooting woes continue, the Warriors could cruise to victory in 6 games."", 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all saw how the Warriors have owned the Rockets over the last 4 years. Ever since 2015, the Rockets have never beat the Warriors in a playoff series. Now things are a bit different, with the Warriors losing Durant and Iggy and the Rockets replacing CP3 with Westbrook.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rockets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PG: Westbrook&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SG: Harden&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SF: Gordon&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PF: Tucker&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: Capela&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6: Rivers&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warriors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PG: Curry&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SG: D&amp;#39;lo&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SF: Klay&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PF: Draymond&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: Looney&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6: Burks&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; Warriors Perimeter defense&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Warriors perimeter defense is noticeably worse now with losing Durant and Iggy. Rusell and Curry are both poor perimeter defenders. Before, you could hide Curry on Paul or Gordon, but one of Curry or Rusell will need to defend Westbrook ( I&amp;#39;m assuming Klay guards Harden). Curry has struggled in the past with defending more athletic guards like Westbrook and Kyrie. D&amp;#39;lo might be a better option for Westbrook. While he&amp;#39;s not a good defender, he&amp;#39;s still 6&amp;#39;5 and may be able to use his length to slow Westbrook down a little bit. Harden, Westbrook, and Gordon will now be able to attack Rusell and Curry a lot easier. Pre-switching won&amp;#39;t work as effectively, so Kerr will need to be more creative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Rockets Pick and Roll and rebounding issues&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Draymond Green shut down the Rockets PnR game very effectively during the 2019 and 2018 series. Draymond&amp;#39;s BBIQ was able to confuse Capela and make him look pedestrian. The Rockets need to find a way to make their pick and roll effective against GSW, it&amp;#39;s one of their more effective weapons in the regular season. Capela would benefit from adding more weight and becoming a better post-up player and working on finishing at the rim. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another problem the Rockets have is their size. Their entire starting five is under 6&amp;#39;10 and everyone besides Capela is only  6&amp;#39;6 or shorter. Westbrook&amp;#39;s good rebounding will certainly help the Rockets here. Too many times, Houston was getting out-rebounded by Looney and Green. The Rockets should really look to playing the buyout markets or pursuing Serge Ibaka at the trade deadline. His IQ, rebounding and PnR abilities may help the Rockets when Capela rests and he has some floor spacing abilities, which could elevate the Rockets in a matchup against GSW.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Elephant in the room&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We all know the Elephant in the room which is Rusell Westbrook. Westbrook is going to be the bell-weather in a series against GSW. If he performs poorly, the Rockets likely lose, but if he performs well the Rockets will likely win. Westbrook is going to need to at least become a serviceable shooter. He needs to take more C and S threes and stop taking bad shots off-the-dribble. If Westbrook can play composed, take smart shots and attack the basket he can hurt the Warriors a lot. GSW  will likely sag of Westbrook, go under screens and give him a gap on the perimeter. Those things will make it more difficult for Houston&amp;#39;s offense to work effectively. However, one underrated thing about Westbrook is his playmaking. While he isn&amp;#39;t efficient, he is a good playmaker. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ben Taylor did a great video of how Westbrook&amp;#39;s playmaking was crucial to OKC last year.\n&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zhBVMAjAmA""&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zhBVMAjAmA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Westbrook will need to effectively play make when Harden is on the bench.

When we compare prospects and players, we tend to default to more obvious parallels. Sometimes it's about the *look* of a player. *Hey, Brandon Ingram is a super-skinny scorer? Sounds like Kevin Durant to me!*. Sometimes it's about their circumstance. *R.J. Barrett = Canadian = Andrew Wiggins!*

Because of that tendency, one of the most glaring comps may be underplayed: Lonzo Ball and Ricky Rubio. Some have mentioned it, but it should be talked about more often. In fact, their career arcs have some striking similarities.

**uno: Magical Prospects**

In 2018, Luka Doncic came over to the States with an unprecedented resume for a player his age. But before him, Ricky Rubio was the most hyped European prospect of this new century.

Back in his day, Rubio was the definition of a wunderkind. He debuted in the Spanish ACB league at the age of 14, the youngest ever. He won multiple honors in Europe, and even earned a spot on Spain's Olympic team at the age of 18. In those Olympics, he more than held his own, and helped keep the hype growing into near-legend.

In terms of evaluating Rubio as a prospect, his stock felt less about raw stats or tangible athletic traits as much as a ""magic"" touch. He was a big point guard with EXCEPTIONAL vision and passing ability. Whatever the ""it factor"" is, he had it. Naturally, he'd earn some comps to Magic Johnson as a result.

In 2009, Rubio was selected with the # 5 pick by Minnesota, which seems to suggest he wasn't *that* elite of a prospect. However, we have to remember that there was uncertainty about when/if Rubio would come over from Europe at all. In fact, he ended up staying there with FC Barcelona for the next two seasons after being selected. If he had a clear path to the NBA right away, he would have been a top 3 pick if not # 1.

Nearly ten years later, Lonzo Ball and the family circus burst onto the scene. Like Ricky Rubio, Ball was a big point guard whose stock had less to do with raw scoring or athleticism as much as his exceptional passing and feel for the game.

At the time, Ball was also known as an exceptional winner who elevated his team around him. His Chino Hills high school team dominated in California, and he had a similar effect in his freshman season at UCLA. The previous year, the Bruins had gone an embarrassing 15-17. With Ball and his freshmen teammates, they immediately vaulted up to 31-5. Clearly, this kid had the magic touch! The ""it factor""! Magic Johnson himself signed off on the kid, adding to the obvious comparison there. In fact, Johnson and the Lakers jumped on Ball with the # 2 pick.

Even beyond their basketball stock, Rubio and Ball had enormous international profiles for different reasons. For Rubio, it was the European acclaim, and the type of good looks that sparked to young girls and bicurious boys alike. And while we may all roll our eyes at the bombastic Lavar Ball, Lonzo's dad's antics did help generate more attention for his son. To call Rubio and Lonzo Ball ""hyped"" prospects would be an understatement.

**dos: Clear Weaknesses**

While Ricky Rubio and Lonzo Ball hit the ground running in the NBA and started immediately, the holes in their games became more obvious and more concerning than anticipated. For both: the inability to shoot the ball consistently.

Despite extra seasoning in Spain, Rubio stumbled out of the gates with field goal percentages of 35.7% and 36.0% over his first two seasons, truly abysmal numbers. Over time, he's elevated that slightly, but his career numbers still sag at 38.8%. As far as NBA players go (let alone starters), that's a bottom-barrel number. 

Moreover, this isn't a matter of someone simply launching a lot of three pointers (where 38% would represent an excellent mark.) Rubio has shot only 32.2% from three in his career, a number that hasn't improved over time. In fact, he was down to 31.1% last season with Utah. In today's NBA, not being to shoot from long distance is usually a death sentence, so Rubio's ability to withstand that deficiency may oddly be a badge of honor. 

While Lonzo Ball's career is still getting started, he's exhibited a similar distaste for putting the ball in the net. Over his two-year career, he's shot 38.0% from the field (similar to Rubio's 38.8%), and 31.5% from three (similar to Rubio's 32.2%). In fact, you can argue that Lonzo Ball's shooting issues are even more severe than Ricky Rubio's (at least, at this stage), because he's also atrocious from the free throw line. Last season, he shot a mind-bogglingly bad 43.7% from the charity stripe. Oddly enough, Rubio shoots a healthy 83.8% from the free throw line, which does help bump up his true shooting into the 51-52% range these days. But without that type of boost, Lonzo Ball's true shooting last season registered 48.7%, a mark about 6.5% below league average. Not coincidentally, that 48% TS mark is the same as Ricky Rubio's sophomore year in the league.

As mentioned, an inability to shoot usually squeezes you out of the lineup faster than you can forget the name Stanley Johnson, so these two guards clearly have something else working in their favor. And as it turns out, there may be more virtues there than anticipated.

**tres: Unexpected Strengths**

In terms of the ""pros"" and ""cons"" of Ricky Rubio and Lonzo Ball, they largely delivered on what's expected of them. They're not scorers, but they can contribute in other ways with great passing ability and strong rebounding numbers for the position.

However, both Rubio and Ball turned out to be better than expected in one facet of the game: defense.

Coming over from Europe (as a white dude), Ricky Rubio faced the perception that he'd struggle defensively. But as it turns out, Rubio's size and basketball IQ have helped him thrive on that end. ESPN's real plus/minus metric has routinely graded Rubio as one of the best defensive point guards in the league, including a +1.03 mark this past year. To be honest, there's still some debate about the *extent* of Rubio's skill on defense. Other advanced stats (like Five-Thirty-Eight's DRAYMOND) don't grade him as well. Still, we'd count defense as one of his strengths. His length allows him to hang against multiple opponents, and that IQ, savviness, and sticky hands have enabled him to be quite a ball thief. For his career, he's averaged 1.9 steals per game.

Coming out of UCLA, Lonzo Ball had some of those same concerns about his defensive potential. The defining moment in that debate was during UCLA vs. Kentucky, when he continually shied away from guarding De'Aaron Fox, and got roasted by Fox whenever he did try to stay in front of him. The takeaway was that Ball may be a bad NBA defender himself.

Clearly, the opposite has turned out to be true. Lonzo Ball's defense has been among his greatest strengths. Like Rubio, his primary virtues there are his size and instincts/BBIQ. He can guard multiple positions, and can also be a disruptor on defense (with 1.6 steals and 0.6 blocks per game so far.) And like Rubio, Lonzo Ball is a darling of the ESPN RPM metric. That stat graded his defensive impact as a +2.3 as a rookie (3rd best among PGs) and +1.3 this past year (8th best among PGs.)

**cuatro: Wayward Journeys**

Clearly, Ricky Rubio and Lonzo Ball bring a lot of good and bad to the table, and NBA teams need to gauge just how much they value those particular skills and weaknesses. Do the positives (passing + rebound + defense + size) outweigh the negatives (shooting)?

Given the importance of shooting, it's not as easy of an answer as you may suspect. And it's a discussion that has plagued their respective teams.

Early on in Minnesota, the Timberwolves were fully on board with the Ricky Rubio Experience. In fact, they even risked their relationship with statistical stud Kevin Love by not giving him a full five-year deal (saving that for Rubio's free agency to come.) The implication was clear: *Rubio* was their primary building block.

For a while. After 6 years (and 0 playoff appearances), Minnesota felt the relationship had ran stale. They traded their once-franchise player to Utah for a modest price (R1 pick), and turned the job over to a veteran in Jeff Teague. While Teague is a fine starter, no one's ever confused him for a generational talent.

Over the last two seasons in Utah, Ricky Rubio has played well, and helped the Jazz secure playoff tickets. Still, the franchise made a point of getting more shooting this summer, and marked that PG spot as a possible area to upgrade. To that end, they brought in Mike Conley to replace Rubio in the lineup.

But don't cry for Rubio, Barcelona. While he may be on the move once again, he's not exactly a penniless nomad. The Phoenix Suns signed Rubio to a healthy contract this summer (3 years, $17M per season.) Certainly, *they* value his positives over his negatives and consider him a legitimate and quality starter at PG. And for their purposes, he's a clear upgrade at point guard.

Lonzo Ball's faced some similar upheaval in his young NBA career. The Lakers briefly embraced him as a bedrock of the future (and even traded away D'Angelo Russell to help give him more room to grow.) However, the signing of LeBron James changed the timeline and the equation mightily, and turned their native son into the red-headed stepchild overnight. 

After a year of awkwardly trying to get along, the Lakers included Ball in the Anthony Davis package and shipped him off to New Orleans. Because of that package, it's hard to gauge Ball's specific trade value. Still, he's presumably viewed as a true asset by David Griffin and New Orleans, and will have every opportunity to continue as a long-term starter for them.

But for both Ricky Rubio and Lonzo Ball, this year represents an important test case. Do their positives outweigh their negatives? Are they true starters? Their (new) teams think so. But for everyone else, that matter will be a polarizing and [philosophical debate](https://images.app.goo.gl/1KCo4M1DcHmSPSJs7).",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,65097,public,self,TIME IS A FLAT CIRCULO: how Lonzo Ball is following in Ricky Rubio's footsteps,0,1567955845,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/d0x8aa/time_is_a_flat_circulo_how_lonzo_ball_is/,,,,,,,,,,,,

Back in 2016, he was playing for Shandong Golden Stars, as a starting Power Forward, Wu averaged about 8 pts and 5 rebounds per game. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.redd.it/4lpq7aklv2l31.png""&gt;Wu Ke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On Jan.27, 2016, a game during CBA regular season, Shandong was against Tianjin, Wu Ke elbowed a Tianjin player, Jason Maxiell, a former NBA Detroit Piston player, and currently a BIG3 player. Maxiell went mad about the elbow hit and escalated it into a fight. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.redd.it/5d0n9r3sz2l31.png""&gt;Wu and Maxiell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the game, Wu Ke was suspended for 11 games. Though Shandong was able to enter playoff as they finished regular season with 5th position, but losing Wu Ke resulted them into being swept in the first round against Shandong. Team Shandong went home in early Feb, and their star player, Michael Beasley was done with that CBA season with Shandong and was able to sign with Houston Rockets, catching the last bus to the 2016 NBA season.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.redd.it/hkcxutp413l31.png""&gt;https://i.redd.it/hkcxutp413l31.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Houston Rockets was facing the 73-win Golden State Warriors in 2016&amp;#39;s first round of Playoff. Houston was defeated in a 1-4 result in this series. But in this series, Warriors&amp;#39;s Draymond Green was called a technical foul on Beasley, which gets Green&amp;#39;s accumulated technical fouls to 16 times. This means Green&amp;#39;s one more technical away from suspension.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And later, as is famouly known to everyone, Green get another technical on Lebron James during G4 of NBA final, which caused him to be suspended in G5, which was considered a turning point of that series. Eventually, Lebron James was able to lead Cavaliers to a comeback and won 2016&amp;#39;s NBA championship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Warriors later decided they need to step up their game and signed Kevin Durant and won the next 2 NBA titles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe it&amp;#39;s fair to say Cavaliers&amp;#39; Championship in 2016, the signing of KD, and the NBA power rankings of last 3 years were able to be traced back to that elbow play by Wu Ke. This story, should it be told by our kids and later generations, may possibly be remembered as the butterfly effect of global basketball, known as the Wu Ke Effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'steward_reports': [], 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'nba', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2qo4s', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/nba', 'subreddit_subscribers': 2641901, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': None, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'thumbnail_height': 70, 'thumbnail_width': 140, 'title': ""How a CBA player (China's Basketball Association) changed NBA history forever"", 'total_awards_received': 0, 'ups': 134, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/d0qi5p/how_a_cba_player_chinas_basketball_association/', 'user_reports': [], 'view_count': None, 'visited': False, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}]",70.0,140.0,,,,,,

Do you think Dirk and Nash could’ve won a ring together if Cuban didn’t get rid of Nash? 

With Nash, the Mavs had an excellent  offense. While some superstars being paired with each other have diminishing returns (I.e. pairing an on ball PG with Lebron,) Nash and Dirk were perfectly suited for each other. 

Nash and Dirk would play pick and pop perfectly together.

Nash actually played more off ball in his Dallas days too, running off of screens. 

One of Phoenix’s biggest problems that Nash mentioned on the Bill Simmons podcast was that there was never anybody on the Suns who could create offense besides him. Nash’s offensive load and responsibility was ridiculous, and it arguably could have held him back in some ways. 

Dirk immediately solves that problem. Also, the Suns has a transcendent offense but horrible defense. The Mavs had a great offense as well as having better defense.

Unfortunately, that group peaked with their loss to Miami and never returned to the Finals again.

That doc will be so jam packed of ""could have beens"" and ""should have beens"" that it may not have time to mention one of the most important of all. What if Scottie Brooks didn't play Kendrick Perkins so damn much?

If you don't remember, Brooks stuck with the veteran Perkins in the starting lineup, well past the point of stubbornness. The stats suggested they were better without them, but Brooks continually trotted him out there, content to punt the first 6 minutes of every game.

And in a way, it's hard to blame Brooks for that. At the time, Kendrick Perkins was a hard player to bench. He'd won a title in Boston, and garnered a huge amount of respect in the OKC locker room. Shelving him may have led to a rebellion. But unfortunately, *playing* him may have directly led to a loss as well.

I'll always remember that decision because it comes up time and time again. The respected veteran who gets overplayed by a coach. The ""Kendrick Perkins Overplayed Oldie.""

Going forward, I have earmarked three players with the potential to fill that unfortunate role for their teams this season.

**PG Rajon Rondo, Los Angeles Lakers**

The new-look Los Angeles Lakers were going to have a hard time settling on the right lineup even before DeMarcus Cousins went down with injury. The guard spot will be especially tricky to figure out. Reportedly, LeBron James wants to call himself a ""point guard"" now, but he's not actually going to be guarding any point guards. Someone will need to play that position, no matter what they may call it.

My fear, from the Lakers' perspective, is that if they default to the veteran Rajon Rondo. Rondo elicits tons of respect from his fellow players, but that tends to be the *problem*. His reputation dwarfs his actual production. The raw stats may still be solid (8.0 assists in 29.8 minutes last year), but they're not always winning plays. And while he shot well from three last season (35.9%), his true shooting still lagged down at 47% due to poor shooting elsewhere. Defensively, he's relied on his reputation for years now, grading as a -1.4 on ESPN RPM. Overall, it's hard to see Rondo as anything more than a net negative starter these days (at age 33.) 

There appeared to be a path forward for Rondo to be a solid rotation player for the Lakers off the bench, particularly if they played him alongside his old buddy DeMarcus Cousins.  But with Boogie down? Rondo's offensive limitations would become more pronounced in that role as well. He'd be best with bigs (like Cousins, or Anthony Davis) that can space the court, but the Lakers will have plenty of cloggers in the middle now.

The trouble is: the Lakers aren't exactly brimming with other options on the perimeter. They have shooting guards like Danny Green, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope who can perhaps play de facto ""point guard,"" and more limited point guards like Quinn Cook (limited on defense) and Alex Caruso (limited track record.)

The most interesting candidate -- and the one the Lakers should hope to emerge as a reliable option -- is veteran Avery Bradley. Like Rondo, Bradley has been overhyped based on his Boston days for quite a while now. Frankly, he's been one of the worst NBA starters lately. In some ways, he's the anti-Rondo. He can shoot threes (36% career), but can't do much else. Last season, he averaged a modest 2.8 rebounds and 2.4 assists over the course of 30.2 minutes a night.

If you're looking for a positive here, it's that Bradley should be a lot better in a limited role here in L.A. Essentially, he could be a 3+D guard who only launches open threes, and hounds opposing point guards on defense. In reality, his defense has sagged lately as well (also grading as a negative on ESPN RPM.) However, perhaps some of that comes from playing ""up"" in size as a wing when he really should be at PG full-time defensively.

The Lakers should go into this season *hoping* that these veterans can give them good minutes. Avery Bradley could (in theory) fit in as a 3+D guard alongside ball-dominant LeBron James, and Rajon Rondo could (in theory) anchor the bench as a playmaker. But coach Frank Vogel needs to be careful here. These players have not been consistently good lately, so they can't be grandfathered into 25-30 minutes a night based on reputation alone. If they aren't clicking, and Vogel stubbornly refuses to adjust accordingly, we may have some ""Perk"" potential here.

**PF Jeff Green, Utah Jazz**

A three-year veteran in college and a survivor of heart surgery, Jeff Green has always been one of the most respected players in the NBA. He's a good guy, and he's willing to fit it to whatever role the team wants from him.

Unfortunately, his reputation may have always surpassed his actual value (dating back to the days when he was seen as a core piece for Oklahoma City.) He's about ""average"" in every category, and can drift down into the ""below average"" camp when the wind shifts.

Last season with Washington was actually one of Jeff Green's best seasons. He averaged 12.3 points in 27.2 minutes, pumping in a strong 60.8% true shooting. Still, you wonder if that may be a little bit of fool's gold. For his career, he's only a 33.3% shooter from beyond the arc, and only registers a 53.7% true shooting. And while he may look the part on defense, he's graded as a negative there lately as well (-1.21 ESPN RPM.) At 33, his legs do not move as well as they used to.

It's too early to tell exactly what role Quin Snyder and the Jazz have in store for Green. Their summer was all about adding offensive weapons like Mike Conley and Bojan Bogdanovic. Still, there's a real chance that Snyder defaults to Green as the ""starter,"" and plays him 20-25 minutes a night because he projects as a more natural PF than Bogdanovic at this stage in his career.

Given his modest contract (vet minimum), Jeff Green was a solid signing for Utah. He's the type of player who can fill in minutes at SF and PF and not hurt you badly. However, Snyder needs to be careful not to over-rely on Green, particularly if his shot isn't falling.

**PG Derrick Rose, Detroit Pistons**

Coming into last year, I grumbled about the Minnesota Timberwolves bringing Derrick Rose back. Clearly, they needed to let him go and hand the reins at backup PG to Tyus Jones. Clearly, Derrick Rose's hot three-point shooting from the playoff before would not last more than a few weeks.

In that way, Rose proved me wrong. He played well (offensively) all season long for Detroit. We always knew he could score (18.0 PPG in 27.3 minutes), but he continued to shoot well, nailing 37% of his threes. You could make the argument that he was a true Sixth Man of the Year contender, and at minimum, that he was at least a good backup PG.

So what's the problem here? The concern is if Dwane Casey and the Detroit Pistons treat him as *more* than that. Even now, Rose has more name value than current starter Reggie Jackson. There may be a clamor for Rose to take a heavy share of those PG minutes, or even to play alongside Jackson with a two PG lineup.

In my opinion, there's a danger of over-extending Rose here. While he can still light it up, he's a defensive liability these days (at age 30). In fact, he graded as an atrocious -2.53 in ESPN RPM. You can make the case that his offense kinda-sorta makes up for that as a bench playmaker, but in the starting lineup (or with starters-level minutes), that becomes problematic.

Moreover, I'm worried that Casey may play Rose more minutes at the expense of some younger players on the roster: namely SG Luke Kennard. Casey never fully warmed up to Kennard, but he has the true offensive skill that makes up for any defensive liability. To take the next step out East, the Pistons need Kennard to be good. Playing Rose big minutes would be a Band-aid, not a long-term fix. In fact, if Casey overplays Rose (and his shooting cools off) he may be a net negative for them and make their playoff berth more dicey than expected.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,64993,public,self,"[OC] the potential ""Kendrick Perkins Overplayed Oldie"" team",0,1567810830,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/d088pi/oc_the_potential_kendrick_perkins_overplayed/,,,,,,,,,,,,

I never knew about his Sonics and Suns stints, and also that he was a afroed high flyer that put up points and had some attitude issues.

Another guy was Adrian Dantley.  I only saw him on the Pistons for a bit and then how the Aguirre trade pushed them over the top.  I would have had no idea what an offensive force he was with the Utah Jazz just a few years earlier. 

On the other hand, I remember having quickly known about the reputations of guys like Moses Malone before he was a Hawk, or Bernard King on the Bullets, so I always had the notion that they used to be big-time players that could still drop numbers on you.

I would have put it in this thread as a comment, but I wrote too much.

Would love to see everyone's thoughts and to see people tear up my opinions.

PG:  

1. Curry - This is an easy one in my opinion. You can make arguments for other guys I guess, but no one can really say that someone arguing for Curry is just downright wrong.
2. Lillard - This is where it gets tough, I feel like you can pretty easily put Lillard, Kyrie, and Westbrook in any of the next three spots so I'm going off my own bias here.
3. Irving - See above.
4. Westbrook - See above.
5. Simmons -  I'm a huge believer he's a top 5 player in the NBA if he get's a consistent jumpshot and continues to get better at the other parts of his game, but until then I'm not sure.  I just really like everything else about his game, and I'm banking on him developing that jumper more before the season.
6. Murray - These next few guys are also pretty interchangeable, I like Murray because I just think he's going to get better and better, and what I saw from him in the playoffs made me a believer, that's the main reason I have him here. I'm sure a bunch of people will think I have him too high and I can understand why, but oh well.
7. Fox - I'm huge on this kid, he's very talented and hard working. I'm a bit of a hypocrite putting him above Kemba because he's never even been to the playoffs, but I have the Kings fighting for that 7/8 seed in an extremely tough Western Conference.  They have a young core, and not many people see him because it's the Kings, but he'll put people on notice this year.
8. Walker - I've seen him be the best player on a mediocre team for years, haven't seen much in the playoffs, I think that made his performances better. He won't have the same stats this year because of that, and I think Tatum will be the best player on that team, but that still doesn't take away from his ability, he's insanely skilled, and I think he'll showcase that in the playoffs more than the regular season.
9. Young - I just love watching him play. He brings excitement back to Atlanta, and it's tough to find more point guards who will be better than him this year. I think they'll make a playoff push, and I think he'll be the driving force behind it. Although, I don't even think he's the best player on his team, but that's later in the list.
10. Russell - I think he's more of a 2 this year, but I'll keep him at 1, you can't find someone better to put here. I can see the case for Conley or Paul, but he had a hell of a year last year, and I think he'll fit in better than people think with the Warriors, especially with Klay out for the first half at least.

SG:  

1. Harden - Pretty self explanatory, I don't know if you can argue against this rationally.
2. Doncic - I think he'll just get better and better from his rookie season. I believe he's the real deal and he's going to be up there in the ""next best player"" argument in a few years.
3. Mitchell - The same for Doncic goes for Mitchell, he's actually insane, and he'll have more weapons that defenses have to key in on in Bogdanovic, Conley, and Gobert.  I think he'll have better stats all around, and we'll see that rookie year playoff Mitchell again, since they'll be fighting for a higher seed.
4. Derozan - He's getting older but he can still score, played some good defense last year, and the Spurs are getting Murray back this year, which I think will just open his game up even more.
5. Beal - Haven't heard much from him the past couple of years, but that's because the Wizards are well... bad.  His stats are steadily getting better though, not sure what to expect because I don't follow him, but I'm hoping for a good year.
6. Booker - I think he has the ability to be a top 3 or 4 SG in the league, but I want to see him do more than just score a lot on a bad team. With that being said, I think he could possibly be the best pure scorer on this list, and possibly in the league (hard to compare him with Harden, Curry, or Durant, but I can see it).
7. McCollum - I just think he's too undersized for the position, he's an insane scorer, but he'll always be limited on the defensive end. I still love him as a player, but the defense moves him down the list for me.
8. Lavine - Same as Booker, but he's not as good of a scorer, I think he can be the best player on a playoff team, but I just have to see it, the Bulls may or may not have fixed their PG problems with Coby White in the future, but he'll be taking on a lot of the ballhandling and playmaking roles again this year, which I think hurts him as a scorer, which I think is where he shines more.  There's also no reason he shouldn't be one of the best defenders in the position barring his injury, would love to see him get better on that side of the court.
9. Fournier - The guy can flat out score, and statistically he's like the third most clutch player in the league. I fully expect the Magic to make the playoffs again, and I feel he'll be a big part of it. I'll probably get some flack for this pick, but just watch him, he can flat out play, if not just a bit undersized on defense.
10. Heild - He's just an all around player. He can get buckets, he's a decent playmaker, he's a good ballhandler, and he plays good defense. I think he's only going to get better year after year, and I don't think he gets the looks because he plays for the Kings. He's my early pick for Most Improved Player this year.

\*I fully acknowledge those last few spots can be taken by lots of players, Lou Williams, Josh Richardson, Jeremy Lamb, etc... But if we're going on who's going to have the best year, I'll take these guys based on their roles on their respective teams. Some just get more of an opportunity to show how good they really are.

\*This is the toughest list, and everyone behind Harden can be pretty interchangeable.

SF:  

1. Leonard - I'm biased, I love Kawhi, I've been saying he's the best player in the league if he's healthy for the last 2/3 years, and that's as a Cavs fan with LeBron on my team, but you can just as easily, and probably should put LeBron here.
2. James - Pretty self explanatory. I think he'll go down as the best player of all time before he retires. 
3. George - I want to put Jimmy Butler here, but PG was a top 3 MVP player last year, and I see no reason besides his injury that he won't be again, even with Kawhi on his team.
4. Butler - One of the most cold-blooded players in the league. Him being as good a 2-way player as he is puts him higher on this list.
5. Gallinari - Another couple spots that are interchangeable, I just think he'll have more of an opportunity to show out this year than he did last year.
6. Middleton - Can put this guy one step up as well. He just got paid though so we'll see. I like his defense a bit better than Gallinari, but I've been a Gallinari fan for awhile so mostly bias.
7. Tatum - I think he'll grow to be the best player on the Celtics this year, and I think he'll be an all-star. He's also only going to get better, can't wait to watch him without Kyrie there.
8. Bogdanovic - The dude can score, I've even been watching him in FIBA, and obviously the competition doesn't match up to the NBA, but he just makes it look effortless.
9. Ingram - This is a bit of a reach, I just really want to see him succeed and be the player that a lot of people expected him to be coming out of college. I think a new start with a new team is going to do wonders for him, but I also think this is his last year to show out, or he'll never be more than just a rotational piece.
10. Wiggins - I don't like Wiggins, but his downright potential to be a top player in the league puts him on this list.  He's steadily gotten worse since his rookie year, and that's never good, but I still have hope he can have a hell of a year.

\*No Durant, he won't be playing.

PF:  

1. Antetokounmpo - This is pretty self explanatory.
2. Anthony Davis - He seems to think he's a true 4, so since you didn't put him on any list, I'm going to put him as a 4.
3. Blake Griffin - He has refined his game so much that I only think he's going to get better, he's a complete player now, and I believe he'll lead the Pistons to a 4 or 5 seed in the East, but I'm very biased towards him. 
4. Draymond Green - Pretty self explanatory as well, if we're talking how important these players are to a team, this guys second on this list no doubt.
5. Siakam - He's the number one guy now, and he has a lot of veteran leadership to help him become that guy. He has a skillset similar to Kawhi, just really needs to refine his game.
6. Porzingis - If he comes back healthy he's just as good if not better than any of the players above him, but a new team, system, and coming off an injury puts him lower on my list.
7. Randle - I like Randle, watched him a lot last year, and I think he'll have really good stats, but on a horrific team, that to me puts him down on this list. Lot's of the guys above him would just put up better numbers on the same team, in my opinion.
8. John Collins - He's super young, but I just think he has an all around game, he's the only one on this list that I think can be a superstar besides the guys who already are.
9. Jaren Jackson Jr - See above.
10. I'm torn but probably Harris - He's just an insane offensive player, and I think he could be an average defender with effort and if he worked at it.

C:  

1. Embiid - This guy is a beast, he needs to work on his conditioning and he can be a bit mediocre at times in certain situations on defense, but overall he's the best Center we've seen in this game for a long time in my opinion.
2. Jokic - This is also pretty self explanatory, he's the best playmaker we have in the game besides LeBron probably.  He doesn't have the flashiest stats, but he flat out wins games. I think the only reason I put Embiid (or Davis possibly) over him is because he can be a liability on defense. I wouldn't be surprised to see him average a triple double this year.
3. Towns - Similar guy to Embiid, just not as absolutely dominant as Embiid, but pretty darn close.
4. Gobert - In my opinion, he's the best defensive player on this list. I don't watch him enough to judge his offense, but with guys like Mitchell, Conley, and Bogdanovic, he doesn't really need to be as dominant on that end, just catch lobs and get offensive rebounds.
5. Drummond - It's hard to put him this high, but I don't think I can put anyone below him on this list above him. He's just really good at all facets of the game. He scores fairly well, he's the best rebounder in the league, and plays good defense.
6. Horford - Skill wise, I can see players below him better, but he's the heart and soul of pretty much any defense he's on. He is what makes this Sixers team scary in the East defensively. He may not have the best stats this year, but he doesn't need to score as much, doesn't need to rebound as much, doesn't need to guard the best player as much. He just understands how to play the game. 
7. Aldridge - One of the most skilled offensive players on this list. His height get's him some blocks but he's not a dominant defender.
8. Vucevic - The most underrated player on this list probably. Similar to Drummond, but a better offensive player. He can shoot, rebound, score, make plays, and plays good defense. In my opinion he could also be above Aldridge, but I'll leave it as it is.
9. Capela - I like Capela for what he does. He's not going to give you low post scoring, or a knockdown shooter. But he's going to give you energy, defense, and rebounding.  I also think he's the best screen setter in the league besides maybe Steven Adams.
10. Turner - This is another player I'll probably get flack for, but considering he's only 22 years old, he's only going to get better. His game reminds me of Embiid and Towns as well, just not as good on the offensive end and better or just as good on the defensive end.

Player by player, the starting 5 seems to be Lonzo-Jrue-Zion-Ingram-Favors, but that lineup lacks spacing and would fill the lane a lot (but would be amazing defensively). An alternative is playing Reddick at the 2 and move Jrue to the PG, relegating Lonzo to the bench, but Lonzo is the kind of player that improves a lot if he has talented scorers around him. Another option is starting Melli at the PF position and have Ingram be a scoring option in the bench, where he would be surrounded by good shooters and have the ball in his hands a lot, but Melli is not NBA proven yet and most probably not ready to be a starter.

This added spacing should help Randle score more since players will have to respect his teammates shooting. A concern here though is playing with Robinson.

The relationship between the government of China and the NBA and basketball in general is a tricky subject. On the one hand, basketball is the most popular sport in China and will be very important for the overall growth of the sport in the future. It is very positive to see so many people passionate about the sport and generates a lot of income for the NBA and its players. The growing prominence of China in the field of basketball is also evidenced in the country currently hosting the 2019 FIBA World Cup.

However, the Chinese government's severe persecution of its people and horrendous human rights record makes this relationship and the hosting of the world cup a difficult issue. 

As the tournament progresses, democracy protestors in Hong Kong are being arrested and beaten  up by police, over 1 million Uyghurs are being arbitrarily detained in internment camps, lawyers and activists are being rounded up and tortured, Tibetans are seeing their language and culture being eroded and Chinese Christians face significant persecution and are being arrested for practicing their faith, among many other serious human rights violations.

In other tournaments or international sporting events, human rights concerns are regularly raised or addressed in some meaningful way. In Qatar, news outlets continue to raise the many serious abuses occurring. In an opinion piece today in the Guardian, Karim Abdul Jabbar wrote that athletes should raise civil rights and social issues, saying:

""It is an opportunity to do more than promote themselves for endorsement deals for clothing and their face on a box of Wheaties. It is a chance to let the world hear the rational voices that demand social justice, inclusion and protection of the marginalized and productive diplomacy.""

However, to my knowledge, not a single basketball player, NBA official or national basketball association has raised any human rights concerns in China in any way, despite the fact that policies from the Chinese government may amount to crimes against humanity. While basketball players historically (and currently) have been active in bringing about social change and pushing for equality and respect for civil rights domestically, there are few instances of any players applying the same concern to international issues. It seems that players are content to ""Shut up and dribble"" in China.

Why do you think that is? China's massive market and the numerous partnerships the NBA has with Chinese companies may play a role, but players should be less beholden to market forces.

Do you think athletes have a moral duty to use their platform to raise these concerns or is this best left to states and activists?",True,False,,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,64795,public,self,"China, the FIBA World Cup and Human Rights",0,1567612403,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cz6pcd/china_the_fiba_world_cup_and_human_rights/,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0

Obviously there are other guys who at one point were better than the four I just named, but currently I believe these are the best second round picks out there. Jokic is an MVP candidate that is also an international superstar. His teammate Paul Millsap is pretty solid as well, and considering his career before the NBA he might be one of the best second round picks of the last two decades. Brogdon is on his way up and looks to prove himself in Indiana. He and Oladipo can become a scary good duo, and might take the Pacers far. Lastly we have Montrezl Harrell.

James Harden and Anthony Davis

Vs

Steph Curry and Giannis Antetokoumpo




The Beard and the Brow virtually have no weakness on Offense. The weakest link of this duo is AD playmaking and that is an aspect that AD actually improved in recent years, averaging a tad over 5apg last season.

Steph and Giannis are the perfect complimentary where they can take turn dominate from 3 and from the paint. Steph can stretch the floor leaving Giannis wide open in the paint while Giannis can demand attention in the paint leaving Steph wide open from 3. Their presence on the court also make teammates better simply because of the Gravity they bring. Curry off ball and Giannis ball handling combine bring a different dynamic that would compliment team ball so much better than Harden and AD.

Harden and Davis PnR is virtually unstoppable. Much like Curry Durant PnR as one would imagine. Trap Harden? AD roll for finish, or Pick and Pop. Switch? Automatic mist match Harden gonna dance on the big man defender for step back 3 or AD easy Bucket on the low block. You can’t afford to give anything for these 2, (AD mid range is pretty automatic in Pick and Pop), have to force other guys beat you. The Beard and the Brow 2 man game is as perfect as it gets. 


Steph Giannis PnR is just as deadly. Imagine the Steph Draymond PnR where Draymond mostly finds teammates open from corner 3 or alley oop and occasion lay up for himself this is Giannis that will take off from the FT if there’s a wide open lane and he’s more capable of finding open shooters. Switch and it’s a bad mismatch. Trap Curry, ball fall to Giannis with smaller defenders scrambling for help of a Giannis in middle of the floor clearing for take off or a wide open corner 3.

Presently, the U.S. is starting Kemba Walker, Donovan Mitchell, Harrison Barnes, Jayson Tatum and Myles Turner... A fairly solid lineup that has great upside in the back court. My issue though, is that Kemba and Mitchell are somewhat redundant playing next to each other because they both have very similar, high-usage, ball dominant games. Would it be better to start Marcus Smart at the 2 over Donovan Mitchell?

I think this would provide both Kemba and Mitchell more liberty to take over and look for their own shot without being unselfish. Also, This would allow Marcus Smart to play lockdown defense on their best ball handler from the beginning.

In the life cycle of most prevalent memes or circlejerks the community in which the information is propagating reaches a point of annoyance. There is a backlash (counterjerk/meme fatigue).
  
We are clearly at this point concerning the information that Karl Malone impregnated a 13 year old. There was a Karl thread today and all mention of this information was heavily downvoted. Now the counterjerk posits that anyone posting about Malones evil deed is simply hunting for karma. People are exploiting Malones crime as a karma grab.
  
I am not convinced. This info used to be one of those little known facts that was brought up in the middle of a long comment chain about a subject. I remember reading about it many years ago on reddit. Lately, whether by the cultural wave of #metoo or pure coincidence this information about Karl is being shared at a much more rapid pace.
  
You could argue karma is involved with every post on reddit. And some karma whoring is obvious and transparent. I dont think the posts about Karl Malone are obvious karma whoring. I think we are in a cultural moment sensitive to male abuse of women and people are responding to this information as part of a broader cultural phenomenon. This is a specific case that connects a popular figure in the NBA to something larger. People are naturally going to latch onto this information and keep it ready to disseminate.
  
There is raw emotion surrounding this issue. I think there are many people that don't care if they get karma or not when they post the Karl thing. They want the whole world to know what this man did. It's their little crusade on their lunch break. It may seem trivial but I believe this kind of action is a net positive. We need culture to spam outrage and disdain at sexual abuse. Those with power should be scared to take advantage of others. We are changing the world with all this social activity around the issue. I know women in my life who note a marked difference over the last decade in how they are treated in public. Shits not perfect by any means but we are making progress IMO.
  
Anyway. I dont feel bad for Karl getting shat on thread by thread. He deserves it, and Im not so sure people are motivated solely by karma to do so. It's pertinent that it's being shared a lot *now*. There is a large question at play here as well - should Rose/Bryant and others get a pass or the same treatment?

A motion offense often favors a ton of passing within the possession and ball movement to confuse the defense. The point guard in a motion offense very often will give the ball up super early as the rest of the team plays hot potato with the ball to get the best possible shot. 

The modern motion offense does share a lot of similar principles with D’Antoni’s 7 seconds or less. It emphasizes quick decisions, spacing the floor, and a certain degree of ball movement. 

Because D’Antoni loves the PnR, we saw a lot of Nash controlling the possession on-ball, with Nash controlling the ball and making a pass to a roller or shooters on the outside. 

If we subbed Nash into a good motion offense (2014 spurs, 2016 hawks, or 2016 warriors), would he able to be as effective a player as we remember him being? 

As a natural consequence of playing in this system, his APG would go down a bit and he would have to play off ball more.  

People refer to Nash as a “proto Curry” type player all the time so that made me think a lot about how they would be in different systems. 

I think he could still be super effective and it would be really,really interesting to see him play in this kind of system.

But I am more interested in defensive types.  You know, the George Hill vs Marcus Smart ""types"" of defensive players.  For instance, despite both players being generally considered good defensive players, Hill seems to play passing lanes to a much more extent than Smart, who I'd consider a 'grip and rip' type.  Smart loves to get low and use his body to get as far under the offensive player as possible.  Once this is done he feels for the ball to forcefully rip it away from the offensive player.  Hill seems to play a half step or so further back than Smart and not as concerned about ripping away anything.  But he seems to be more interested in playing far enough away from the ball to deflect or intercept a pass.  

Then there are the unique players who do not really fit into any type - such as Delon Wright.  He leans toward the Marcus Smart School of Defense but is more of a stalker type.  Maybe Jack the Ripper type (today is the anniversary of the 1st Jack the Ripper killing).  Wright is always around the ball on defense.  He leaves his man (by a long ways) to be around the ball, usually trying to sneak in from behind for a steal.

I'm sure lots of players have had to make adjustments as they advance to a higher level of play.  Some of those adjustments are made to avoid exposing weaknesses - for instance, some players have their own personal defensive rule to NEVER attempt a steal unless it is a cross-over dribble.  If it's not a cross-over, do not attempt the steal or you'll get beat (that's the justification for the rule).   There are exceptions, of course, though usually based off offensive mistakes.   Anyway, what all types of defensive players have you come across?  It would be interesting to see the similar and opposite characteristics.  I'm sure there are types of defensive post players, perimeter players and on the ball defenders.

Use 0.423 instead).

**Explaining What True Shooting Percentage (TS%) is**

Most people use TS% as a measure of how efficient a player is at scoring, while taking into account three pointers taken and free throws attempted. The formula for TS% is below:

    TS% = PTS / (2 * (FGA + 0.44 * FTA))

* PTS  = Points
* FGA = Field Goal Attempts
* FTA = Free Throw Attempts

Now we get to the two coefficients:

* **2**: This value is literally used to make the ""Shooting percentage"" look like a shooting percentage. Without this value, this TS% gets called out for what it really is - *Points per scoring possession*. It really isn't a ""true"" shooting percentage (all puns intended) because a perfect shooting night doesn't result in 100%. If Player X shoots 1 three and makes it, he would have scored 3 points in one possession, giving him a Points per possession of 3 and a TS% of 150% (Half of PPP). The other piece of fraud TS% attempts is with the second coefficient...
* **0.44**: This value is meant to correlate free throws to field goals. Why? Because the main point of TS% is to determine how many scoring opportunities you need to put up the number of points you put up. If Player X takes one shot and makes it, that is the end of the possession, whether it is a 2 or a 3. This means that there is a 1:1 ratio between possessions and FGAs, which is why FGA doesn't need a coefficient. Free throws on the other hand, aren't as easy to dissect. If you get fouled on a Three point attempt, you now have 3 Free Throws in one possession, meaning that there's a 3:1 ratio between 3PT FTs and possessions. There are also 2:1 ratios for 2PT FTs and a 1:0 ratio for technical free throws + and-one opportunities. To compensate for the variety of FTA:Poss ratios, the NBA used an empirical value based on how often these events occur on average. The 2 biggest flaws for me is this: The data may be too old to accurately represent the Average FTA ratio and it assumes that every player has an average FTA distribution.

**Testing the New TS% - Rudy Gobert vs Thomas Bryant**

*Thomas Bryant*

* Points = 758
* FGA = 502
* FTA = 137
* TS% = 67.40%

*Rudy Gobert*

* Points = 1284
* FGA = 712
* FTA = 522
* TS% = 68.18%

At first it looks like Gobert is slightly more efficient than Bryant. Is this fair? Not really. Because they are both tied to the universal 0.44 value, the TS% model is assuming that both Gobert and Bryant are shooting an average ratio of 3PT FTs and 2PT FTs (one is alot more efficient than the other). Lets update their coefficients with an updated TS% formula;

    TS% = PTS / (2 * (FGA + (FT2 / 2) + (FT3 / 3))

* FT2 = Free throws on 2PT attempts
* FT3 = Free throws on 3PT attempts

Using the updated formulas, Bryant's TS% goes up 0.88% to 68.29% and Gobert's goes down to 67.37%. Using the old formulas, Bryant's ""0.44"" value should actually be 0.387 for the 2018-19 season and Gobert's should be 0.448. This shows that Bryant was more efficient than Gobert this season, and has been getting the short end of the stick by being judged by an unfair standard. The data is available, I don't understand why we still use an approximation coefficient for things we have the data for, both NBA.com and BBall ref can separate 3PT Fts from 2PT Fts.

Does this matter? Is this an insignificant difference? Maybe, maybe not. Here's the updated TS% and the coefficients for every player + whose TS% was impacted the most.

**Head Coach: Dwane Casey (2011-18)**

Accolades w/Team: 320-238 Regular Season Record, 21-30 Playoff Record

**Assistant Coach: Nick Nurse (2018-)**

Accolades w/Team: 58-24 Regular Season Record, 16-8 Playoff Record, 1 Finals Appearance, 1x NBA Champion

**Assistant Coach: Lenny Wilkens (2000-03)**

Accolades w/Team: 113-133 Regular Season Record, 8-9 Playoff Record

&amp;#x200B;

**PG1: Kyle Lowry (2012-)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x NBA Champion, 5x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 17.4 PPG, 4.9 RPG, 7.1 APG, 1.5 SPG, 0.3 BPG

In the six seasons before Kyle Lowry got traded to the Toronto Raptors, he was an okay player as he averaged 10.4 PPG, 3.5 RPG, and 4.8 APG with the Grizzlies and Rockets. He was much of the same in his first season in Toronto, averaging 11.6 PPG, 4.7 RPG, and 6.8 APG. However, Lowry improved as their starting point guard over his next two seasons as he averaged 17.9 PPG, 4.7 RPG, and 7.1 APG while making the All-Star team in the second of those two seasons. Lowry continued his improvement in the two seasons after that, averaging 21.7 PPG, 4.8 RPG, and 6.6 APG while making the All-Star team both times and making his only All-NBA team in the former of both seasons. Over the last two seasons, Lowry has reduced his scoring while increasing his playmaking as he has averaged 15.3 PPG, 5.2 RPG, and 7.7 APG which helped the Raptors win the championship this past season.

&amp;#x200B;

**PG2: Damon Stoudamire (1995-98)**

Accolades w/Team: 1995-96 Rookie of the Year

Stats: 19.6 PPG, 4.1 RPG, 8.8 APG, 1.5 SPG, 0.2 BPG

With their first-ever selection in an NBA Draft, the Toronto Raptors drafted Damon Stoudamire with the seventh overall pick of the 1995 NBA Draft. The “Mighty Mouse” had a really good rookie season in the Raptors’ inaugural season as he averaged 19 PPG, 4 RPG, and 9.3 APG en route to winning that year’s Rookie of the Year. Stoudamire continued to develop as the young “leader” of the also young Raptors in his second season as he averaged 20.2 PPG, 4.1 RPG, and 8.8 APG. However, after averaging 19.4 PPG, 4.4 RPG, and 8.1 APG in 49 games with the Raps in his third season, a disgruntled Stoudamire was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers during that season.

&amp;#x200B;

**PG3: Jose Calderon (2005-13)**

Stats: 10 PPG, 2.5 RPG, 7.2 APG, 0.9 SPG, 0.1 BPG

Jose Calderon signed with the Raptors during the 2005 offseason and was a decent player off the bench in his first two seasons who averaged 7.2 PPG and 4.8 APG. However, Calderon saw an increase in minutes in his third season and had a much-improved season as he averaged 11.2 PPG and 8.3 APG. Calderon got the full-time starting point guard role the following season, averaging 12.8 PPG and 8.9 APG in the 2008-09 season while shooting 98.1% from the free-throw line. After having his minutes slightly reduced in the 2009-10 season, Calderon’s assists numbers went back to normal over the next two seasons as he averaged 10.1 PPG and 8.9 APG while retaining his starting role. However, Calderon was benched for Kyle Lowry during the 2012-13 season and was later traded to the Pistons after 45 games in Toronto that year.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG1: Vince Carter (1998-04)**

Accolades w/Team: 6x All-Star, 1999 Rookie of the Year, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 23.4 PPG, 5.2 RPG, 3.9 APG, 1.3 SPG, 1 BPG

Drafted fifth overall in the 1998 NBA Draft, Vince Carter started his NBA career very strong as he averaged 18.3 PPG, 5.7 RPG, 3 APG, and 1.5 BPG en route to winning the Rookie of the Year. Carter’s second season was a huge one, averaging 25.7 PPG, 5.8 RPG, and 3.9 APG while making the All-NBA 3rd Team. This also marked the birth of “Vinsanity” as during the All-Star weekend of that season, Carter had the [greatest slam dunk contest performance of all-time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OJMLCF5oK4). It didn’t stop there for Carter as he followed that up with an even better third season where he averaged 27.6 PPG, 5.5 RPG, and 3.9 APG which earned him a spot on the All-NBA 2nd Team. However, Carter’s next three seasons were marred by injury and team disappointment, although he was still an All-Star in each of those three seasons, averaging 22.8 PPG, 4.8 RPG, and 4.1 APG during that span. Even though Carter had a huge impact on basketball in Canada, he was traded to the New Jersey Nets after 20 games in the 2004-05 season after he demanded a trade during that 2004 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG2: DeMar DeRozan (2009-19)**

Accolades w/Team: 4x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 19.7 PPG, 4.1 RPG, 3.1 APG, 1 SPG, 0.3 BPG

Drafted ninth overall in the 2009 NBA Draft, DeMar DeRozan started in all nine of his seasons with the Toronto Raptors. He averaged 8.6 PPG in his rookie season, but he showed improvement over the next three seasons as he averaged 17.4 PPG and 3.7 RPG during that span. He followed that up with an All-Star selection in the 2013-14 season, averaging 22.7 PPG, 4.3 RPG, and 4 APG while helping the Raptors make the playoffs for the first time since 2008. After a very good 2014-15 season where he averaged 20.1 PPG, 4.6 RPG, and 3.5 APG, DeRozan made the All-Star team in each of the next three seasons as he posted averages of 24.5 PPG, 4.5 RPG, and 4.4 APG in that span while being selected to an All-NBA team in the latter two seasons of those three years. However, the Raptors seemed to always come up short in the playoffs, especially in the second half of DeRozan’s Raptors tenure, and he was traded to the Spurs during the 2018 offseason for Kawhi Leonard.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG3: Doug Christie (1996-00)**

Stats: 14.2 PPG, 4.6 RPG, 3.8 APG, 2.1 SPG, 0.6 BPG

The Raptors traded for Doug Christie during their expansion season, and it turned out to be a very good move for the team. After averaging 10.1 PPG, 3.8 RPG, and 2.9 APG in his first 32 games in Toronto, Christie improved in his first full season with the Raptors as he averaged 14.5 PPG, 5.3 RPG, 3.9 APG, and 2.5 SPG. Christie continued with his very good play on both sides of the game over the next two seasons as he averaged 16 PPG, 4.8 RPG, 3.7 APG, and 2.4 SPG during that span. However, with the emergence of rising young star wings Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady, Christie’s averages went down to 12.4 PPG, 3.9 RPG, and 4.4 APG in the 1999-00 season, and he was traded to the Sacramento Kings during the 2000 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF1: Kawhi Leonard (2018-19)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x NBA Champion, 1x Finals MVP, 1x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Even though he only played in one season as a Toronto Raptor, Kawhi Leonard is one of the greatest Raptors players of all-time, if not the greatest one. Acquired in a trade with the Spurs during the 2018 offseason, the Claw averaged 26.6 PPG, 7.3 RPG, 3.3 APG, and 1.8 SPG in his only season in Toronto which earned him an All-Star selection, an All-NBA 2nd Team selection, and an All-Defensive 2nd Team selection. However, the 2019 playoffs would be huge for Leonard as he averaged 30.5 PPG, 9.1 RPG, 3.9 APG, and 1.7 SPG in 24 postseason games while helping the Raptors win their first NBA championship with Leonard winning the Finals MVP, averaging 28.5 PPG, 9.8 RPG, and 4.2 APG in six games against the Golden State Warriors. However, Kawhi decided to return home during this past offseason and decided to sign with the L.A. Clippers.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF2: Morris Peterson (2000-07)**

Stats: 12 PPG, 3.8 RPG, 1.8 APG, 1 SPG, 0.2 BPG

Drafted 21st overall in the 2000 NBA Draft, Morris Peterson was a solid bench player in his first season, averaging 9.3 PPG and 3.2 RPG. However, Peterson got a starting role in each of the next two seasons as he averaged 14 PPG and 4 RPG during that span. Although he returned to a bench role in his fourth season, Peterson had a bit of a bounceback 2004-05 season as he averaged 12.5 PPG and 4.1 RPG. The next year would be his best his season of his career as Mo Pete averaged 16.8 PPG and 4.6 RPG while having an excellent shooting season, shooting 39.5% from three on 5.5 attempts per game. Peterson averaged 8.9 PPG in his final season with the Raptors while coming off the bench before signing with the New Orleans Hornets during the 2007 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF3: Tracy McGrady (1997-00)**

Stats: 11.1 PPG, 5.5 RPG, 2.5 APG, 1 SPG, 1.4 BPG

Drafted straight out of high school with the ninth overall pick in the 1997 NBA Draft, Tracy McGrady was an underperforming bench player in his first two seasons. He averaged 8 PPG and 4.8 RPG during that span on just 20.2 MPG. However, the young McGrady had a breakout year, as the second option to Vince Carter, in his final season with the Raptors as he averaged 15.4 PPG, 6.3 RPG, 3.3 APG, 1.1 SPG, and 1.9 BPG while garnering the starting job in the middle of that 1999-00 season. After that season, T-Mac wanted to have his own spotlight, and he signed with the Orlando Magic during the 2000 offseason where he blossomed into a superstar.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF1: Chris Bosh (2003-10)**

Accolades w/Team: 5x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 20.2 PPG, 9.4 RPG, 2.2 APG, 0.8 SPG, 1.2 BPG

Drafted fourth overall by the Toronto Raptors in the 2003 NBA Draft, Chris Bosh had a solid rookie season as he averaged 11.5 PPG and 7.4 RPG. However, after the Raptors traded Vince Carter during the middle of his second season, Bosh improved in that season, averaging 16.8 PPG and 8.9 RPG. He was named to his first All-Star selection in the 2005-06 season while he averaged 22.5 PPG and 9.2 RPG. Over his final four seasons in Toronto, Bosh remained among the best big men in the NBA as he averaged 22.9 PPG and 10.1 RPG during that span while making the All-Star team in each of those four seasons. After averaging 24 PPG and 10.8 RPG in the final of those four seasons, Bosh decided to sign with the Miami Heat during the 2010 offseason, especially with the Raptors missing the playoffs in Bosh’s final two seasons there.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF2: Pascal Siakam (2016-)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x NBA Champion

Drafted 27th overall in the 2016 NBA Draft, Pascal Siakam was a hidden gem for the Raptors. Siakam started in 38 games in his rookie season, but he spent a lot of his time in the D-League where the helped the Raptors 905 win that league’s championship. In his second season, Siakam played in 81 games, averaging 7.3 PPG and 4.5 RPG off the bench while helping the Raptors reach the playoffs. However, this past season would be a breakout one for Siakam as he averaged 16.9 PPG, 6.9 RPG, and 3.1 APG which helped him win the Most Improved Player and helped the Raptors win the NBA Championship as Spicy P averaged 19.8 PPG, 7.5 RPG, and 3.7 APG in six games against the Golden State Warriors. Heading into the 2019-20 season, Siakam looks to improve even more, especially without Kawhi in the picture.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF3: Andrea Bargnani (2006-13)**

Stats: 15.2 PPG, 4.8 RPG, 1.3 APG, 1 SPG, 1.1 BPG

Even though Andrea Bargnani underperformed considering he was drafted first overall in the 2006 NBA Draft, he was still a solid offensive player in his seven seasons in Toronto. Bargnani averaged 10.8 PPG and 3.8 RPG in his first two seasons, but he improved in his next two seasons, averaging 16.3 PPG and 5.8 RPG in that span. However, with the departure of Chris Bosh in the 2010 offseason, Bargnani had a really good 2010-11 season as he averaged 21.4 PPG and 5.2 RPG. Although Bargnani averaged 15.8 PPG and 4.5 RPG over his next two seasons, he only played in 66 games from both years and was bad at defense. Thus, he was traded to the Knicks during the 2013 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**C1: Antonio Davis (1999-03)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star

Stats: 12.9 PPG, 9.2 RPG, 1.7 APG, 0.5 SPG, 1.3 BPG

After being acquired by the Raptors in a trade with the Indiana Pacers during the 1999 offseason, Antonio Davis had the best season of his career, at the time, in his first season in Toronto as he averaged 11.5 PPG and 8.8 RPG. Davis followed that up with an All-Star selection in his second season in Toronto, averaging 13.7 PPG, 10.1 RPG, and 1.9 BPG while helping the Raptors make the second round of the 2001 postseason. Davis never made the All-Star team before or after that, but he was still very good over the next two seasons as he averaged 14.2 PPG and 9.1 RPG during that span. However, Davis was traded to the New York Knicks after struggling in the first 15 games of the 2003-04 season.

&amp;#x200B;

**C2: Jonas Valanciunas (2012-19)**

Stats: 11.7 PPG, 8.5 RPG, 0.7 APG, 0.4 SPG, 1 BPG

Even though Jonas Valanciunas was drafted fifth overall in the 2011 NBA Draft, he did not join the Raptors until the start of the 2012-13 season. He had a solid rookie season as he averaged 8.9 RPG and 6 RPG which got him a spot on the All-Rookie 2nd Team. Valanciunas was one of the best offensive centers over the next five seasons as he averaged 12.1 PPG and 8.9 RPG as the starting center of the Raptors while shooting 55.8% from the field. However, Valanciunas was seen as a liability on defense, and he was traded during the Raps’ 2018-19 championship season to the Memphis Grizzlies for Marc Gasol.

&amp;#x200B;

**C3: Serge Ibaka (2017-)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x NBA Champion

Stats: 13.9 PPG, 7.1 RPG, 1 APG, 0.4 SPG, 1.4 BPG

Serge Ibaka was traded to the Raptors during the 2016-17 season to provide interior defense, and he was solid in 23 games for them that season, averaging 14.2 PPG and 6.8 RPG. Ibaka continued that solid play in his first full season with the Raptors as he averaged 12.6 PPG and 6.3 RPG while helping them win the most games in the Eastern Conference that season. Even though Ibaka came off the bench somewhat often in this past season, it was his best with the Raptors as he averaged 15 PPG and 8.1 RPG while helping the Raptors win their first NBA championship.

**Analysis**

* In the starting lineup, the wing duo of Vince and Kawhi is a really good one as they are both really good scorers and shooters with the latter of the two being an exceptional defensive player. In addition, they have playmaking and solid scoring point guard Kyle Lowry and a really good scoring and rebounding power forward in Chris Bosh.

That got me thinking, would lebron actually be willing to take an entire step back and let AD be the big dog on a nightly basis, while he mostly focused on making plays and setting him up. That would not only help incite AD to stay on the lakers, but it would also allow lebron to preserve energy on the offensive end as well as hopefully exert more energy on defense.

Harden needed a guy who could take off scoring and ball-handling pressure. This is why he struggled in the postseason but now that Westbrook is there, he can have more catch-&amp;-shoot opportunities and he can even have breaks offensively. 

As for Westbrook, he never had a team full of great shooters. PG was good but not great. Now he can expect to facilitate and not score, which means you might see Westbrook play solid defense now that he doesn't have to shoot 24 shots. 

And for Houston as a whole, they needed a guy who could cut, finish at the rim, and get to the FT line. With Westbrook it seems they filled that role.

which is the obvious choice since its a generalized process and they are a objective institution that has no stakes in these sports and no business hiding this (I am not saying that the WADA is perfect and always right but its for sure the best option out there)

the NBA takes a different approach - they test the athletes themselves which leaves A LOT of questions:

- do they test as often and especially as surprising as the WADA (for further clarification: if you are an athlete under the vision of WADA they at any time have to know where you are traveling and can control you at any time they like which is of course stressful in some situations but also somewhat necessary

- can the NBA drug testing be a 100% objective? I dont wanna get into some weird conspiracy theories or anything like that but just imagine a simple situation: Player X (lets take Lebron for example since he is best for showing what I mean) gets tested for drugs in April after he came back from his injury and he is being tested positive for substance XYZ - what holds back the NBA from just dropping the results under the carpet and ignoring it because it would be a huge revenue loss is Lebron would miss the playoffs due to a drug violation 

- why are the disciplines so untransparent and vary heavily? Tyreke Evans was tested positive for cocaine and gets a 2 year ban (same for OJ Mayo) - Wilson Chandler gets tested positive for PEDs (that a) are actually banned for over 2 years opposed to Chandlers statement AND are really not a normal drug a doctor would hand you out, its known as a substance thats abused in the bodybuilding scene (fyi: he took Ipamorelin)

if you test positive under the WADA you get a 2 year ban no matter what so why does the NBA not do that - Wilson Chandler is a bad example here because he only makes the minimum salary this year but just assume he would have signed a 3y/30m contract this offseason which he got be cheating and using PEDs which made him better than he actually is and gave him an unfair advantage over other players SO now he only has to sit out not even a third of a season and only losses 3m of his 30m deal? how unfair is that

also its kinda ridicoulus again that at the same time you indeed can get a 2 year ban like Tyreke Evans if you use cocaine which is obviously also unacceptable but its not a PED and really doesnt give you any kind of competitive advantage as far as I know

And from there, Pippen went on to become a 7x NBA All-Star, 10x All-Defensive (8 with Chicago, one with Houston and one with Portland), 1994 NBA All-Star MVP, led the NBA in steals per game averages in '94-'95 with 2.9 steals per game, and went on to win all six NBA Championship rings alongside Michael Jordan.

However, by 1998, Pippen wanted out of Chicago after 11 seasons because he felt underpaid and Jerry Krause wouldn't pay him or renegotiate his contract, and so he became a free agent and with Jordan's second retirement and the Bulls rebuilding with Toni Kukoc as the main man, Pippen was signed-and-traded to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Roy Rogers (whom Houston acquired from the Toronto Raptors when the Rockets sent Kevin Willis to the Raptors in 1998 just before the lockout began).

With the Houston Rockets, Pippen (with a newly-signed five year $67.2M contract, and fresh off his back surgery after the 1998 NBA Finals vs. the Utah Jazz) played third banana next to Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley. The age difference between their starting backcourt and starting frontcourt felt night and day, as Cuttino Mobley and Michael Dickerson were rookies and starters at PG and SG, while Pippen, Barkley and Olajuwon were starters at SF, PF and C as expected. Even though Hakeem, Barkley and Pippen were an aging trio of stars, the Rockets were still expected to be back as NBA Championship contenders.

For the 98-99 regular season, Scottie Pippen (not really the same otherworldly two-way star after back surgery) averaged 14.5 points, 6.5 rebounds, 5.9 assists and 2.0 steals in 40 minutes per game as Houston didn't really have a suitable backup at SF to spell Pippen off the bench, as Eddie Johnson barely played, and Sam Mack turned out to be a flop in his second go-around with the Rockets just after he became known as a 3PT marksman with the Vancouver Grizzlies.

In the 1999 NBA Playoffs, the Houston Rockets took on the Los Angeles Lakers (led by Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and former Hornets superstar Glen Rice) where Pippen averaged 18.3 points, 11.8 rebounds, 5.5 assists, and 1.8 steals in 42-43 minutes per game as he scored an easy matchup against Rice, as Rice wasn't exactly known for defense. Pippen's most notable playoff game for the Rockets was Game 3 where Hakeem and Barkley were in foul trouble, so Pippen was allowed to score from the paint, which led to 37 points. But the Rockets still lost the series to the Lakers after a four-game sweep.

Overall, Pippen shot inefficiently when he made 5.8 field goals out of 17.5 (.331%), with 2.0 three-pointers made out of 5.5 (.363%), and got most of his points from the free throw line when he hit 5.3 out of 6.5 (.815%). And then Pippen and Barkley had their feud after the 1999 NBA Playoffs ended, and wanted out of Houston because he felt he wasn't being utilized correctly. He went from being the ""point forward"" for the Chicago Bulls to being miscast as a catch-and-shoot player (a la Robert Horry) in Houston, and so Pippen finally got what he wanted, as he went to the Portland Trail Blazers in a six-for-one deal as he was traded in exchange for Brian Shaw, Ed Gray, Stacey Augmon, Walt Williams, Carlos Rogers and Kelvin Cato. However, only Walt, C. Rogers and Cato played for Houston, while Shaw, Gray and Augmon never suited up for the Rockets as Shaw went to the Lakers, Ed Gray was out of the NBA afterwards and Augmon went back to the Blazers soon after, and Pippen became a veteran role player for the rest of his NBA career with Portland and a second but short stint with the Bulls.

What are your thoughts about Scottie Pippen's one-and-only season with the Rockets where he began his slow decline, him being reduced from MJ's sidekick to third banana next to Hakeem and Charles, and his 1999 playoff matchup against Glen Rice of the L.A.

### LA Clippers ###

**Injuries and Center Depth** 

&gt; KL is the star of that team and he missed little over 20 games last season. His load management is going to be a big priority for the clippers. His production in undeniable but his knee injury is something not to be ignored. 

&gt; PG and Bev both have injury issues as well. Beverly averaged the least minutes of his career outside of his rookie year. While PG is the better out of the three and started 75 games over the last three seasons he has nagging shoulder injuries that hurts his performance on the offensive end. If team is healthy that is no concern, PG just needs to be a defensive monster and not take primary offensive load. 

&gt; Center Depth: With the exception of Zubac this is the one position that they are severely lacking in depth. Harrell is fine as a small ball 5 but he can't bang against the bigger players and while Zubac was good for the Lakers he was also getting spoon fed by LeBron and Rondo. His defense is suspect and they couldn't even play him in the playoffs.

### LA Lakers ###

**Guard Depth and secondary star**

&gt; Lakers are lacking depth at their guard position. LeBron and Rondo are the only play-makers of that team; they are also two of the oldest. Rondo has his injury concerns and while he isn't the worst backup for LeBron I don't see him getting too many minutes because of his defense. Caruso is an option and he showed promise but the sample size is too small. LeBron and his minutes NEED to be limited if we are to see them go in the playoffs. 

&gt; Yes yes they do have a secondary superstar in AD but he isn't like Irving or Wade. The majority of his buckets are generated by point guards like Rondo or Jrue or LeBron. He isn't the type of player to dominate during the clutch. That is not to say he won't but his play-style during the crunch can be stifled

&gt; Defense is another problem. Green and AD are their best defenders and you can throw LeBron in the mix during the playoffs but they Green can't guard bigger wings and you can't have LeBron waste his energy on that end. Hopefully Howard and Kuz can plug some of the holes.

### Houston Rockets ###

**There is only one ball to go around**

&gt; That was the argument when CP3 first joined the Rockets and that narrative aged poorly. CP3 is one of the best PG's in the league. He has everything in the bag and alas age is one of them too. We have yet to see if Russ and Harden can keep the Rocket's system alive or if the team can adapt to any new system MDA can come up with.

&gt; Harden and Russ are both not known for their off-ball movement. This was actually a big point over summer where sources claimed CP3 wasn't happy with the play-style. When Harden doesn't have the ball he often rests on the corner letting CP3 do his thing. We rarely see him cutting or using screens to get himself open and scrabble the defense. 

&gt; Russ has the same issue and in-addition he is poor shooter in a system that relies heavily on players who can space the floor and play defense. We have yet to see if this combo will fizzle out or explode. 

### Nuggets ###

**Crunch time offense and depth at SF**

&gt; I think the Nuggets are lacking in SF depth on defense. They don't have anyone who can guard the likes of KL, LeBron, PG, and such. All of their players at SF are old. Positions however are not that important in today's game but match-ups are. 

&gt; Jokic is a star. We all know that but outside of him who is their second star? Murry is amazing but can be inconsistent. Last season they were 20th in free throw percentage, and they’re 21st in free throws in the clutch. 

### GS Warriors ###

**Depth and Defense** 

&gt; Klay hurts this team more on the defensive end then the offensive end. I think Dlo is a great addition to their team offensively but his defense is pretty bad and inconsistent. Curry and Dlo are both league average on defense and can't guard wings. Draymond is getting old and can't be expected to guard wings either and Looney is their best center. 

&gt; WCS is great for running PnR and catching lobs but is inconsistent and terrible on defense. 

&gt; Iggy and KD are also both gone from the team. Age and Depth will take a toll on the warriors and while they make it to the playoffs it won't be easy and this will be their 5th playoff appearance.

When you look at the numbers, cuts by every measurement is the most efficient way to score the basketball.   Thus any player that can generate the most cutting opportunities becomes the most efficient player in the game.   That efficiency becomes value over time.  

At first, this logic seems pretty straight forward.  Oh of course cuts are the most efficient way to score, so what?  It doesn't really matter, does it?  In fact, It matters far more than we give credit for.  Look throughout history.  MJ back in the 80s, Lost in the first round 3 years in a row.  Until of course the Bulls added Phil Jackson who installed the triangle. A system of using a players talent and gravity in the post to generate cutting opportunities.   With that system, MJ won 3 straight Championships twice.   Look at Bill Russell's success over Wilt.  Russell played team basketball with passing while wilt played iso ball with him getting all the stats.  Wilt didn't win more championships because his teams didn't generate cuts.   

Cutting stats also explain some of the weird things we see in defensive plus-minus stats.  Why is it Danny Green is so much more impactful in DRPM than Klay Thomson when we can clearly see with our eyes Klay is good at defense?  The answer is Cutting defense.   cutting is the most efficient way for a team to score, so preventing cutting opportunities becomes the most important skill defensily a player could have.    Klay Thomason is a great on-ball defender, but we tend not to notice his off-ball defense.  While Green is a good, not great on-ball defender but his off-ball preventing cuts is something we never even think about.  Still though, because preventing off-ball cuts is so important Danny Green DRPM stats show a far greater impact.   

All this leads me to say.  Nikola Jokic will be MVP in 2020.   Having a big man that can hit cutters like steve nesh while also having big man value combined leads him to be the most valuable player in the game.    We've already seen how Jokic was able to lead the often injured Nuggets to the second seed in the west as the only all-star.   Given a healthy Gary Harris, one of the best cutters in the game, Jokic will lead the Nuggets to 60+ wins and win his first of many MVPs.

Rules are as usual; 2-4 players at each position, players are included based on their tenure with the team, and I can move players out of position if I feel that's what's best for the team but I can only move them one position up or down. Anyways, onto the team!

**PG1: Stephen Curry (2009-)**

Accolades w/Team: 5 Finals Appearances, 3x NBA Champion, 2x NBA MVP, 6x All-Star, 3x All-NBA 1st Team, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 23.5 PPG, 4.5 RPG, 6.6 APG, 1.7 SPG, 0.2 BPG

Drafted seventh overall in the 2009 NBA Draft, Stephen Curry is the greatest shooter of all-time and he’s played 10 seasons so far, all with the Golden State Warriors. The 6’3” Curry was a solid player in his first two seasons as he averaged 18 PPG, 4.2 RPG, and 5.9 APG while shooting 43.9% from three-point range on 4.7 attempts per game during that span. After a 2011-12 season marred by ankle injuries, Curry had a breakout 2012-13 season where he averaged 22.9 PPG, 4 RPG, and 6.9 APG while setting a record for most three-pointers made in a season at the time with 272. After being to the All-Star team for the first time in the 2013-14 season, Curry won the MVP, as well as his first championship, in the 2014-15 season as he averaged 23.8 PPG, 4.3 RPG, and 7.7 APG while breaking his own record with most threes in a single season with 286. Curry followed that up with a historical 2015-16 where he led the Warriors to 73 wins and won the MVP unanimously as he averaged 30.1 PPG, 5.4 RPG, 6.7 APG, and 2.1 SPG while demolishing his own record with 402 three-pointers that season. Curry’s scoring went down over the previous three seasons, with the addition of Kevin Durant, as he averaged 26.3 PPG, 4.9 RPG, and 6 APG during that span while making an All-NBA in each of those seasons and winning two championships. With KD in Brooklyn, Curry is set to have a huge scoring season in the 2019-20 season, and not only is he a great shooter, but he’s an excellent playmaker as well.

&amp;#x200B;

**PG2: Tim Hardaway (1989-96)**

Accolades w/Team: 3x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 19.8 PPG, 3.6 RPG, 9.3 APG, 1.9 SPG, 0.2 BPG

Tim Hardaway was drafted 14th overall by the Golden State Warriors, and he was very good immediately as he got the starting point guard in his rookie year while averaging 14.7 PPG, 3.9 RPG, and 8.7 APG. Over the next three seasons, Hardaway was the floor general on the early 1990s Warriors that were always among the top-scoring team and made the All-Star team in each of those three years as he averaged 22.7 PPG, 4 RPG, 10 APG, and 2.2 SPG while also making two All-NBA teams during that span. However, Hardaway missed the entire 1993-94 season due to a knee injury, but he was very good in the next season as he averaged 20.1 PPG, 3.1 RPG, and 9.3 APG. Despite Hardaway somewhat bouncing back after that knee injury, Hardaway was benched after 19 games in the 1995-96 season, and he was traded during that season to the Miami Heat.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG1: Klay Thompson (2011-)**

Accolades w/Team: 5 Finals Appearances, 3x NBA Champion, 5x All-Star, 2x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 19.5 PPG, 3.5 RPG, 2.3 APG, 0.9 SPG, 0.5 BPG

Drafted 11th overall by the Golden State Warriors in the 2011 NBA Draft, Klay Thompson will be starting alongside his Splash Brother on this All-Time team. After averaging 12.5 PPG in his rookie season, Klay became the full-time starting shooting guard over the next two seasons as he averaged 17.5 PPG over both years while shooting 40.9% from three-point range on 6.5 attempts per game. The second Splash Brother has made the All-Star team in each of the last five seasons as he averaged 21.6 PPG, 3.7 RPG, and 2.4 SPG during that span while being the second or third option and shooting 42.3% from three on 7.7 attempts per game. Klay’s sharpshooting has helped the Warriors make the Finals in each of the past five seasons while helping them win three championships in those five Finals appearances. After tearing his left ACL in Game 6 of this past season’s Finals, Klay will miss the first few months of the upcoming season, but his excellent shooting has helped the Warriors from time-to-time.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG2: Paul Arizin (1950-52, 1954-62)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x NBA Champion, 10x All-Star, 1952 All-Star Game MVP, 3x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 22.8 PPG, 8.6 RPG, 2.3 APG

The Philadelphia Warriors drafted Villanova’s Paul Arizin with their territorial selection in the 1950 NBA Draft and hit a huge home run with that choice as one of the best scorers of the early years of the league. After averaging 17.2 PPG and 9.8 RPG in his rookie season, Pitchin’ Paul had a huge second season as he averaged a league-leading 25.4 PPG and 11.3 RPG en route to an All-NBA 1st Team selection. Arizin spent the two years after that with the U.S. Marine Corps, but he returned before the 1954-55 season while making the All-Star in each of his eight seasons after that as he averaged 23.1 PPG and 8.2 RPG during those eight years. During that span, Arizin was selected to an All-NBA Team three more times and helped the Warriors win an NBA championship in 1956 as he averaged 27.6 PPG and 8 RPG in five NBA Finals games against the Fort Wayne Pistons. After the Warriors relocated to San Francisco for the 1962-63 season, Arizin decided to stay in Philly and retire.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG3: Tom Gola (1955-62)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x NBA Champion, 4x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 13.6 PPG, 9.9 RPG, 4.9 APG

Tom Gola was selected by the Philadelphia Warriors with their territorial selection in the 1955 NBA Draft, and he was a solid all-around player in his first season as he averaged 10.8 PPG, 9.1 RPG, and 5.9 APG while helping the franchise win an NBA championship that season. After taking a one-year hiatus by serving in the U.S. Army, Gola returned to play for the 1957-58 season and averaged 14.2 PPG, 10.3 RPG, and 4.8 APG during the next five seasons while making the All-NBA 2nd Team once and the All-Star team thrice during that span. After the Warriors moved to San Francisco before the 1962-63 season, Gola averaged 13 PPG, 7 RPG, and 3.5 APG while playing the first 21 games of that season for them before being traded to the Knicks in that same season.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG4: Jeff Mullins (1966-76)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 1x NBA Champion, 3x All-Star

Stats: 17.5 PPG, 4.5 RPG, 4.1 APG, 0.8 SPG, 0.2 BPG

Jeff Mullins was traded to the San Francisco Warriors before the 1966-67 season, and he proved to be solid for the team as he averaged 15.9 PPG, 5.4 RPG, and 3.7 APG over his first two seasons with them. However, Mullins saw an increase in his scoring over the next four seasons as he averaged 21.8 PPG, 5.3 RPG, and 4.9 APG during that span which helped him garner three All-Star selections out of those four years. After averaging 17.1 PPG, 4 RPG, and 4.1 APG in the two seasons after that, Mullins’s minutes started to decrease beginning with the 1974-75 season as he averaged just 7.1 PPG over his final two seasons before retiring after the 1975-76 season.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF1: Rick Barry (1965-67, 1972-78)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearance, 1x NBA Champion, 1x Finals MVP, 8x All-Star, 1967 All-Star Game MVP, 1965-66 Rookie of the Year, 5x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 25.6 PPG, 7.3 RPG, 5.1 APG, 2.3 SPG, 0.5 BPG

Drafted fourth overall in the 1965 NBA Draft by the San Francisco Warriors, Rick Barry thrived immediately as he averaged 25.7 PPG and 10.6 RPG in his rookie season while winning that year’s Rookie of the Year award and making the All-NBA 1st Team. Barry improved even more in his second season as he averaged a league-leading 35.6 PPG, 9.2 RPG, and 3.6 APG while helping the Warriors reach the NBA Finals that year. Barry jumped to the ABA after the 1967 NBA Finals, but he returned to the Golden State Warriors in 1972 and averaged 23.7 PPG, 7.8 RPG, and 5.5 APG over his first two seasons back. However, Barry had a huge 1974-75 season as he averaged 30.6 PPG, 5.7 RPG, 6.2 APG, and 2.9 SPG which helped him make the All-NBA 1st Team and the Warriors win the championship that year as he averaged 29.5 PPG, 4 RPG, and 5 APG in four NBA Finals games against the Washington Bullets which won him the Finals MVP. Barry averaged 22 PPG, 5.6 RPG, 5.9 APG, and 2.2 SPG over his final three seasons in Golden State before signing with the Houston Rockets in 1978 as a free agent.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF2: Chris Mullin (1985-97, 2000-01)**

Accolades w/Team: 5x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 1st Team, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 20.1 PPG, 4.4 RPG, 3.9 APG, 1.7 SPG, 0.6 BPG

Drafted seventh overall by the Golden State Warriors in the 1985 NBA Draft, Mullin was solid in his first two seasons as he averaged 14.7 PPG during that span, but he improved quite a bit in his third season, averaging 20.2 PPG, 3.4 RPG, and 4.8 APG. Mullin emerged as the leading scorer of one of the best offenses of the early 1990s over the next five seasons as he averaged 25.8 PPG, 5.6 RPG, and 4.1 APG while shooting 52.3% from the field and 35.4% from three during that span while making the All-Star team in each of those five seasons. However, in the last of those five seasons, the 1992-93 season, Mullin’s season ended after 46 games due to an injury in his right thumb. He was never the same scorer after that as he averaged 15.4 PPG, 4.2 RPG, and 4.3 APG over his final four seasons in Golden State before being traded to the Indiana Pacers during the 1997 offseason. He returned to the Warriors for one more season before the 2000-01 season and averaged just 5.8 PPG in 20 games before retiring after that season.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF3: Latrell Sprewell (1992-97)**

Accolades w/Team: 3x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 20.1 PPG, 4.3 RPG, 4.7 APG, 1.7 SPG, 0.7 BPG

Although drafted 24th overall in the 1992 NBA Draft, Latrell Sprewell had a solid rookie season as he averaged 15.4 PPG, 3.5 RPG, and 3.8 APG. However, Sprewell saw a huge jump in his second season, averaging 21 PPG, 4.9 RPG, 4.7 APG, and 2.2 SPG while making the All-NBA 1st Team and All-Defensive 2nd Team. After averaging 19.7 PPG, 4.3 RPG, and 4.1 APG over the next two seasons, Spree had his best season in the 1996-97 season as he posted averages of 24.2 PPG, 4.6 RPG, 6.3 APG, and 1.7 SPG which resulted in his third All-Star selection as a member of the Golden State Warriors. Spree had a really good start to the 1997-98 as he averaged 21.4 PPG, 3.6 RPG, and 4.9 APG over the first 14 games. However, Sprewell choked his coach, P.J. Carlesimo, in early December and was suspended for the remainder of that season before being traded to the Knicks before the 1999 season.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF1: Kevin Durant (2016-19)**

Accolades w/Team: 3 Finals Appearances, 2x NBA Champion, 2x Finals MVP, 3x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 1st Team, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 25.8 PPG, 7.1 RPG, 5.4 APG, 0.8 SPG, 1.5 BPG

Even though Kevin Durant played small forward for a majority of his three-year stay in Golden State, he played at the power forward position in the Hamptons Five lineup. KD signed with the Warriors, coming off a 73-win season, on the fourth of July in 2016 after nine years with the OKC Thunder, and he got a lot of heat for that move. Durant averaged less on a stacked him, but he was really good in his first season as he averaged 25.1 PPG, 8.3 RPG, and 4.8 APG. He helped the Warriors win an NBA championship that year as Durant won Finals MVP while averaging 35.2 PPG, 8.2 RPG, and 5.4 APG in five games against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Durant had another huge season in the 2017-18 season as he averaged 26.4 PPG, 6.8 RPG, and 5.4 APG en route to his second All-NBA selection in Oakland while helping the Warriors yet another championship with KD winning yet another Finals MVP as he averaged 28.8 PPG, 10.8 RPG, and 7.5 APG in four games against the Cavs. KD averaged 26 PPG, 6.4 RPG, and 5.9 APG in this past season, but he strained his calf in the semifinals and later his Achilles tendon in Game 5 of the NBA Finals against the Raptors. After the season, KD signed with the Nets during this past offseason, but he was valuable in his three seasons there.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF2: Draymond Green (2012-)**

Accolades w/Team: 3 Finals Appearances, 2x NBA Champion, 3x All-Star, 2016-17 Defensive Player of the Year, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team, 3x All-Defensive 1st Team, 2x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 9.1 PPG, 6.9 RPG, 4.9 APG, 1.4 SPG, 1.1 BPG

Drafted 35th overall in the 2012 NBA Draft, Draymond Green did not do much for the Golden State Warriors in his first two seasons while averaging just 4.6 PPG and 4.2 RPG in that span. However, Green started at power forward in his third season and averaged 11.7 PPG, 8.2 RPG, 3.7 APG, 1.6 SPG, and 1.3 BPG while making the All-Defensive 1st Team and helping the Warriors win the NBA Finals that year. Over the next three seasons, Green continued to be one of the league’s best all-around and defensive players as he averaged 11.8 PPG, 8.4 RPG, 7.2 APG, 1.6 SPG, and 1.4 BPG during that span while helping the team win two more championships and making the All-Star team in all three of those seasons. Although Green’s scoring fell off quite a bit this past season, he was still valuable as he averaged 7.4 PPG, 7.3 RPG, and 6.9 APG which got him a spot on the All-Defensive 2nd Team. Heading into the 2019-20 season, Green will see an increased role on offense without KD while also leading their defense as per usual.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF3: Joe Fulks (1946-54)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 1x NBA Champion, 2x All-Star, 3x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 16.4 PPG, 5.3 RPG, 1.2 APG

Not many people know Joe Fulks, but he was one of the NBA’s scorers in their first few seasons as well as the innovator of the modern jump shot. Fulks led the league in scoring in each of their first two seasons as he averaged 22.7 PPG throughout both seasons and even helped the Warriors win the first-ever league championship as Fulks averaged 26.2 PPG in five games against the now-defunct Chicago Stags. After averaging a career-high in points during the 1948-49 season with 26, Fulks started to go downhill over the next four seasons, and he averaged 14.9 PPG and 6.5 RPG during that span. He only averaged 2.5 PPG in his final season before retiring after the 1953-54 season. Even though he had a very bad FG% at just 30.9% (which wasn’t horrible during his time), he was one of the league’s first elite players.

&amp;#x200B;

**C1: Wilt Chamberlain (1959-65)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x NBA MVP, 6x All-Star, 1960 All-Star Game MVP, 1959-60 Rookie of the Year, 4x All-NBA 1st Team, 2x All-NBA 1st Team

Stats: 41.5 PPG, 25.1 RPG, 3 APG

Wilt Chamberlain was drafted in the 1959 NBA Draft by the Philadelphia Warriors with their territorial selection. That selection turned out to be a huge home run as he dominated in his rookie season as he averaged 37.6 PPG and 27 RPG, which led the league in both categories, en route to winning that year’s MVP. After averaging 38.4 PPG and 27.2 RPG in his second season, Wilt had one of the most dominant (although overrated to an extent) seasons of all-time as he averaged a whopping 50.4 PPG and 25.7 RPG, which included his famous 100-point game against the New York Knicks. After that season, Wilt continued his dominance over the next two seasons, with the Warriors now in San Francisco, as he averaged 40.8 PPG, 23.3 RPG, and 4.2 APG during that span which included an NBA Finals appearance in the latter of those two seasons. After averaging 38.9 PPG and 23.5 RPG in the first 38 games of the 1964-65 season, Wilt became disgruntled as the Warriors were losing a lot, and he was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers during that season.

&amp;#x200B;

**C2: Nate Thurmond (1963-74)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 7x All-Star, 2x All-Defensive 1st Team, 3x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 17.4 PPG, 16.9 RPG, 2.7 APG, 0.7 SPG, 2.9 BPG

Drafted third overall in the 1963 NBA Draft, Nate Thurmond was a solid big man in his rookie season as he averaged 7 PPG and 10.4 RPG while helping them reach the NBA Finals that year. However, Thurmond had a breakout season in his sophomore campaign, after the trade of Wilt Chamberlain, averaging 16.5 PPG and 18.1 RPG which helped him make his first All-Star team. Over the next eight seasons, Thurmond was one of the NBA’s best interior defenders and rebounders while also being a very good inside scorer as he averaged 19.5 PPG, 17.9 RPG, and 3.1 APG which garnered him five All-Star selections and four All-Defensive teams during that span. Thurmond averaged 13 PPG, 14.2 RPG, and 2.9 BPG en route to another All-Star and All-Defensive selection in his final season with the Warriors before he was traded before the 1974-75 season with the Chicago Bulls.

&amp;#x200B;

**C3: Neil Johnston (1951-59)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x NBA Champion, 6x All-Star, 4x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 19.4 PPG, 11.3 RPG, 2.5 APG

After signing with the Philadelphia Warriors before the 1951-52 season, Neil Johnston averaged 6 PPG and 5.3 RPG in his rookie season. However, Johnston broke out in his second season, averaging a league-leading 22.3 PPG and 13.9 RPG while shooting 45.2% from the field which resulted in a selection to the All-NBA 1st Team. Johnston remained one of the best scoring and rebounding big men over the next five seasons as he averaged 22.3 PPG and 12.4 RPG during that span while shooting 44.5% from the field while making an All-Star team in each of those seasons, and helping the Warriors win an NBA championship in 1956. Unfortunately, Johnston suffered a knee injury in the 1958 preseason, and he played in 28 games during the 1958-59 season while averaging 6.3 PPG and 5 RPG before retiring.

**TL;DR All-Time Warriors Roster**

**Analysis**

* This all-time team is probably one of the best all-around teams compared to the rest of them and is going to score a ton! With two of the greatest three-point shooters in Steph and Klay as well as two of the greatest scorers in KD and Wilt, good luck trying to defend this team. In addition, they also have the playmaking with Steph and an additional fifth really good all-around scorer in Rick Barry. The only weak link defensively in that starting five is Steph and with Klay's perimeter defense, Wilt's interior defense, and with both Barry and KD being very good all-around defensively, Steph's weaknesses on defense will not be as noticeable on this squad.
* That second unit is one of the best ones out there for an all-time team. Tim Hardaway was an excellent scorer and playmaker during his peak while Arizin and Mullin were both excellent scorers who could shoot from outside. While the guards and wings were mostly offensive guys, the frontcourt is the opposite as Thurmond is one of the greatest interior defenders and Draymond is an excellent all-around defender. In addition to Draymond's defense, Draymond is an all-around offensive player who is a really good playmaker and a dependable scorer (although he doesn't score a ton).

Thanks for reading this edition of the All-Time teams. The final all-time team will be the All-Time Raptors.

To do this, I compared each player's TS% to [The average TS% for that specific season, for that player's primary position](https://imgur.com/sxpH3RZ). Since I already had the data, I decided to also look at [the average amount of threes attempted by position](https://imgur.com/HdnYt9b) and [MPG by position](https://imgur.com/yVZS6mU).

To be considered a *mid/high-volume* scorer, you had to **play at least 60 games in a season and average at least 15PPG**. I considered raising the mid/high volume bar to 20PPG, but figured it would be interesting to see how some of the mid-tier scorers stacked up to the higher tier.

Anyways, I'll post the 50 most efficient seasons and the 50 most inefficient seasons in the last 40 years (an asterisk(\*) beside a player's name means they've been inducted into the hall of fame).

For the same reason that people say KD took away from Steph’s prime, I think that people will say the same about WB to Harden this upcoming year. He’ll play well, but I think their play styles will not fair out okay together considering both of their high usage rates. I think that the Rockets will benefit from having two MVPs on the court at the same time, but that the West is still extremely stacked and Westbrook will not perform well alongside Harden. I believe that the Rockets will fall anywhere from the 5th seed to the 8th seed. 

Along with that, I also believe that amongst all of the heavy MVP candidates such as Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Giannis, LeBron, etc., that Jokic will actually win it. I think that the Nuggets are going to run it back again, except with vast improvements from Murray and Jokic. If the Nuggets attain the top seed in the loaded Western Conference, I think that he’ll get the same Giannis narrative as last year and win the MVP award. 

I wouldn’t call both of my opinions unpopular, maybe more so unlikely, but I would like to hear about what people think that personally that others may not agree with. I think that an overall discussion about our predictions, thoughts, or opinions on the upcoming season would be a good insight to what to expect.

I'm not sure when LeBron became an underdog guy type of guy but are we really forgetting that he has taken teams with worse players to the finals? Last season James averaged 27, 8 &amp; 8 in only 55 games. He suffered an injury that later on caused him to be shutdown late in the season. The Lakers acquired AD in the offseason who is by far LeBron's best duo star. They also have a very good core of winning players/championship role players. And I think they would need AD to be just as healthy as LeBron. AD also isn't a very injury prone player, he just has very outlandish injuries. They have also signed Dwight Howard who played in 81 games and averaged 16 &amp; 12 just 2 seasons ago for the Hornets. They have multiple lineups, depth and height which teams like the Clippers who are favored over them lack. It's clear media is pushing for another MVP season for Giannis whom clearly robbed James Harden for MVP and completely boosted Khris Middleton's stock in the NBA (who contract is going to age like cheese on an outdoor Florida basketball court). Even with the Bucks leading the NBA in wins last season, the league is shaped differently and I don't see them competing with the stacked duo west or even beating the Philly Giants. Another team ranked heavily above the Lakers in many popular rankings such as [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27426015/nba-preseason-predictions-our-experts-picks-2019-20)'s  2019 NBA preseason predictions is the LA Clippers. Kawhi Leonard is coming off of a championship season with the right place right time Toronto Raptors. The Clippers didn't lose anyone in the addition of Kawhi but they also added Oklahoma City star Paul George. George averaged 28 8 &amp; 4 on 52% shooting from the field in the regular season. While George showcases his ability in regular season as perennial 2 way all star wing he seems to have a tough time having success in the playoffs. George hasn't made it out of the first round since 2014. He also struggles with staying healthy coming off surgery this offseason on both of his shoulders. Aside from the superstar talent on the wing the Clippers lack height and post defense. Their tallest player is Ivica Zubac standing at 7'1. Playing 17 minutes a game Zubac failed to average 1 block and only averaged 6 rebounds per game. While Montrezl Harrell is their defensive anchor he stands at only 6'10 and that could hurt them against some of the NBA most dominant bigs such as Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic and Joel Embiid. The Lakers seem to have it all this year from all star presence to championship mentality to veteran presence in the locker room.

Currently, the season runs from October to June with an 82 game schedule.   
Shortening the season would distort stats and have everyone lose money from players, sponsors, to ~~owners~~ Governors.   

I'd like to think there are better ways than load management to keep players healthy and showcase their talent when coming to another town as people pay to see them.  Also that the argument that players need to suck it up as they are high caliber athletes is a poor excuse as today's game is a lot more taxing on the body albeit less physical than the 90's.  However, are there solutions past this that could keep money in the pockets of everyone making money, but also prevent players from being burnt out?   

Personally, I'd start the season earlier and do away with exhibition and summer league games. Have rookies/players that need more playing time to go to the G-League if you don't believe they are ready for the league.   Stretch out the season from Mid September to Early July.  

Side note: I'd also love for playoffs to have all 30 teams with Single round elimination first round, best of 5 for the next 3 rounds, then last be best of 7.

**Head Coach: Don Nelson (1976-87)**

Accolades w/Team: 540-344 Regular Season Record, 42-46 Playoff Record

**Assistant Coach: Larry Costello (1968-76)**

Accolades w/Team: 410-264 Regular Season Record, 37-23 Playoff Record, 2 Finals Appearances, 1x NBA Champion

**Assistant Coach: George Karl (1998-03)**

Accolades w/Team: 205-173 Regular Season Record, 14-18 Playoff Record

&amp;#x200B;

**PG1: Oscar Robertson (1970-74)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 1x NBA Champion, 2x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 16.3 PPG, 4.9 RPG, 7.5 APG, 1.1 SPG, 0.1 BPG

The Milwaukee Bucks acquired Oscar Robertson in a trade after the 1969-70 season, and it turned out to be a huge trade for the franchise. Robertson averaged 19.4 PPG, 5.7 RPG, and 8.2 APG during his first season in Milwaukee which earned him a selection on the All-NBA 2nd Team and helped the Bucks win their first and only NBA championship despite only being in their third season as the Big O averaged 23.5 PPG, 5 RPG, and 9.5 APG in four NBA Finals games against the Baltimore Bullets. Robertson continued to start at point guard for the contending Bucks over the next three seasons as he averaged 15.1 PPG, 4.6 RPG, and 7.2 APG during that span. Robertson was very valuable to the Bucks as he helped lead them to four division titles in all four of his seasons with them, and they missed the playoffs in the seasons after he retired.

&amp;#x200B;

**PG2: Sam Cassell (1999-03)**

Stats: 19 PPG, 4 RPG, 7.2 APG, 1.2 SPG, 0.1 BPG

The Bucks acquired Sam Cassell during the 1999 lockout season in a three-team deal that involved the Timberwolves and the Nets. He didn’t do much for them during that season as he played in just four games while averaging 13.8 PPG and 4.3 APG. However, Cassell bounced back in his first full season in Milwaukee as he averaged 18.6 PPG, 3.7 RPG, and 9 APG. Over the next three seasons, Cassell continued to be the starting point guard for the Bucks, and he was important to the team as he averaged 19.2 PPG, 4.1 RPG, and 6.7 APG during that span which included an appearance in the Eastern Conference Finals in 2001. However, the Bucks traded Cassell to the Timberwolves after the 2002-03 season.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG1: Sidney Moncrief (1979-89)**

Accolades w/Team: 5x All-Star, 2x Defensive Player of the Year, 1x All-NBA 1st Team, 4x All-NBA 2nd Team, 4x All-Defensive 1st Team, 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 16.7 PPG, 5 RPG, 3.9 APG, 1.3 SPG, 0.3 BPG

Drafted fifth overall by the Milwaukee Bucks in the NBA Draft, Sidney Moncrief was a solid player for the franchise during his first two seasons as he averaged 11.3 PPG, 4.7 RPG, and 2.5 APG during that span. However, Sid the Squid broke out in his third season as he averaged 19.8 PPG, 6.7 RPG, and 4.8 APG en route to his first All-NBA selection as well as a selection to the All-Defensive 2nd Team. Moncrief continued to be one of the best guards in the NBA on both ends of the court over the next four seasons as he averaged 21.3 PPG, 5.6 RPG, 4.6 APG, and 1.5 SPG during that span while making an All-NBA team and All-Defensive 1st Team in each of those seasons as well as winning the first two ever Defensive Player of the Year awards. However, knee and foot injuries caught up to Moncrief as he slowed down in his final three seasons as he averaged 11.6 PPG, 3.1 RPG, and 3.3 APG during that span before retiring after the 1988-89 season.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG2: Ray Allen (1996-03)**

Accolades w/Team: 3x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 19.6 PPG, 4.6 RPG, 3.8 APG, 1.3 SPG, 0.2 BPG

Drafted fifth overall in the 1996 NBA draft, Ray Allen had a solid rookie season as the Bucks’ starting shooting guard as he averaged 13.4 PPG, 4 RPG, and 2.6 APG. After that rookie year, Jesus Shuttlesworth improved over his next two seasons as he averaged 18.6 PPG, 4.7 RPG, and 4 APG during that span. However, Allen made the All-Star team in each of the next three seasons while changing his game from primarily a slasher to a sharpshooter as he averaged 22 PPG, 4.7 RPG, and 4.1 APG during that span while shooting 43% from three-point range with a total of 603 three-pointers made over those three seasons, which was the most from 1999-2002. He also led the Bucks to the Eastern Conference Finals during the 2000-01 season. After averaging 21.3 PPG, 4.6 RPG, and 3.5 APG in the first 47 games of the 2002-03 season with the Bucks, Ray Allen was traded to the Seattle Supersonics during that season.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG3: Michael Redd (2000-11)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 20 PPG, 4 RPG, 2.3 APG, 1 SPG, 0.1 BPG

Michael Redd turned out to the best draft pick in the lackluster 2000 NBA Draft despite being drafted with the 43rd overall pick. He only played in 6 games in his rookie season, but he improved over the next two seasons as he averaged 13.5 PPG and 4 RPG while coming off the bench for a majority of those games. However, Redd had a huge breakout year in the 2003-04 season as he averaged 21.7 PPG, 5 RPG, and 2.3 APG en route to his first All-Star selection as well as a selection to the All-NBA 3rd Team. Redd never made the All-Star team again, but he improved his scoring over the next three seasons as he averaged 24.8 PPG, 4.1 RPG, and 2.5 APG during that span which included averaging 26.7 PPG in the 2006-07 season. He averaged 22.2 PPG, 4 RPG, and 3.2 APG over the next two seasons. Unfortunately, during the latter of those two seasons, Redd tore his left ACL and MCL after 32 games. He was never the same player as he played in just 28 more games with the Bucks before signing with the Suns for the 2011-12 season.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG4: Brian Winters (1975-83)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star

Stats: 16.7 PPG, 2.7 RPG, 4.3 APG, 1.2 SPG, 0.3 BPG

After his rookie season with the L.A. Lakers, Brian Winters was traded, with a few other players, to the Milwaukee Bucks for Hall of Fame center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. He was really good in his first season with the team as he averaged 18.2 PPG, 3.2 RPG, and 4.7 APG en route to his first All-Star selection. Over the next three seasons, the 6’4” shooting guard averaged 19.7 PPG, 2.8 RPG, and 4.7 APG during that span while making his second All-Star team in the latter of those three seasons. After averaging 13.7 PPG, 2.4 RPG, and 3.7 APG in his final four seasons, Winters retired after the 1982-83 season. Speaking of Brian Winters, the one and only Michael Jordan called him the best pure shooter of all-time in 2005 due to his beautiful stroke.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF1: Marques Johnson (1977-84)**

Accolades w/Team: 4x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 1st Team, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 21 PPG, 7.5 RPG, 3.7 APG, 1.3 SPG, 0.8 BPG

Drafted third overall by the Milwaukee Bucks in the 1977 NBA Draft, Marques Johnson was a really good player in his rookie season as he averaged 19.5 PPG, 10.6 RPG, and 2.4 APG. Although he never averaged that many rebounds again, he improved a lot in his sophomore season as he averaged 25.6 PPG, 7.6 RPG, and 3 APG on 55% shooting en route to a selection on the All-NBA 1st Team. Marques Johnson continued to be an excellent scorer over the next five seasons as he averaged 20.3 PPG, 6.8 RPG, and 4.1 APG during that span while shooting 52.6% from the field which resulted in an All-Star selection in three of those five seasons as well as two more All-NBA selections. Although his scoring was off the charts, even as he slowly became the second option to Sidney Moncrief, Johnson was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers before the 1984-85 season for power forward Terry Cummings.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF2: Bob Dandridge (1969-77, 1981)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 1x NBA Champion, 3x All-Star

Stats: 18.6 PPG, 7.3 RPG, 3.2 APG, 1.5 SPG, 0.5 BPG

Although Bob Dandridge was drafted in the fourth round of the 1969 NBA Draft, he turned out to be a great pick for the Bucks as he averaged 13.2 PPG, 7.7 RPG, and 3.6 APG in his rookie season. Dandridge improved over the next two seasons as he averaged 18.4 PPG, 7.8 RPG, and 3.3 APG during that span while helping win a championship in the first of those two seasons as he averaged 20.3 PPG, 9.8 RPG, and 3.5 APG in four NBA Finals games against the Baltimore Bullets. Over the next five seasons after the 1971-72 season, Dandridge averaged 20.3 PPG, 7.1 RPG, and 3.1 APG during that span which earned him an All-Star selection in three of those seasons. After the 1976-77 season, Dandridge signed with the Bullets, now in Washington D.C. during the 1977 offseason, but he returned to the Bucks for 11 games in the 1981-82 season before retiring.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF3: Glenn Robinson (1994-02)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star

Stats: 21.1 PPG, 6.2 RPG, 2.8 APG, 1.2 SPG, 0.6 BPG

Drafted first overall by the Milwaukee Bucks in the 1994 NBA Draft, Glenn Robinson was a really good player in his first four seasons despite not making a single All-Star team in that span as he averaged 21.5 PPG, 6.1 RPG, and 3 APG during that span. After averaging 18.4 PPG and 5.9 RPG in the shortened 1999 season while helping the Bucks make the playoffs for the first time since he arrived, Big Dog was selected to the All-Star team in each of the next two seasons as he averaged 21.4 PPG, 6.4 RPG, and 2.8 APG during that span which included an Eastern Conference Finals appearance in the latter of those two seasons. After another really good 2001-02 season with the Bucks as he averaged 20.7 PPG and 6.2 RPG, Robinson was traded to the Atlanta Hawks during the 2002 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF4: Paul Pressey (1982-90)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Defensive 1st Team, 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 11.9 PPG, 4.3 RPG, 5.6 APG, 1.5 SPG, 0.6 BPG

Paul Pressey helped revolutionize the point forward position during his eight seasons with the Milwaukee Bucks. Pressey averaged 7.5 PPG, 3.5 RPG, and 2.9 APG over his first two seasons, but he improved in his third one as he averaged 16.1 PPG, 5.4 RPG, and 6.8 APG while making the All-Defensive 1st Team as well. Pressey’s scoring decreased a bit over his next four seasons, but he was still an excellent floor general as he averaged 13.4 PPG, 4.7 RPG, 7.2 APG, and 1.8 SPG during that span while being selected to an additional two All-Defensive teams in both 1986 and 1987. After coming off the bench in the 1989-90 season as he averaged 11 PPG, 3 RPG, and 4.3 APG, Pressey was traded to the San Antonio Spurs during the 1990 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF1: Giannis Antetokounmpo (2013-)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x NBA MVP, 3x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 1st Team, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-Defensive 1st Team, 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 18.8 PPG, 8.3 RPG, 4.1 APG, 1.2 SPG, 1.3 BPG

Drafted 15th overall by the Bucks in the 2013 NBA Draft, Giannis Antetokounmpo has improved in each of his six seasons with the franchise. Giannis was a solid and promising player over his first three seasons as he averaged 12.2 PPG, 6.3 RPG, and 2.9 APG during that span while playing at three (or four) different positions. Giannis’s breakout season would come in the 2016-17 season as he averaged 22.9 PPG, 88 RPG, 5.4 APG, 1.6 SPG, and 1.9 BPG which got him a selection on the All-NBA 2nd Team as well as that year’s Most Improved Player. Giannis followed up that campaign with an even better 2017-18 season as he averaged 26.9 PPG, 10 RPG, 4.8 APG, 1.5 SPG, and 1.4 BPG en route to his second All-NBA 2nd Team selection. It doesn’t stop there for the Greek Freak as he was even better in this past season as he averaged 27.7 PPG, 12.5 RPG, 5.9 APG, 1.3 SPG, and 1.5 BPG in 32.8 MPG while leading the Bucks to the NBA’s record which garnered him an All-NBA 1st Team selection as well as this past year’s MVP award. Heading into the 2019-20 season, Giannis looks to improve even more and could potentially help the Bucks win their first NBA championship since 1971 after he led them to the Conference Finals in this past postseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF2: Terry Cummings (1984-89, 1995-96)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 19.4 PPG, 7.8 RPG, 2.3 APG, 1.3 SPG, 0.7 BPG

Terry Cummings was acquired by the Milwaukee Bucks before the 1984-85 season for former Bucks All-Star Marques Johnson and was really good in his first season with the franchise as he averaged 23.6 PPG and 9.1 RPG which helped him make the All-Star team and the All-NBA 2nd Team. After averaging 20.6 PPG and 8.1 RPG over the next three seasons, Cummings returned to the All-Star team in the 1988-89 season as he averaged 22.9 PPG and 8.1 RPG which also resulted in a selection to the All-NBA 3rd Team. Despite an excellent 1988-89 season, he was traded after that season to the San Antonio Spurs. He returned to the Bucks for an uneventful 1995-96 season where he averaged 8 PPG and 5.5 RPG off the bench before signing with the Sonics for the next season.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF3: Vin Baker (1993-97)**

Accolades w/Team: 3x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 18.3 PPG, 9.5 RPG, 2.7 APG, 0.9 SPG, 1.3 BPG

Drafted eighth overall in the 1993 NBA Draft, Vin Baker was solid in his rookie season as he averaged 13.5 PPG and 7.6 RPG. However, Baker moved from center to power forward in his second season which caused him to improve and average 17.7 PPG, 10.3 RPG, and 3.6 APG which got him selected to the All-Star team for the first time. Vin Baker saw even more improvement over the next two seasons as he averaged 21 PPG, 10.1 RPG, and 2.6 APG during that span which got him two more All-Star selections as well as his first All-NBA selection in the 1996-97 season. Despite Baker’s excellent play, the Bucks never made the playoffs in his four years there and he was traded to the Sonics before the 1997-98 season.

**C1: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1969-75)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 1x NBA Champion, 1x Finals MVP, 3x NBA MVP, 6x All-Star, 1969-70 Rookie of the Year, 4x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 2x All-Defensive 1st Team, 2x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 30.4 PPG, 15.3 RPG, 4.3 APG, 1.2 SPG, 3.4 BPG

After an accomplished four seasons at UCLA where he won three national championships, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, then known as Lew Alcindor, was drafted first overall by the Milwaukee Bucks in the 1969 NBA Draft. He thrived in his rookie season as he averaged 28.8 PPG, 14.5 RPG, and 4.1 APG while making the All-NBA 2nd Team and winning that year’s Rookie of the Year as helped the Bucks win 56 games despite playing in just their second season. The next season was even better for Kareem as he averaged 31.7 PPG, 16 RPG, and 3.3 APG while winning the regular season MVP and helping the Bucks win their first championship in just their third season as he won Finals MVP by averaging 27 PPG, 18.5 RPG, and 2.8 APG in four NBA Finals games against the Baltimore Bullets. Kareem continued to be the most dominant center in the league for the Bucks over the next four seasons as he averaged 30.5 PPG, 15.4 RPG, 4.6 APG, 1.2 SPG, and 3.4 BPG during that span which helped him win two more MVPs in Milwaukee and helped the Bucks reach the NBA Finals again in 1974. However, without point guard Oscar Robertson, the Bucks fell to 38 wins in the 1974-75 season, and a disgruntled Abdul-Jabbar was traded to the Lakers after that season after he demanded a trade.

&amp;#x200B;

**C2: Bob Lanier (1980-84)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star

Stats: 13.5 PPG, 5.9 RPG, 2.7 APG, 1 SPG, 0.9 BPG

Bob Lanier was acquired by the Milwaukee Bucks in a trade during the 1979-80 season after nine-and-a-half excellent seasons with the Detroit Pistons. Lanier averaged 15.7 PPG and 6.9 RPG in 26 games for the Bucks that season as he sacrificed his stats for the benefit of the Bucks as he helped them to a 20-6 record during the games he played for them. Lanier averaged 13.3 PPG, 5.8 RPG, and 2.7 APG over the final four seasons while playing a lesser role than he did in Detroit, but he was still selected to an All-Star game with the Bucks. Lanier would retire after the 1983-84 season where he put up 13.6 PPG and 6.3 RPG.

**TL;DR All-Time Bucks Roster**

||Starters|Reserves|
|:-|:-|:-|
|PG|**Oscar Robertson**|Sam Cassell|
|SG|**Sidney Moncrief**|Ray Allen, Michael Redd, Brian Winters|
|SF|**Marques Johnson**|Bob Dandridge, Glenn Robinson, Paul Pressey|
|PF|**Giannis Antetokounmpo**|Terry Cummings, Vin Baker|
|C|**Kareem Abdul-Jabbar**|Bob Lanier|
||*Head Coach*|*Assistant Coaches*|
|Coaching Staff|Don Nelson|Larry Costello, George Karl|

**Analysis**

* The All-Time Bucks starting lineup is one of the better starting lineups for an All-Time team. There are no weak links offensively as Oscar and Moncrief were both excellent playmakers, and all five of these guys in the starting five could score. Kareem and Giannis will wreak havoc inside with the former's sky hook that was very hard to guard as well as the Greek Freak's ability to drive and dunk on opponents. Don't forget about Giannis's playmaking as well as Oscar and Sid's scoring either. Also, Marques Johnson was one of the best scorers during the best seasons in the NBA. This starting lineup has some really good defensive pieces with Giannis, Kareem, and Moncrief.
* In the second unit, Sam Cassell and Bob Lanier don't stand out that much, but they were team players that will get the other bench guys going. Cassell was a very good playmaker and scorer and Lanier was very good at scoring inside. The best guys off the bench are sharpshooting and slashing Ray Allen as well as solid inside presence Terry Cummings and solid all-around scorer Bob Dandridge who also was very good at defense and rebounding.

Before coming to the Lakers, DMC signed on with the Lakers for a 1-year $5M contract, exactly the time and money he signed with the Golden State Warriors last season due to various injuries ranging from Torn Achilles Tendon (New Orleans), to a torn quadriceps (Golden State) and now a Torn ACL (L.A. Lakers).

As a result of DMC being set to miss the entire 2019-20 season to a Torn ACL, the Lakers signed Dwight Howard once the Memphis Grizzlies bought him out of the contract that he signed with the Washington Wizards. It is said to be a non-guaranteed one year contract where the Lakers could cut him at any time for injuries or for his attitude, and while it may be a little too early to assume that the Lakers will never cut Dwight loose now, just because of DMC's injuries and legal issues, I have a feeling the Lakers have wasted a roster spot worth $5M on a center that wouldn't be playing and may never wear their team uniform anyway. Lakers' management said they're not cutting him, however they could change their mind and cut him loose down the line.

If the Lakers released him, then DeMarcus Cousins' roster spot would've been used to sign Andre Iguodala or Carmelo Anthony, and I wouldn't be surprised to see Royce White happy if Melo signs with the Lakers, given the recent Royce White interview was over Royce ranting about how BIG3 is better than the NBA, feeling wronged by David Stern and Adam Silver, how LeBron James left his Banana Boat personal ally (Melo) high and dry in favor of signing Jared Dudley, based on who fits the LeBron-era Lakers better.",True,False,,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,64437,public,self,Is it fair to assume that Dwight Howard will never be cut by the L.A.

Despite Chris Paul being on the tail-end of his career, he can push Orlando to the top 4-5 in the East and possibly help them make some noise. Magic have a decent young core and can rely on internal development for the remainder of his deal. The Magic will probably not even make the ECF, but going all in for CP3 can help revenue and grow the fanbase since Orlando will become a decent squad.

A proposed trade would be CP3 for Fournier, Augustin and possibly a guy like TRoss/Aminu/Fultz after the December 15 trade date for newly signed FAs. Thunder would probably have to throw in a pick but the CP3 trade allows them to hand the keys of the franchise to SGA and develop him to his max potential.

I've really enjoyed doing this series so far that I'm calling ***Basketball, Stat!*** And hopefully you've enjoyed it as well. In case you missed the first two posts, I'm doing a series that deep dives into different advanced stats that are used as all-in-one measures of player performance. Previously I looked at [**PER**](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cmrkv3/basketball_stat_player_efficiency_rating_per/) and [**RAPM**](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cpstmo/basketball_stat_regularized_adjusted_plusminus/), and this week we'll be looking at **Box Plus/Minus**, or **BPM**.

In addition to these, I'm also doing a[ podcast series](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/basketball-stat/id1477084574) by the same name that summarizes and discusses what I'm breaking down here. I won't go through all the nuts and bolts in the pod, but check it out if you want a slightly higher level version.

But with that, let's get into the breakdown of BPM!

&amp;#x200B;

# The Basics

Despite its name, **Box Plus/Minus** is not really in the same family of Plus/Minus stats that we looked at with simple **Plus/Minus**, **APM**, and **RAPM**. These Plus/Minus stats generally have simple Plus/Minus at the heart of them, whereas BPM is a stat derived from a player's box score stats, such as points, rebounds, and assists, combined with team performance. Perhaps the best way to explain the difference is this: APM and RAPM use the team's performance depending on players on the court to find a player's value, but BPM uses RAPM to find the value of box score stats, and then translates that into player value.

BPM was created by **Dan Myers**, and one of the interesting choices he made in the creation of the stat was to intentionally limit it to stats that were tracked as of  the 1973-74 season. His[ article](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/bpm.html) about the stat on Basketball Reference suggests that he could have improved the accuracy of the stat had he not made this choice, but he prioritized something that could be historically useful over improved accuracy.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Foundation

BPM is closely akin to a stat called **Statistical Plus/Minus (SPM)**, which we should probably discuss first. If you recall from our breakdown of RAPM, **Dan Rosenbaum** didn't stop once he found **Pure APM**. He recognized that the stat was noisy and had too much statistical error, so he continued to tinker with it in his[ definitive article](http://www.82games.com/comm30.htm) on the stat. (Here's a one-sentence refresh on APM: A play-by-play linear regression is run on the margin of stints of play to solve for player coefficients that equate to each player's Pure APM.)

So from here, Dan runs another regression, but this time, rather than finding the values for each  player, he's looking for the value of the standard box score stats. He sets Pure APM equal to an equation that consists of box score stats multiplied by coefficients. He then solves for these coefficients that set the value for each box score stat, such as points per 40 minutes, DRB per 40 minutes, ORB per 40 minutes, 3PA per 40 minutes, etc. He uses 14 of these stats in total, and solves for the coefficient for each of them. So rather than relying on APM to dictate player value, he uses APM to assign values to box score stats.  He then applies those values to each player's box score stats to calculate SPM, where he found a much smaller standard error compared to APM.

So how does SPM relate to BPM? BPM is a variation of SPM that uses advanced box score stats wherever possible. For example, where SPM used DRB per 40 minutes, BPM uses DRBD% instead. In addition, BPM’s statistical regression is built using RAPM values rather than APM, and RAPM has proven to be a much more reliable measurement than APM (If you're unfamiliar with RAPM vs APM, please refer to[ my previous article](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cpstmo/basketball_stat_regularized_adjusted_plusminus/)). Essentially, BPM is an improvement on almost every aspect of SPM.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Formula

So let's talk about exactly what all goes into BPM! There is a simple formula that we can just plug numbers into and generate a BPM number, but if you've been following along, the purpose of this is to understand the ""why"" of the formula. So we’ll get there, but let's talk about what BPM is made of first.

As with SPM, the formula for BPM is going to consist of coefficients that are multiplied by players' box score stats, and that will give us BPM. But what are these coefficients and where do they come from? We start with RAPM. Dan Myers used a 14-year RAPM sample from **Jeremias Engelmann** and used 961 players from that sample. These 961 players were the highest ""weighted"" players in the sample, meaning they played a substantial amount of possessions as to not negatively impact the model.

For these 961 RAPM numbers spread over a 14-year period, Dan then tested many different iterations of different combinations of advanced statistics to find the combination that provided the least error in his regression. He then set all of these advanced stats and their coefficients equal to the various RAPM values and ran the regression, looking at the error compared to the 14-year RAPM sample. In the end, he settled on a combination of statistics that satisfied a few things: 1) low error, 2) a reasonable amount of variables (not a crazy, 50-term equation), and 3) few logical nonlinear terms. So with that understanding, let's look at the equation that Myers gives us:

&amp;#x200B;

Raw BPM = a\*ReMPG + b\*ORB% + c\*DRB% + d\*STL% + e\*BLK% + f\*AST% - g\*USG%\*TO% + h\*USG%\*(1-TOV%)\*\[2\*(TS% - TmTS%) + i\*AST% + j\*(3PAr - Lg3PAr) - k\] + l\*sqrt(AST%\*TRB%)

&amp;#x200B;

So now that we see all stats he settled on, let's go ahead and define them (and note that a-l are all coefficients that he gives value to, and we'll look at those values later):

* ReMPG = Regressed Minutes per Game (a slightly altered MPG to avoid instances where a player plays very few games but with high minutes per game)
* ORB% = Offensive rebounds divided by offensive rebounding opportunities
* DRB% = Defensive rebounds divided by defensive rebounding opportunities
* STL% = Steals divided by number of opponent possessions while player is on the floor
* BLK% = Blocks divided by number of 2-point FGA while player is on the floor
* AST% = Assists divided by teammate FGs (so excluding FGs made by the player)
* USG% = Number of possessions ""used"" by a player divided by number of possessions while he's on the court (“used” meaning ends in a shot attempt, free throws, or turnover by the player)
* TOV% = Turnovers divided by possessions ""used"" by the player
* TS% = Points / ( 2 \* TSA) where TSA = True Shooting Attempts (FG + 0.44 \* FTA)
* TmTS% = Team's true shooting (same as immediately previous formula, but for entire team instead of the player)
* 3PAr = 3PA / FGA
* Lg3PAr = 3PA / FGA (for entire league)
* TRB% = Total rebounds divided by total rebounding opportunities

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, now let's take a look at what each of these terms is doing. And let me say up front that Myers explains this best in his Basketball Reference article that I mentioned earlier, but for my own sake at least, I'm going to walk through it myself as well.

&amp;#x200B;

ReMPG, ORB%, DRB%, STL%, BLK%, and AST% are all very straightforward, linear terms. Those terms are individually multiplied by their corresponding coefficients to add in to the player’s overall value. And remember that we're using ""advanced"" stats here, so everything is possession or rate based. But a few notes on some specific stats here:

* The fact that MPG was factored in is an interesting tidbit on its own. Myers found that including it improved the accuracy of BPM, and he accounts for it by noting two things: 1) Coaches often know more and give better players more playing time, even if it's for reasons that stats or the general public can't see and 2) it serves as an indicator for strength of opponent, meaning that higher minute players are likely facing stronger competition.
* STL% and BLK% are simple, linear terms that only appear here.
* ORB% and DRB% are also simple, linear terms, but note that TRB% appears later in the equation, so these will ultimately impact each other to completely account for rebounding.
* AST% makes several appearances throughout the formula, so this AST% term is merely an adjustment to more accurately measure the value of AST%.

&amp;#x200B;

USG%\*TOV% is our first multi-variable term, but it equals out to turnovers committed by the player divided by possessions that he's on the court, which is still a simple, linear term.

&amp;#x200B;

Our next term, which is Myers' scoring term, starts to get very interesting. Let's look at it as a whole first, then break it down: h\*USG%\*(1-TOV%)\*\[2\*(TS% - TmTS%) + i\*AST% + j\*(3PAr - Lg3PAr) - k\]

* USG%\*(1-TOV%) can be translated as, ""Shooting USG%."" It is the percentage of the team's possessions in which the player is shooting, in other words, USG% with turnovers factored out. He multiplies this by the entire following scoring term.
* 2\*(TS% - TmTS%) accomplishes a couple things: 1) it translates TS% and TmTS% into points per shooting possession by multiplying by two, and 2) it compares the player's TS% to the team's average TS% (average without the player). So if our player has a higher TS% than his team's average without him, this is a positive term. If it's lower, it's a negative term, which makes sense, as his less efficient shots would theoretically be hurting his team, since they would otherwise get a higher efficiency shot had the player not taken the less efficient shots.
* AST% is factored in again here, which is interesting considering Myers referred to this as a scoring stat. But he explains that a player's assists are worth more if he's also contributing to scoring, which is why it's factored in here.
* 3PAr - Lg3PAr is considering whether the player is shooting threes more often than the league average. Given that we already factored in TS% and that this is the rate of 3PA and not a scoring stat, this is accounting for the value of stretching the floor. I absolutely love that he does this! Spacing is an extremely valuable factor on offensive and this was one of the first (if not **the** first) advanced all-in-one stat to account for this.
* And finally, k is a constant that we'll give value to shortly.

&amp;#x200B;

And that brings us to our last term: sqrt(AST%\*TRB%). I love the way Myers explains this stat, so I'll just share what he wrote about it:

&gt;Finally, a positive interaction term between rebounding and assists is included. This can be interpreted a number of ways – athleticism interacting with basketball awareness, size interacting with basketball skills, etc. This term was highly significant, and helped the overall fit of the regression quite a bit. Using the square root of the interaction both makes sense theoretically (maintaining a denominator of opportunities or possessions) and empirically (it is more significant and helps the overall fit of the regression more).

And that gives us our Raw BPM! Afterwards, he adjusts at the team level, and we will get there in a second, but let's first look at the value of the coefficients.

&amp;#x200B;

|Coeff.|Term|BPM Value|Variable Format|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|a|Regr.MPG|0.123391|48.0|
|b|ORB%|0.119597|100.0|
|c|DRB%|\-0.151287|100.0|
|d|STL%|1.255644|100.0|
|e|BLK%|0.531838|100.0|
|f|AST%|\-0.305868|100.0|
|g|TO%\*USG%|0.921292|.000\*100.0|
|h|Scoring|0.711217||
||USG%||100.0|
||TO%||.000|
||TS% &amp; TmTS%||.000|
|i |AST Interaction|0.017022|100.0|
|j | 3PAr Interaction|0.297639|.000|
|k | Threshold Scoring|0.213485||
|l|sqrt(AST%\*TRB%)|0.725930|100.0\*100.0|

&amp;#x200B;

A quick note on two coefficients: AST% and DRB%. You'll notice they're both negative, and that might leave you scratching your head as to why, considering those are positive contributions. Remember that AST% is factored in multiple places, and the latter positive terms outweigh the initial negative. The same is true for DRB% when you look at TRB% factored in at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

So with that, let's look at the team adjustment that Myers makes:

BPM\_Team\_Adjustment = \[Team\_Rating\*120% - S(Player\_%Min\*Player\_RawBPM)\]/5

&amp;#x200B;

There's really two big terms at work here:

* The Team\_Rating term is the net rating of the team, adjusted for strength of schedule.
* S(Player\_%Min\*Player\_RawBPM) is the total of a team's player's Raw BPMs, but adjusted for the percentage of minutes played. So if a player has a Raw BPM of 20, but played 10% of the team's overall minutes, his value here is going to be two. Then you add in that value for each player on the team.

&amp;#x200B;

Once you have the BPM\_Team\_Adjustment for a team, that number is then added to every player's Raw BPM on that team. So let's say we have a Team\_Rating of +10, and the minute-weighted sum of the players' Raw BPM on the team is +6, that would give us an equation of BPM\_Team\_Adjustment = \[10\*1.2 - 6\]/5 = 1.2. We would then add 1.2 to every player's Raw BPM that's on the team we just looked at.

Let's take a slight detour to talk about the 120% number, because it stands out here as a somewhat arbitrary number at first. When watching a game where a good team falls behind, you may often find yourself assuming that the trailing team is going to make a comeback. It seems like it happens all of the time. Well, Jeremias Engelmann did a study and found that assumption to be well-based! He found that teams that are usually ahead are generally 20% better than their final results indicate. Conversely, teams that are usually trailing are generally 20% worse than their results. So this 120% accounts for that fact.

&amp;#x200B;

And that is how BPM is calculated! But there's one other thing we can do here if we want to go a step further. Myers' RAPM dataset from Engelmann had both ORAPM and DRAPM, so he ran another regression just for ORAPM to get another set of coefficients. So you can take the same Raw BPM formula, and use a separate set of coefficients to solve for OBPM. Here are the OBPM coefficients:

&amp;#x200B;

|Coeff.|Term|OBPM Value|Variable Format|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|a|Regr.MPG|0.064448|48.0|
|b|ORB%|0.211125|100.0|
|c|DRB%|\-0.107545|100.0|
|d|STL%|0.346513|100.0|
|e|BLK%|\-0.052476|100.0|
|f|AST%|\-0.041787|100.0|
|g|TO%\*USG%|0.932965|.000\*100.0|
|h|Scoring|0.687359||
||USG%||100.0|
||TO%||.000|
||TS% &amp; TmTS%||.000|
|i |AST Interaction|0.007952|100.0|
|j | 3PAr Interaction|0.374706|.000|
|k | Threshold Scoring|\-0.181891||
|l|sqrt(AST%\*TRB%)|0.239862|100.0\*100.0|

&amp;#x200B;

From there, you perform the same team adjustment to find OBPM. Then, DBPM is simply equal to BPM - OBPM. And now we're **really** finished with the formula!

&amp;#x200B;

# Bonus Round! - Value Over Replacement Player

As we mentioned in the beginning, even though BPM uses MPG as part of the formula, it is a per 100 possessions based stat, so it doesn't account for playing time. However, Myers doesn't leave us hanging! He also presents us with another step we can take in calculating **Value Over Replacement Player**, or **VORP**.

&amp;#x200B;

VORP = \[BPM – (-2.0)\] \* (% of minutes played)\*(team games/82)

&amp;#x200B;

VORP is supposed to measure how many points per 100 possessions a player is valued at over an average player at that position. It's a good approximation for how much value a player is providing to his team during a season, and it's a number that you can compare linearly. As Myers points out, a player with a VORP of 4.0 contributed twice as much to his team compared to a player with a VORP of 2.0.

&amp;#x200B;

# Historical Examples

Given that BPM is still a box score based stat, I wanted to do something similar to what we looked at with PER. So let's first take a look at the[ top 100 BPM seasons since the 1973-74, with a minimum of 40 games played](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;type=totals&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;per_poss_base=100&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;year_min=1974&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=0&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=g&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=40&amp;order_by=bpm).

The top 10 looks really good. There are multiple LeBron and Jordan seasons, which is usually a good sign at the top. Westbrook, Curry, Harden, and interestingly Chris Paul round out the rest of the top 10 seasons. Overall, I think this is a great representation. All of these individual seasons were some of the most incredible regular season performances of all time. The Chris Paul season is probably the one that most people would take issue with, but in general, I think this is a good list.

When we expand to the top 100 however, we start to see some cracks. Similarly to PER, we have no sign of Stockton or Nash in the top 100. I don't believe that alone is a deal-breaker, but when you consider there are four Westbrook seasons and five Chris Paul seasons in the top 100, having Stockton and Nash missing seems to be an issue. At least we have Magic here this time, so not all is lost!

&amp;#x200B;

With PER, we saw defensive players severely underrated. Myers told us up front that he believe BPM doesn't accurately reflect defensive contribution, but I expect DBPM to do a much better job than PER. So let's take a look at[ DRPM historically](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;per_poss_base=100&amp;type=advanced&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;year_min=1974&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=0&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=g&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=40&amp;order_by=dbpm).

The top 10 is...interesting. We have some very great signs though, with Ben Wallace and Marcus Camby having multiple appearances. There's no way we would expect either of them to appear in the top anything for PER, but they're clearly elite defensive players, and DBPM captures that. However, the rest of the list is a little more suspect with Ekpe Udoh and Greg Stiemsma both making appearances.

The rest of the top 100 has some notable absences, such as Kawhi, Bruce Bowen, Rodman, and Pippen, while Shawn Bradley and Myles Turner both make appearances. Myers mentioned that DRPM tended to favor big men, and that seems to clearly be the case here.

&amp;#x200B;

# Strengths and Weaknesses

Overall, going through this exercise gave me a new respect for BPM. I was aware of its defensive deficiencies beforehand, but the method by which Myers created BPM was extremely well thought out and well tested. It truly is an enormous advancement for box-score-based stats. While it's not a true successor of PER, it's a better alternative in almost every respect.

Still, BPM suffers from the common box score stat deficiencies, namely defense. It absolutely is an improvement over prior box score based statistics as it captures, if not overstates, big man defense. This is a big step forward, but perimeter defense still seems to be largely undervalued here.

We also see some of the assist-first guards undervalued, such as Nash and Stockton. Even though Magic had multiple top 100 seasons, BPM tended to favor Westbrook-type play comparatively, and most basketball minds would argue Magic was a much better player.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion

As I mentioned above, I have a renewed respect for BPM after doing this exercise. As an overall stat, it's useful to look at and should definitely take precedent over PER. I even think it's valuable to compare players using BPM, particularly when converting to VORP in a season. But big men will be overrated on defense, and pass-first guards will be seemingly underrated. Still, BPM was an enormous advancement on box score stats!",True,False,,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,64352,public,self,"Basketball, Stat: Box Plus/Minus (BPM)",0,1566914632,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cvoiq9/basketball_stat_box_plusminus_bpm/,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'haeBcK__Uj_Izn6TScS_MVyNc4hOpXCMsTc0UeXnIKM', 'resolutions': [{'height': 56, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/jRlptExJiswfKDmTbPUtGpIyoE4QAculJxXFcKtFezQ.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=892ecbed686668683eae696fc41720505c86776a', 'width': 108}, {'height': 113, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/jRlptExJiswfKDmTbPUtGpIyoE4QAculJxXFcKtFezQ.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58b755d09e41f624a30f7e1cae12f8cb02afb551', 'width': 216}, {'height': 168, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/jRlptExJiswfKDmTbPUtGpIyoE4QAculJxXFcKtFezQ.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb7591e024dc043041342072778b1385a760afb0', 'width': 320}, {'height': 336, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/jRlptExJiswfKDmTbPUtGpIyoE4QAculJxXFcKtFezQ.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b18c2e29bc2d153ef30717a00fa5120cf3d01d6', 'width': 640}, {'height': 504, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/jRlptExJiswfKDmTbPUtGpIyoE4QAculJxXFcKtFezQ.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=433f46cac77f789c7572935cd2889f6ef74722df', 'width': 960}, {'height': 567, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/jRlptExJiswfKDmTbPUtGpIyoE4QAculJxXFcKtFezQ.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2729fbdf4ec51b8a9539dc11ed7e3fdf26754931', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 630, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/jRlptExJiswfKDmTbPUtGpIyoE4QAculJxXFcKtFezQ.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=bf89740a2c4556c42a16d50bcbff19dfbfbdba3c', 'width': 1200}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

**PG1: Calvin Murphy (1970-83)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x All-Star

Stats: 17.9 PPG, 2.1 RPG, 4.4 APG, 1.5 SPG, 0.1 BPG

Drafted in the second round of the 1970 NBA Draft, Calvin Murphy excelled at point guard for the Rockets for many years, and is in the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame despite standing at only 5’9”. He was a really good scorer on offense while also being an aggressive defender. He averaged 15.8 PPG, 3 RPG, and 4 APG in his rookie year while only playing in 24.6 MPG, and improved in his second season, after the Rockets moved to Houston from San Diego, by averaging 18.2 PPG, 3.1 RPG, and 4.8 APG. He regressed a little in his third season, but Murphy was a consistently good point guard over the next seven seasons despite only making the All-Star team once as he averaged 20.5 PPG, 2.2 RPG, 5.2 APG, and 1.7 SPG during that span which included five seasons where he averaged at least 20 PPG. However, Murphy’s playing time decreased over his last three seasons, although he still averaged 13.4 PPG during that span before retiring after the 1982-83 season.

&amp;#x200B;

**PG2: Steve Francis (1999-04)**

Accolades w/Team: 3x All-Star, 1999-00 Rookie of the Year

Stats: 19 PPG, 6 RPG, 6.3 APG, 1.6 SPG, 0.4 BPG

The Houston Rockets acquired Steve Francis, after he was drafted second overall by the Vancouver Grizzlies, to be their franchise superstar for the future. Francis was really good as a rookie as he averaged 18 PPG, 5.3 RPG, and 6.6 APG en route to winning the Rookie of the Year award that season. Francis continued to be one of the NBA’s better young stars over the next three seasons as he averaged 20.8 PPG, 6.7 RPG, and 6.3 APG during that span while making the All-Star team in the latter two seasons. He never led the Rockets to the playoffs in that span, but he did lead them to a winning record in two of those seasons. After another All-Star selection in the 2003-04 season where he averaged 16.6 PPG, 5.5 RPG, and 6.2 APG, Francis was traded to the Orlando Magic in a deal that sent superstar Tracy McGrady to the Rockets.

&amp;#x200B;

**PG3: Kenny Smith (1990-96)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 2x NBA Champion

Stats: 12.6 PPG, 1.9 RPG, 5.3 APG, 1 SPG, 0.1 BPG

Before the start of the 1990-91 season, the Houston Rockets acquired Kenny Smith from the Atlanta Hawks to be their starting point guard. The Jet had his best season in his first season with the Rockets as he averaged 17.7 PPG and 7.1 APG while shooting 36.3% from three-point range (which would actually his lowest percentage in his six years in Houston). Even though Smith’s averages went down in each of his six seasons in H-Town, he remained the starting point guard over his last five seasons with the team as he averaged 11.6 PPG and 4.9 APG, shooting 41.2% from the three-point line on 2.9 attempts per game while helping them win two championships in 1994 and 1995 in that span. However, after the 1995-96 season, Smith was released by the Rockets and never played after the following season.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG1: James Harden (2012-)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x NBA MVP, 7x All-Star, 5x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 29 PPG, 6 RPG, 7.7 APG, 1.8 SPG, 0.6 BPG

Before the 2012-13 season, the Houston Rockets traded for the reigning Sixth Man of the Year in James Harden, and he thrived as an All-Star that season as he averaged 25.9 PPG, 4.9 RPG, and 5.8 APG. Over the next three seasons, Harden was paired up with All-Star center Dwight Howard and averaged 27.3 PPG, 5.5 RPG, and 6.9 APG while making the All-NBA 1st Team in the first two of those three seasons. However, after Howard signed with the Hawks in the 2016 offseason, Harden had an insane 2016-17 season as he averaged 29.1 PPG, 8.1 RPG, and a league-leading 11.2 APG which helped place second in that year’s MVP voting. Harden followed that up with an even better 2017-18 season as he averaged a league-leading 30.4 PPG, 5.4 RPG, and 8.8 APG while helping the Rockets win a league-best 65 games and winning the MVP award that year. Harden continued with his production this past season as he averaged an extraordinary 36.1 PPG (the most since Jordan in ‘87), 6.6 RPG, and 7.5 APG while placing second in the MVP voting again. Heading into the 2019-20 season, Harden looks to keep up with his production even after they acquired Russell Westbrook during the offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG2: Clyde Drexler (1995-98)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x NBA Champion, 2x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 19 PPG, 6.1 RPG, 5.4 RPG, 1.9 SPG, 0.6 BPG

Clyde Drexler was acquired by the Rockets during the 1994-95 season, and thrived immediately after joining the team mid-season as he averaged 21.4 PPG, 7 RPG, 4.4 RPG, and 1.8 SPG while helping the Rockets win their second NBA championship as Clyde the Glide averaged 21.5 PPG, 9.5 RPG, and 6.8 APG in four NBA Finals games against the Orlando Magic. Drexler was named an All-Star in each of his next two seasons as he averaged 18.6 PPG, 6.5 RPG, 5.8 APG, and 2 SPG during that span. Even in his final season, Drexler was still very good as he averaged 18.4 PPG, 4.9 RPG, 5.5 APG, and 1.8 SPG during the 1997-98 season before he retired after the Rockets’ season ended. Although Clyde isn’t most known for being a Rocket, his contributions to the team helped them win a championship.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG3: Cuttino Mobley (1998-04)**

Stats: 17.1 PPG, 4 RPG, 2.7 APG, 1.2 SPG, 0.4 BPG

Despite being drafted 41st overall by the Houston Rockets in the 1998 NBA Draft, Cuttino Mobley started at shooting guard during his rookie year as he averaged 9.9 PPG. Even though Cat started in his rookie year, he came off the bench in his second season but he improved his stats by averaging 15.8 PPG, 3.6 RPG, and 2.6 APG. After averaging 19.5 PPG, 5 RPG, and 2.5 APG in his third season, Cat had his best season in his fourth season as he averaged 21.7 PPG, 4.1 RPG, and 2.5 APG while shooting 39.5% from three. In his final two seasons with the Rockets, Mobley averaged 16.6 PPG, 4.3 RPG, and 3 APG during that span before being traded to the Orlando Magic during the 2004 offseason in the deal that sent Tracy McGrady to Houston.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF1: Tracy McGrady (2004-09)**

Accolades w/Team: 3x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 2x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 22.7 PPG, 5.5 RPG, 5.6 APG, 1.3 SPG, 0.6 BPG

Tracy McGrady was acquired by the Rockets during the 2004 offseason in a trade after leading the NBA in scoring in back-to-back seasons with the Magic. During his first season, McGrady was really good as he averaged 25.7 PPG, 6.2 RPG, and 5.7 APG which had some really good moments, including the time when he scored [13 points in 35 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-8FksMVAdU). However, McGrady was hampered by a series of injuries the following year, but he still averaged 24.4 PPG, 6.5 RPG, and 4.8 APG in 47 games. T-Mac was never the same player after that, in terms of athleticism, but he was still really good as he averaged 23.2 PPG, 5.2 RPG, and 6.2 APG over the next two seasons which included a 22-game win streak in the latter of those two years. However, McGrady was limited to 35 games in the 2008-09 season due to a knee injury, and he was traded during the middle of the following season after averaging just 7.7 MPG in six games for the Rockets in that season.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF2: Rudy Tomjanovich (1970-81)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 5x All-Star

Stats: 17.4 PPG, 8.1 RPG, 2 APG, 0.7 SPG, 0.3 BPG

Drafted second overall by the Houston Rockets, Rudy T is one of the all-time Rockets greats as he had a successful playing and coaching career for the franchise. Drafted second overall by the then-San Diego Rockets in the 1970 NBA Draft, Tomjanovich didn’t do much in his rookie season as he averaged 5.3 PPG and 4.9 RPG. However, the Rockets moved to Houston, and Rudy T improved in his first two seasons in H-Town as he averaged 17.2 PPG and 11.7 RPG during that span. Tomjanovich made the All-Star team in each of the next four seasons after that span as he averaged 21.4 PPG and 8.3 RPG during these four years. However, Tomjanovich’s 1977-78 season ended after 23 games due to being punched in the head by Kermit Washington. Even though Tomjanovich averaged 21.5 PPG and 6 RPG during those 23 games, he was never the same after the punch as he averaged 15.4 PPG and 6.1 RPG in his final three seasons before he retired before the 1981-82 season.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF3: Robert Reid (1977-82, 1983-88)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances

Stats: 11.6 PPG, 4.9 RPG, 3 APG, 1.2 SPG, 0.5 BPG

Although he was drafted in the second round of the 1977 NBA Draft, Robert Reid was solid in his first two seasons as he averaged 9.1 PPG and 5.2 RPG during that span. Reid garnered the starting small forward position for the Rockets over the next three seasons as he averaged 14.2 PPG, 6.5 RPG, and 3.8 APG during that span before retiring before the 1982-83 season. He would return to the Rockets for the start of the 1983-84 season, and he was still a key role on the team during the mid-1980s as he averaged 12 PPG, 4 RPG, and 3.1 APG during the next four seasons, including that one. After averaging just 6.3 PPG in the 1987-88 season, Reid was traded during the 1988 offseason to the Charlotte Hornets, who were headed into their inaugural season.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*PF1: Moses Malone (1976-82)\*\*Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 2x NBA MVP, 5x All-Star, 2x All-NBA 1st Team, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 24 PPG, 15 RPG, 1.5 SPG, 0.9 SPG, 1.6 BPG

After playing in six total minutes in the first two games of the 1976-77 season in Buffalo, Moses Malone was traded to the Houston Rockets. Moses instantly thrived as he averaged 13.5 PPG and 13.4 RPG in the next 80 games of that season with the Rockets, and followed that up with his first NBA All-Star selection in the next season as he averaged 19.4 PPG and 15 RPG. Malone followed that up with an even better 1978-79 season as he averaged 24.8 PPG and 17.6 RPG en route to winning that year’s MVP. After two more All-NBA seasons where he averaged a collective 26.8 PPG and 14.6 RPG as well as an NBA Finals appearance in the second of those two seasons, Malone had his best season in the 1981-82 season as he averaged 31.1 PPG and 14.7 RPG en route to his second MVP award with the franchise. Despite Malone leading the league in rebounding thrice in his Rockets tenure, the team changed ownership during the 1982 offseason, and he was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers before the start of the 1982-83 season.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF2: Elvin Hayes (1968-72, 1981-84)**

Accolades w/Team: 4x All-Star

Stats: 20.6 PPG, 12.2 RPG, 1.9 APG, 0.5 SPG, 0.9 BPG

Drafted first overall by the then-San Diego Rockets in the 1968 NBA Draft, Elvin Hayes thrived in his first season with the franchise as he averaged a league-leading 28.4 PPG despite being a rookie while also averaging a staggering 17.1 RPG. The Big E continued his dominance over the next three seasons with the team as he averaged 27.1 PPG and 16 RPG during that span before being traded to the Baltimore Bullets during the 1972 offseason due to clashing with then-Rockets coach Tex Winters. However, he was traded back to the Rockets, now in Houston, during the 1981 offseason after nine seasons with the Bullets, and he averaged 16.1 PPG and 9.1 RPG as a starter in the 1981-82 season. He played in two more seasons, averaging 8.9 PPG and 5.4 RPG while coming off the bench before retiring after the 1983-84 season.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF3: Otis Thorpe (1988-95)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x NBA Champion, 1x All-Star

Stats: 15.8 PPG, 9.7 RPG, 2.6 APG, 0.8 SPG, 0.3 BPG

Otis Thorpe was acquired by the Houston Rockets before the 1988-89 season to become the team’s starting power forward. Thorpe thrived in his first four seasons with the Rockets as he averaged 17.2 PPG and 9.8 RPG during that span while making the All-Star team in the final of those four seasons. After that All-Star selection in 1992, Thorpe’s scoring decreased, but he was still very good in the next two seasons as he averaged 13.5 PPG and 9.5 RPG which included helping the Rockets win an NBA championship in 1994. However, Thorpe was traded during the middle of the 1994-95 season to the Portland Trail Blazers for Clyde Drexler, after the defending champs struggled in the first half of that season, despite averaging 13.3 PPG and 8.9 RPG.

&amp;#x200B;

**C1: Hakeem Olajuwon (1984-2001)**

Accolades w/Team: 3 Finals Appearances, 2x NBA Champion, 2x Finals MVP, 1x NBA MVP, 12x All-Star, 2x Defensive Player of the Year, 6x All-NBA 1st Team, 3x All-NBA 2nd Team, 3x All-NBA 3rd Team, 5x All-Defensive 1st Team, 4x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 22.5 PPG, 11.4 RPG, 2.5 APG, 1.8 SPG, 3.2 BPG

Drafted first overall in the 1984 NBA Draft out of the University of Houston, Hakeem Olajuwon is one of the greatest centers in NBA history, and he spent 17 seasons with the Houston Rockets. The Dream instantly thrived in his rookie season as he averaged 20.6 PPG, 11.9 RPG, and 2.7 BPG en route to his first All-Star selection. After that season, Hakeem dominated as one of the NBA’s best centers over the next seven seasons as he averaged 23.2 PPG, 12.6 RPG, 2.1 SPG, and 3.7 BPG during that span while making the All-Star team in six out of those seven seasons, and while leading the league in rebounding and blocks two times each. However, Olajuwon’s scoring increased over the next four seasons as The Dream averaged 27 PPG, 11.7 RPG, 1.7 SPG, and 3.6 BPG during that span while winning the Defensive Player of the twice and winning an NBA championship twice during those four seasons. Hakeem won Finals MVP in both of those championships in 1994 and 1995 as he averaged 30.9 PPG, 10.7 RPG, 4.4 APG, 1.5 SPG, and 3.4 BPG throughout 45 games during both of those postseasons. After averaging 23.2 PPG and 9.2 RPG in the 1997-98 season, Hakeem averaged 14.4 PPG and 8.3 RPG in his final four seasons in H-Town before being traded to the Raptors during the 2001 offseason.

**C2: Yao Ming (2002-11)**

Accolades w/Team: 8x All-Star, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team, 3x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 19 PPG, 9.2 RPG, 1.6 APG, 0.4 SPG, 1.9 BPG

Yao Ming continues to the trend of centers being drafted with the first overall pick by the Houston Rockets, this time being drafted in 2002. The 7’6” Chinese center averaged 16.4 PPG, 8.5 RPG, and 1.9 BPG over his first three seasons in the NBA while making the All-Star team in each of them and only missing two games during that span. Despite foot injuries shortening Yao’s next three seasons to 57, 48, and 55 games respectively, Yao Ming actually improved in those three years as he averaged 23 PPG, 10.2 RPG, and 1.9 BPG during that span while making an additional three All-Star teams. After playing in 77 games during the 2008-09 season and averaging 19.7 PPG and 9.9 RPG, Yao fractured his foot during the 2009 playoffs, and only played in five more games in the NBA, all in the 2010-11 season, before retiring due to those injuries.

&amp;#x200B;

**C3: Ralph Sampson (1983-87)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 4x All-Star, 1985 All-Star Game MVP, 1983-84 Rookie of the Year, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 19.7 PPG, 10.5 RPG, 2.7 APG, 1 SPG, 1.9 BPG

All three of the centers on this all-time team were drafted with the first pick of their respective draft, and Ralph Sampson continued with this trend as he was drafted first overall in the 1983 NBA Draft by the Houston Rockets. Sampson was an exceptional center in his first two seasons in the NBA as he averaged 21.5 PPG, 10.8 RPG, and 2.2 BPG during that span while making the All-Star team both times and being selected to the All-NBA 2nd Team in his second season. After averaging 18.9 PPG and 11.1 RPG while helping lead the Rockets to the 1986 NBA Finals in the 1985-86 season, Sampson’s 1986-87 season was shortened to 43 games by knee injuries, but he still averaged 15.6 PPG and 8.7 RPG. After averaging 15.9 PPG and 9.1 RPG in the first 19 games of the 1987-88 season, Sampson was traded to the Golden State Warriors due to those previously-mentioned knee injuries that derailed his career.

**TL;DR All-Time Rockets Roster**

||Starters|Reserves|
|:-|:-|:-|
|PG|**Calvin Murphy**|Steve Francis, Kenny Smith|
|SG|**James Harden**|Clyde Drexler, Cuttino Mobley|
|SF|**Tracy McGrady**|Rudy Tomjanovich, Robert Reid|
|PF|**Moses Malone**|Elvin Hayes, Otis Thorpe|
|C|**Hakeem Olajuwon**|Yao Ming, Ralph Sampson|
||*Head Coach*|*Assistant Coaches*|
|Coaching Staff|Rudy Tomjanovich|Bill Fitch, Mike D'Antoni|

**Analysis**

* This team is really good. At PG, Calvin Murphy stands at just 5'9"", but he was a really good playmaker, scorer, and defender with the Rockets. They have two exceptional scoring wings who can shoot three-pointers very well in James Harden and Tracy McGrady. In addition to Harden's scoring, Harden has been a really good playmaker in the NBA. In addition, they have arguably the best big man duo among the all-time teams (with the exception of the Lakers) with Malone and Hakeem dominating the paint both offensively and defensively.
* I like this second unit. There are a lot of scorers on this bench with Francis, Drexler, Tomjanovich, Hayes, and Ming who all averaged at least 20 PPG in their best season with the team. The big men in the second unit will dominate the boards with Yao's 7'6"" frame and Elvin's exceptional rebounding with the Rockets. Also, Francis was an all-around guard who was super athletic.

Firstly we have CP3 he has not been the CP3 we used to know lately but he is still a good player with high basketball IQ and is a veteran that I think will help the young players on OKC develope. 

Secondly we have Danilo Gallinari. Last season he averaged 20 points per game and shot a whopping 40.3% from free averaging 5.5 attempts per game. Those numbers do not lie and from watching him a lot last season I only think that those stats will become even better.

Thirdly we have the beast center that is Steven Adams. Last season he averaged 14 points and 9.5 rebounds whilst playing together with Mr. Triple Double and Paul George. When you take that into consideration those are some good stats and I am 100% sure that they will be even better next season. 

Fourthly we have Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. He had a solid rookie season averaging 11/3/3 and he shot the ball from deep at a rate of almost 40%. Those stats he averaged eventhough he didn't have that big of a role on the Clippers last season. I believe that his role in OKC will be bigger and on that note I also believe that his numbers will improve a lot. My hot take within this hot take is therefore that he will average 20/5/5 next season.

Taking all this into consideration and the fact they also have some talent in players like Jerami Grant, Nerlens Noel and Terrance Ferguson, I can see them making the playoffs next season. 

The teams I see them possible beating in the playoff race are San Antonio Spurs, Sacramento Kings, New Orleans Pelicans and Dallas Mavericks.

**PG1: John Stockton (1984-2003)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 10x All-Star, 1993 All-Star Game MVP, 2x All-NBA 1st Team, 6x All-NBA 2nd Team, 3x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 13.1 PPG, 2.7 RPG, 10.5 APG, 2.2 SPG, 0.2 BPG

As the all-time leader in assists and steals, John Stockton is one of the greatest point guards in NBA history, spending his entire 19-year career with the Jazz. Drafted 16th overall in the 1984 NBA Draft, Stockton was solid while coming off the bench in his first three seasons as he averaged 7.1 PPG, 6.9 APG, and 1.8 SPG during that span. Over the next nine seasons after that span, Stockton led the NBA in assists in each of those seasons as he averaged 15.7 PPG, 13.1 APG, and 2.6 SPG during those nine seasons while making the All-Star team eight times as well as an All-NBA team in each of those nine seasons. Although Stockton never led the NBA in assists in any of the seven seasons after the 1995-96 season, he was still among the leaders in that category as he averaged 12.3 PPG, 8.6 APG, and 1.7 SPG in those final seven seasons, which included two NBA Finals appearances in 1997 and 1998, before retiring after the 2002-03 offseason. Not only was Stockton an elite point guard during his nineteen years in Utah, but he was also really healthy as he only missed 22 games throughout his entire career.

&amp;#x200B;

**PG2: Deron Williams (2005-11)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 17.3 PPG, 3.2 RPG, 9.1 APG, 1.1 SPG, 0.2 BPG

Drafted third overall in the 2005 NBA Draft, Deron Williams was in the discussion of the best point guard in the NBA during the late 2000s when he played for the Utah Jazz. After averaging 10.8 PPG and 4.5 APG during his rookie year, D-Will improved as the full-time starting point guard in his second season as he averaged 16.2 PPG and 9.3 APG while helping the Jazz make the Western Conference Finals that year. After that breakout sophomore season, D-Will emerged as one of the NBA’s top point guards over the next three seasons as he averaged 19 PPG and 10.6 APG during that span while making the All-Star team once and the All-NBA 2nd Team twice. Williams averaged 21.3 PPG and 9.7 APG in the first 53 games of the 2010-11 season with the Utah Jazz while making his second All-Star team before being traded to the New Jersey Nets during that season.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG1: Pete Maravich (1974-80)**

Accolades w/Team: 3x All-Star, 2x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 25.2 PPG, 4.3 RPG, 5.6 APG, 1.4 SPG, 0.3 BPG

The then-New Orleans Jazz, heading into their inaugural season, acquired former LSU superstar Pete Maravich from the Atlanta Hawks in a blockbuster trade during their expansion draft. Maravich continued with his impressive scoring in his first two seasons with the Jazz as he averaged 23.4 PPG, 5.1 RPG, and 5.8 APG during that span. However, Maravich had a huge 1976-77 campaign as he averaged a league-leading 31.1 PPG, 5.1 RPG, and 5.4 APG while making the All-NBA 1st Team. Despite dealing with knee issues the next season which caused him to miss 32 games, Maravich was still excellent that season as he averaged 27 PPG, 3.6 RPG, and 6.7 APG en route to another All-NBA 1st Team selection. Unfortunately for Pistol Pete, those knee issues would continue to hamper his play. He averaged 22.6 PPG and 5 APG the next season while missing 33 games, and the following year, after the team moved to Utah, he averaged 17.1 PPG in just 17 games before being waived midseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG2: Darrell Griffith (1980-91)**

Accolades w/Team: 1980-81 Rookie of the Year

Stats: 16.2 PPG, 3.3 RPG, 2.1 APG, 1.2 SPG, 0.3 BPG

Drafted second overall by the Utah Jazz in the 1980 NBA Draft to replace Pete Maravich, Darrell Griffith was an excellent dunker and three-point shooter during his ten seasons with the franchise. He was really good in his rookie season as he averaged 20.6 PPG en route to winning the Rookie of the Year award. Griffith averaged 21 PPG over his next two seasons before helping the Jazz make the playoffs for the first time in franchise history during the 1983-84 season. During that season, Griffith averaged 20 PPG while breaking the NBA’s record in three-pointers made in a season with 91 and shooting 36.1% on 3.1 attempts per game. Griffith improved even more in the next season as he averaged 22.6 PPG, broke his record for most threes made in a season with 92 while shooting 35.8% on 3.3 attempts per game. Unfortunately, Griffith missed the entire 1985-86 season due to a foot injury and averaged just 11 PPG in his final five seasons before retiring.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG3: Jeff Hornacek (1994-00)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances

Stats: 14.4 PPG, 2.8 RPG, 4 APG, 1.3 SPG, 0.2 BPG

Jeff Hornacek was acquired by the Utah Jazz during the 1993-94 season to help bolster their three-point shooting. Hornacek played in 27 games for the Jazz that season while averaging 14.6 PPG during those games. Hornacek would be the starting shooting guard and a solid piece on some contending Jazz teams over the next four seasons as he averaged 15.1 PPG and 4.3 APG while shooting 42% from three-point range on 2.4 attempts per game during that span. Hornacek played under 30 MPG in each of his final two seasons, but he averaged 12.3 PPG while shooting 45.7% from three on 1.8 attempts per game and 95% from the free-throw line in his final season before retiring after that final 1999-00 season.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF1: Adrian Dantley (1979-86)**

Accolades w/Team: 6x All-Star, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 29.6 PPG, 6.2 RPG, 3.7 APG, 1.1 SPG, 0.1 BPG

Adrian Dantley averaged 19.9 PPG and 7.2 RPG over his first three seasons on three separate teams before being traded to the Utah Jazz before the 1979-80 season. Dantley took advantage of this opportunity with the Jazz and averaged 28 PPG and 7.6 RPG in his first season with them while making his first All-Star team. Over the next four seasons, Dantley was one of the best scorers in the NBA as he averaged 30.5 PPG, 6.1 RPG, and 4 APG, while shooting 56.4% from the field during that span, leading the league in scoring twice during those four years, and averaging at least 30 PPG in each of those seasons. Even though Dantley never averaged 30 PPG after the 1983-84 season, he was still an exceptional scorer in his last two seasons with the Jazz while averaging 28.5 PPG, 5.5 RPG, and 3.4 APG during that span while making the All-Star team both times. However, Dantley was traded to the Detroit Pistons during the 1986 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF2: Gordon Hayward (2010-17)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star

Stats: 15.7 PPG, 4.2 RPG, 3.4 APG, 1 SPG, 0.4 BPG

After coming a half-court heave that hit back iron away from winning a national championship for Butler in 2010, Gordon Hayward was selected with the tenth overall pick in that year’s draft by the Utah Jazz, where he’d spent seven seasons while increasing his points per game average after each year. He didn’t get much playing time in his rookie season as he averaged 5.4 PPG on 16.9, he would start at small forward for the team during his sophomore season while averaging 11.8 PPG. After averaging 17.4 PPG, 4.5 RPG, and 4 APG over the next four seasons, Hayward made the All-Star team for the first time in the 2016-17 season while averaging 21.9 PPG, 5.4 RPG, and 3.5 APG which helped the Jazz make the playoffs for the first time since 2012. After that season, Hayward signed with the Boston Celtics as a free agent during the 2017 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF3: Thurl Bailey (1983-91, 1999)**

Stats: 14 PPG, 5.5 RPG, 1.6 APG, 0.5 SPG, 1.2 BPG

Thurl Bailey was selected with the seventh overall pick by the Utah Jazz in the 1983 NBA draft after helping N.C. State upset Houston in the 1983 NCAA Tournament Final in one of the greatest upsets in NCAA history. Bailey started in his first two seasons with the franchise as he averaged 11.8 PPG and 6.1 RPG during that span. However, Bailey took a bench role after his sophomore season, which he held for six seasons as he averaged 15.7 PPG and 5.5 RPG during that span which included a two-season span from 1987-89 where he averaged 19.5 PPG and 6 RPG. However, Bailey averaged just 9.4 PPG and 6 RPG over the first 13 games of the 1991-92 season before being traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves during that season. He returned for the 1999 lockout season but didn’t do much before retiring after that season.

**PF1: Karl Malone (1985-2003)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 2x NBA MVP, 14x All-Star, 2x All-Star Game MVP, 11x All-NBA 1st Team, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team, 3x All-Defensive 1st Team, 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 25.4 PPG, 10.2 RPG, 3.5 APG, 1.4 SPG, 0.8 BPG

With the second-most points scored in NBA history, Karl Malone is one of the greatest power forwards of all-time and the greatest player to play for this franchise with 18 excellent years. Drafted 13th overall by the Utah Jazz in the 1985 NBA Draft, Malone was very good in his rookie year as he averaged 14.9 PPG and 8.9 RPG, and improved in his second season where he averaged 21.7 PPG and 10.4 RPG. However, starting with his third season, Malone was selected to an All-NBA Team for fourteen consecutive seasons from 1987-2001. During that span, the Mailman averaged 27 PPG, 10.6 RPG, and 3.6 APG, made the All-NBA 1st Team eleven times out of those fourteen All-NBA selections, made the All-Defensive Team four times, helped the Jazz make the NBA Finals in both 1997 and 1998, and won two MVPs in 1997 and 1999. Interestingly enough, Malone didn’t make an All-NBA Team in his final two seasons, but he didn’t really slow down much as he still averaged 21.5 PPG, 8.2 RPG, 4.5 APG, and 1.8 APG during that final two-year span with the franchise before signing with the L.A. Lakers during the 2003 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF2: Carlos Boozer (2004-10)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 19.3 PPG, 10.5 RPG, 2.9 APG, 1 SPG, 0.4 BPG

Carlos Boozer signed with the Utah Jazz as a free agent during the 2004 offseason after averaging 15.5 PPG and 11.4 RPG in the previous season. Boozer was plagued with injuries in his first two seasons with the team as he only played in 84 games, but he was good as he averaged 17.2 PPG and 8.8 RPG during that span. However, Boozer made the All-Star team in each of his next two seasons as he averaged 21 PPG, 11 RPG, and 2.9 APG during that span while shooting 55.3% from the field. After an injury-plagued 2008-09 season where he played in just 37 games, Boozer bounced back in the next season as he averaged 19.5 PPG and 11.2 RPG during his last season with the Jazz before being traded to the Chicago Bulls during the 2010 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF3: Andrei Kirilenko (2001-11)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star, 1x All-Defensive 1st Team, 2x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 12.4 PPG, 5.6 RPG, 2.8 APG, 1.4 SPG, 2 BPG

Despite being drafted 24th overall by the Utah Jazz in the 1999 NBA Draft, Andrei Kirilenko did not join the franchise until 2001. He was solid in his first two seasons as he averaged 11.4 PPG, 5.1 RPG, 1.4 SPG, and 2.1 BPG during that span. However, Kirilenko broke out in his third season, after the retirement of John Stockton and the departure of Karl Malone, as he averaged 16.5 PPG, 8.1 RPG, 3.1 APG, 1.9 SPG, and 2.8 BPG en route to his first All-Star selection. He was a really good defensive power forward in that season as well as the two after that as he averaged 15.4 PPG, 7.3 RPG, 3.9 APG, 1.5 SPG, and 3.2 BPG during those two seasons which both resulted in All-Defensive selections. Kirilenko’s role decreased over his last five seasons with the Jazz as he averaged 10.8 PPG, 4.8 RPG, and 3.1 APG during that span before returning to Russia during the 2011 NBA lockout.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF4: Truck Robinson (1977-79)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 1st Team

Stats: 23.2 PPG, 14.9 RPG, 2 APG, 0.8 SPG, 1.1 BPG

Signed by the New Orleans Jazz during the 1977 offseason, Truck Robinson played in a season and a half with the franchise. During his first and only full season with the team, Truck averaged 22.7 PPG, and a league-leading 15.7 RPG despite being a 6’7” power forward en route to his first All-Star selection and a selection to the All-NBA 1st Team. Truck continued his production next season as he averaged 24.2 PPG and 13.4 RPG in 43 games with the Jazz that season. However, despite Robinson’s play, the Jazz were losing a lot of games, and Robinson was traded to the Phoenix Suns during the middle of that 1978-79 season.

&amp;#x200B;

**C1: Rudy Gobert (2013-)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x Defensive Player of the Year, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team, 3x All-Defensive 1st Team

Stats: 11.1 PPG, 10.5 RPG, 1.3 APG, 0.7 SPG, 2.2 BPG

The first and only current Jazz player to make this all-time team, Rudy Gobert has been a defensive force during his six seasons in Utah so far. After not getting much playing time in his rookie season, Gobert improved in his next two seasons, with the Jazz trading center Enes Kanter, as he averaged 8.7 PPG, 10.1 RPG, and 2.3 BPG during that span. The past three seasons have been really dominant for Gobert as he has averaged 14.6 PPG, 12.3 RPG, and 2.4 BPG during that span which has garnered him a selection on the All-Defensive 1st Team in all three of those seasons and two All-NBA selections in those three years as well as two Defensive Player of the Year awards in the past two years. Heading into the 2019-20 season, Gobert looks to continue his dominance on the defensive end while continuing his improvement on offense with the addition of point guard Mike Conley.

&amp;#x200B;

**C2: Mark Eaton (1982-93)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star, 2x Defensive Player of the Year, 3x All-Defensive 1st Team, 2x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 6 PPG, 7.9 RPG, 1 APG, 0.4 SPG, 3.5 BPG

Mark Eaton was drafted in the third round of the 1982 NBA Draft despite being 25 years old, but he turned out to be one of the best shot-blockers in NBA history. After averaging 4.3 PPG, 5.7 RPG, and 3.4 BPG in his rookie season, Eaton became the Jazz’s starting center in his second season while averaging 5.6 PPG, 7.3 RPG, and a league-leading 4.3 BPG. Eaton improved even more in his third season as he averaged 9.7 PPG, 11.3 RPG, and an NBA record 5.6 BPG en route to the first of his two Defensive Player of the Year awards. Eaton continued to be a dominant shot-blocker over his next four seasons as he averaged 7.3 PPG, 9.1 RPG, and 4.1 BPG during that span while making an All-Defensive Team in each of those seasons. However, Eaton started to slow down after his only All-Star selection in the 1988-89 season as he averaged 4.1 PPG, 6.6 RPG, and 2.2 BPG in his final four seasons before retiring.

&amp;#x200B;

**C3: Mehmet Okur (2004-11)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star

Stats: 15.3 PPG, 7.6 RPG, 1.9 APG, 0.5 SPG, 0.7 BPG

After averaging 9.6 PPG and 5.9 RPG off the bench for the Pistons on their championship squad in 2004, Mehmet Okur signed with the Utah Jazz as a free agent during that offseason. Okur came off the bench for a majority of his first season with the team as he averaged 12.9 PPG and 7.5 RPG, but he improved as the starting center in his second season with the Jazz as he averaged 18 PPG and 9.1 RPG. Okur was one of the best stretch bigs over the next four seasons as he averaged 15.7 PPG and 7.4 PRG while shooting 39.7% from the three-point line on 3.5 attempts per game. Unfortunately, Okur dealt with an Achilles injury that limited him to just 13 games in the 2010-11 season before being traded to the Nets during the 2011 offseason.

**TL;DR All-Time Jazz Roster**

||Starters|Reserves|
|:-|:-|:-|
|PG|**John Stockton**|Deron Williams|
|SG|**Pete Maravich**|Darrell Griffith, Jeff Hornacek|
|SF|**Adrian Dantley**|Gordon Hayward, Thurl Bailey|
|PF|**Karl Malone**|Carlos Boozer, Andrei Kirilenko, Truck Robinson|
|C|**Rudy Gobert**|Mark Eaton, Mehmet Okur|
||*Head Coach*|*Assistant Coaches*|
|Coaching Staff|Jerry Sloan|Quin Snyder, Frank Layden|

**Analysis**

* This is another high-octane offense among these All-Time teams in the Western Conference (the Kings, Suns, Nuggets just to name a few). With Stockton passing to Malone, Maravich, Dantley, or Gobert, the Jazz can score in many ways. Pistol Pete had the shooting ability, Dantley was an excellent scorer along with the Mailman who can deliver in the paint as well as efficient scoring big Rudy Gobert, and even Stockton could score as he was a really good three-point shooter. Among those elite offenses of the All-Time teams, the Jazz have a really good defense compared to the Suns and Kings as Stockton and Malone have both made multiple All-Defensive teams and Gobert can defend other bigs in the paint.
* The bench has a really good offense. Like Stockton, Deron Williams could pass the ball well and shoot threes although his defense is quite worse. He has a lot of options like Griffith who can drive inside and shoot threes, Hayward who was a really good shooter and driver, and Boozer with his excellent mid-range game. Manning the middle is center Mark Eaton who will not score a lot of points, but he will get a lot of blocks.

I’ll start with KD.

Since 2010 KD has averaged no less than 25 points. He’s also been improving as a playmaker and recently had a 6apg season and was already an elite positional rebounder. He’s gotten 2 scoring titles, 2 fmvps and an mvp.

Stephen Curry has been transcendent as well. Started his career a little late for an all time great but since 2013 has been an all star and averaged no less than 24 PPG, also an elite scorer and playmaker and the greatest offensive player I’ve ever seen. He has no weaknesses as a shooter and very few as a scorer. 2 mvps, 3 rings (while beating LeBron 3 times) countless all nba.

Accolades w/Team: 112-73 Regular Season Record, 17-11 Playoff Record



**PG1: Tim Hardaway (1996-01)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 1st Team, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 17.3 PPG, 3.2 RPG, 7.8 APG, 1.5 SPG, 0.1 BPG

Tim Hardaway was a really good point guard during his five-and-a-half years with the Miami Heat. Hardaway was acquired by the Heat during the 1995-96 season from the Warriors, and he averaged 17.2 PPG, 3.5 RPG, 10 APG, and 2.1 SPG in 28 games for them that season. However, his first full season in South Beach would be a big one for Hardaway as he averaged 20.3 PPG, 3.4 RPG, and 8.6 APG while helping the Heat reach the Eastern Conference Finals en route to an All-NBA 1st Team selection that season. Hardaway would continue to be one of the NBA’s best point guards over the next two seasons as he averaged 18.3 PPG, 3.5 RPG, and 7.9 APG during that span while making the All-NBA 2nd Team. However, age was starting to get to Hardaway, and he averaged 14.3 PPG and 6.7 APG in his final two seasons in Miami before being traded to the Dallas Mavericks during the 2001 offseason.



**PG2: Goran Dragic (2015-)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star

Stats: 16.7 PPG, 3.8 RPG, 5.4 APG, 1 SPG, 0.2 BPG

Goran Dragic has been a very good point guard during his four-and-a-half-year stint with the Miami Heat so far. Acquired by the Heat during the 2015 trade deadline, Dragic was solid in his 26 games for them that season as he averaged 16.6 PPG, 3.4 RPG, and 5.3 APG. After averaging 14.1 PPG, 3.8 RPG, and 5.8 APG in his first full season with the Heat, Dragic improved in the 2016-17 season as he averaged 20.3 PPG, 3.8 RPG, and 5.8 APG. Although Dragic’s stats fell off a bit in the next season as he averaged 17.3 PPG, 4.1 RPG, and 4.8 APG, he was able to make his first All-Star team that season. Dragic only played in 36 games this past season due to a knee injury, but he looks to bounce back for the upcoming season with Jimmy Butler joining the Heat this offseason.



**SG1: Dwyane Wade (2003-16, 2018-19)**

Accolades w/Team: 5 Finals Appearances, 3x NBA Champion, 1x Finals MVP, 13x All-Star, 2010 All-Star Game MVP, 2x All-NBA 1st Team, 3x All-NBA 2nd Team, 3x All-NBA 3rd Team, 3x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 22.7 PPG, 4.7 RPG, 5.6 APG, 1.6 SPG, 0.9 BPG

Dwyane Wade is the greatest player in Miami Heat history as he had an excellent 15-year stint with the franchise. Drafted fifth overall by the Miami Heat in the 2003 NBA Draft, Wade was good in his rookie season as he averaged 16.2 PPG, 4 RPG, and 4.5 APG, but he had a huge second season, paired with Shaq, as he averaged 24.1 PPG, 5.2 RPG, and 6.8 APG while making the All-NBA 2nd Team. Wade took over the alpha dog role for the franchise in his third season as he averaged 27.2 PPG, 5.7 RPG, 6.7 APG, and 1.9 SPG while also helping the Heat win an NBA championship as he won Finals MVP by averaging 34.7 PPG and 7.8 RPG in six games against the Dallas Mavericks. Wade would still be an All-Star, although marred by injuries, in the next two seasons, but Wade was stellar in the 2008-09 season as he averaged 30.2 PPG, 5 RPG, 7.5 APG, 2.2 SPG, and 1.3 BPG while making the All-NBA 1st Team for the first time. That would be Wade’s best season, but he was still an All-Star in each of the next seven seasons, even with LeBron James and Chris Bosh, as he averaged 22.3 PPG, 4.8 RPG, 5 APG, and 1.5 SPG during that span while helping the Heat win two more championships. Although Wade left in free agency to the Bulls in the 2016 offseason, he’d return to the Heat in the 2018 trade deadline. Wade had his farewell season this past season as he averaged 15 PPG in that season before retiring.



**SG2: Eddie Jones (2000-05, 2007)**

Stats: 16 PPG, 4.5 RPG, 3 APG, 1.3 SPG, 0.6 BPG

After having an All-NBA season with the Hornets in the 1999-00 season, Jones was traded to the Miami Heat during the 2000 offseason. Jones was a very good shooting guard, and he averaged 17.8 PPG, 4.4 RPG, 3.2 APG, and 1.4 SPG during his first four seasons with the franchise even though he never made the All-Star team in that span. However, Jones averaged just 12.7 PPG, 5.1 RPG, and 2.7 APG during his fifth season as his scoring role diminished due to the acquisition of Shaq and the rise of Dwyane Wade. Jones was traded to the Grizzlies during the 2005 offseason, but he returned to the Heat during the 2006-07 season although he averaged just 9.5 PPG in 35 games.



**SF1: LeBron James (2010-14)**

Accolades w/Team: 4 Finals Appearances, 2x NBA Champion, 2x Finals MVP, 2x NBA MVP, 4x All-Star, 4x All-NBA 1st Team, 3x All-Defensive 1st Team, 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 26.9 PPG, 7.6 RPG, 6.7 APG, 1.7 SPG, 0.7 BPG

Even though LeBron James only played four seasons with the Miami Heat, they were arguably the best seasons of his NBA career. James ""took his talents to South Beach"" during the 2010 season and was really good in his first season with them as he averaged 26.7 PPG, 7.5 RPG, and 7 APG while making the All-NBA 1st Team and helping the Heat reach the Finals that season. Even though James had a mediocre NBA Finals performance that year against the Mavericks, he bounced back in each of his next two seasons as he averaged 26.9 PPG, 8 RPG, 6.8 APG, and 1.8 SPG during that span. Not only that, but he won an MVP in each of those two seasons, but he helped the Heat win an NBA championship in both of those seasons as he averaged 28.1 PPG, 9.1 RPG, 6.1 APG, and 1.8 APG during both the 2012 and 2013 postseason runs combined. James was still phenomenal in the 2013-14 season as he averaged 27.1 PPG, 6.9 RPG, and 6.3 APG en route to another All-NBA 1st Team selection. However, the Heat lost to the Spurs in five games in the 2014 NBA Finals, and the King returned home to Cleveland during the 2014 offseason.



**SF2: Glen Rice (1989-95)**

Stats: 19.3 PPG, 4.9 RPG, 2.2 APG, 1.2 SPG, 0.3 BPG

Drafted fourth overall by the Miami Heat in the 1989 NBA Draft, Glen Rice was a very good player and excellent sharpshooter during his six seasons with the franchise. Rice was a solid player as he averaged 15.5 PPG and 4.8 RPG during his first two seasons. However, Rice emerged as one of the NBA’s elite three-point shooters over the next four seasons as he averaged 21.2 PPG and 5 RPG during that span while shooting 39.3% from three-point range on 4.9 attempts per game during those four seasons despite not making an All-Star team in any of those seasons. Even with Rice’s excellent shooting ability, the Heat traded him to the Hornets before the 1995-96 season for All-Star center Alonzo Mourning.



**SF3: Jamal Mashburn (1997-00)**

Stats: 15.8 PPG, 5.2 RPG, 3.4 APG, 1 SPG, 0.2 BPG

Jamal Mashburn was a solid player on the Miami Heat during the late 1990s when they were Eastern Conference contenders. Mashburn arrived in South Beach during the 1997 trade deadline and averaged 13.4 PPG, 5.6 RPG, and 3.5 APG in 32 games that season. Although Mashburn missed a total of 50 games over the next two seasons due to injury, he improved during that span compared to his first half-season as he averaged 15 PPG, 5.3 RPG, and 2.9 APG during those two seasons. Mashburn played a full season again in the 1999-00 season as he had his best season in Miami and averaged 17.5 PPG, 5 RPG, and 3.9 APG. However, Mashburn was traded to the Hornets during the 2000 offseason in the deal that sent Eddie Jones to the Heat.



**PF1: Chris Bosh (2010-16)**

Accolades w/Team: 4 Finals Appearances, 2x NBA Champion, 6x All-Star

Stats: 18 PPG, 7.3 RPG, 1.8 APG, 0.9 SPG, 0.9 BPG

After five All-Star selections with the Toronto Raptors, Chris Bosh signed with the Miami Heat, along with LeBron, during the 2010 offseason. During his four seasons with both James and Wade, Bosh was a really good third option as he averaged 17.3 PPG and 7.4 RPG during that span while making the All-Star team both times and helping the Heat win two NBA championships. After LeBron returned to Cleveland during the 2014 offseason, and Bosh saw an increase in production in the season after that as he averaged 21.1 PPG and 7 RPG before a blood clot ended his 2014-15 season after 44 games. The next season, Bosh averaged 19.1 PPG and 7.4 RPG with yet another All-Star selection before another blood clot ended his 2015-16 season after 53 games. Sadly, those blood clots would be career-ending for Bosh, but he was still important to the Heat’s big three during their championship run.



**PF2: Udonis Haslem (2003-)**

Accolades w/Team: 5 Finals Appearances, 3x NBA Champion

Stats: 7.6 PPG, 6.7 RPG, 0.9 APG, 0.5 SPG, 0.3 BPG

Despite being signed as an undrafted free agent by the Heat in 2003, Udonis Haslem has played in 16 seasons with the franchise so far. Haslem was solid in his rookie year as he averaged 7.3 PPG and 6.3 RPG. After that rookie season, Haslem was a key piece of the Heat rotation over the next seven seasons as he averaged 10.5 PPG and 8.4 RPG during that span. However, a torn ligament shortened Udonis Haslem’s 2010-11 season to 13 games, and he was never the same player after that. He has played in each of the eight last seasons, although he only averaged 3.8 PPG and 4.5 RPG. Haslem is a great veteran presence in the locker room, so he’s on the Heat roster still despite only playing in 40 games over the last three seasons.



**PF3: P.J. Brown (1996-00)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 9.9 PPG, 7.9 RPG, 1.4 APG, 0.9 SPG, 1.1 BPG

P.J. Brown signed with the Miami Heat during the 1996 offseason and was a key member of the franchise for four years when they were contending during the late 1990s. As the starting power forward on those teams, Brown was solid while averaging 9.9 PPG and 7.9 RPG. He wasn’t much offensively, but his defense was really good as he made two All-Defensive teams in four seasons with the team. During the 2000 offseason, Brown was traded to the Charlotte Hornets with Jamal Mashburn in the deal that sent Eddie Jones to Miami.



**PF4: Grant Long (1988-94)**

Stats: 11.6 PPG, 7 RPG, 2.1 APG, 1.4 SPG, 0.5 BPG

Grant Long was a solid player in a little over six seasons with the Miami Heat. Despite being drafted in the second round in the 1988 NBA Draft, Long had a solid rookie year as he averaged 11.9 PPG and 6.7 RPG. After his stats decreased to 8.8 PPG and 6 RPG during the next two seasons, the two seasons after that were better as he averaged 14.4 PPG and 8 RPG during that span. After playing one more season with the Heat while averaging 11.4 PPG and 7.2 RPG, Long was traded to the Atlanta Hawks two games into the following 1994-95 season.



**C1: Alonzo Mourning (1995-02, 2005-08)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x NBA Champion, 5x All-Star, 2x Defensive Player of the Year, 1x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 2x All-Defensive 1st Team

Stats: 16 PPG, 8.1 RPG, 1.1 APG, 0.5 SPG, 2.7 BPG

Alonzo Mourning was an elite center during the apex of his NBA career, and he played 11 seasons for the Miami Heat. Acquired in a trade by the Heat before the 1995-96 season, Mourning was impressive in his first three seasons with the franchise as he averaged 20.9 PPG, 10 RPG, and 2.6 BPG during that span while making the All-Star team twice. However, Mourning emerged as one of the NBA’s best defensive players over the next two seasons as he averaged 21.1 PPG, 10.1 RPG, and 3.8 BPG during that span while making an All-NBA team and winning the Defensive Player of the Year both times. Unfortunately, Mourning was diagnosed with kidney disease before the 2000-01 season which would affect the rest of his career. He played in 13 games that season and averaged 15.7 PPG, 8.4 RPG, and 2.5 BPG the next season before missing the entire 2002-03 season due to those kidney issues. Mourning returned to the Heat for a second stint that lasted three-and-a-half seasons which included helping the Heat win a championship in 2006 before retiring.



**C2: Shaquille O’Neal (2004-08)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x NBA Champion, 3x All-Star, 2x All-NBA 1st Team

Stats: 19.6 PPG, 9.1 RPG, 2.1 APG, 0.4 SPG, 1.9 BPG

Shaquille O’Neal was a really good center in three-and-a-half-years with the Miami Heat even though it wasn’t as tremendous as his Magic and Lakers tenures. Acquired by the Heat during the 2004 offseason, O’Neal thrived in his first season in South Beach as he averaged 22.9 PPG, 10.4 RPG, and 2.3 BPG while placing second in the MVP voting. Even though Shaq’s next season was shortened to 59 games due to injuries, he was still really good as he averaged 20 PPG and 9.2 RPG while helping the Heat win a championship that year. Unfortunately, after that championship run, O’Neal was never the same player due to those aforementioned injuries. Shaq played in just 40 games the following year while averaging 17.3 PPG and 7.4 RPG and making the All-Star team still. However, O’Neal struggled in the 2007-08 season as his stats went down to 14.2 PPG and 7.8 RPG, and he was traded to the Phoenix Suns mid-way through that season.



**C3: Hassan Whiteside (2014-19)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 14.1 PPG, 11.9 RPG, 0.6 APG, 0.7 SPG, 2.4 BPG

Hassan Whiteside was signed with the Miami Heat a month into the 2014-15 season and was a very good center in five seasons with the team. He was solid in 48 games that season, despite being sent to the D-League at times during the first half of that season, as he averaged 11.8 PPG and 10 RPG. Whiteside emerged as one of the better defensive bigs over the next two seasons as he averaged 15.7 PPG, 13 RPG, and 2.9 BPG during that span. However, his last two seasons haven’t been much as he hasn’t helped the Heat much despite averaging 13 PPG and 11.4 RPG during that span. He was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers just this offseason after his production dropped in those last two seasons.



**C4: Rony Seikaly (1988-94)**

Stats: 15.4 PPG, 10.4 RPG, 1.3 APG, 0.7 SPG, 1.4 BPG

Rony Seikaly was a very good center in his six seasons with the Miami Heat. As the first-ever draft pick in the history of the franchise, Seikaly had a solid rookie season as he averaged 10.9 PPG and 7 RPG. However, Seikaly improved in his sophomore season as he averaged 16.6 PPG and 10.4 RPG while winning that year’s Most Improved Player. After that much improved season, Seikaly remained a really good big man over the next three seasons as he averaged 16.6 PPG and 11.6 RPG during that span. After averaging 15.1 PPG and 10.3 RPG in the 1993-94 season, Seikaly was traded to the Golden State Warriors before the 1994-95 season.

**Analysis**

* This all-time team's starting lineup is really good. The Big Three in Miami during the early 2010s and the duo of Hardaway and Mourning of the late 1990s team up to create this all-time team's starting five. They have excellent playmaker and scorer Tim Hardaway at the point, all-around shooting guard and very good defender Dwyane Wade, the King, All-Star and stretch four Chris Bosh, and Alonzo Mourning who was a solid inside presence both offensively and defensively.
* The bench doesn't have a lot of All-Stars (with the Heat), but that second unit is really good. Dragic was an All-Star and has been a very good point guard. In addition, you have one of the most dominant centers in Shaq, three-point shooter Glen Rice, and a really good three-and-D guy in Eddie Jones. In addition, Udonis Haslem, the backup four, was a solid post presence on both sides of the ball and provides great leadership as a Heat lifer.

He can’t shoot like Steph Curry. He can’t attack the basket with the force of Russell Westbrook. He might not even be able to defend one-on-one better than John Wall at this point of his career. But even after 12 seasons—six each with the Hornets and Clippers; God forbid even his tenures with teams not be perfectly balanced—he remains the class at point guard because he is the only one capable of high-level execution of everything the position requires. He’s the total package. He’s Mario in Mario Kart.

Last season, he was seventh among point guards who played at least 60 games in assist ratio (behind six pass-first PGs, all of whom averaged under 12 points a game), fourth in true shooting percentage, and seventh in rebound rate, despite only the 16th-highest usage rate. He may not hit the same peaks or even the sheer volume of the younger guard, but he seamlessly wedges the best of Steph (41.1 percent from 3) and the best of Russ (60.3 percent at the rim, per Basketball-Reference) into his already diverse repertoire. All told, he was fourth at his position in PER, and ninth in the entire NBA, marking 10 straight years without ever dropping out of the top 10. And while his individual defense and the Clippers defense took a noticeable step back from the season prior, it’s worth noting he finished first in defensive real plus-minus for the second year in a row and was named first team all-defense for the sixth year in a row.

It’s all there, and all deployed with the calm and poise of an experienced tactician. It’s just harder to appreciate adroit chess moves as Curry reels off shots CGI’d by Benioff and Weiss and Westbrook barrels full-speed like a monster truck. The past two MVPs inject all sorts of wonder into a routine Tuesday night; Paul’s game, meanwhile, is all about being one step ahead in order to snuff out any potential surprises.

But being a model of consistency has also become something of a cruel joke. Paul’s individual success has assured him a spot in the Hall of Fame, but he’s simultaneously lost the grip on his career’s narrative after a series of playoff meltdowns. Even as he persists as the shining example of how we traditionally define the position, players with modern spins like Curry and Westbrook have reached greater heights, both on the awards circuit and in the postseason. So it is shocking to see the figurehead of a generation of point guards attempt to extend his title window by teaming up with James Harden, perhaps the best point guard, statistically, in the NBA last season despite not technically being a point guard.

But the best route to getting better—which he alluded to after another crushing Game 7 defeat this past April—may be more about approach than execution.

The volume of talent playing top-to-bottom in the Western Conference far outstrips that of the Eastern Conference. This creates problems. It means that worthy franchises fail to make the playoffs in one conference, while “also-rans” receive a false honour in playing past April in the other.

Parity
Like true democracy, parity is an ideology that will never be fully realised. Instead it represents the standard the NBA should strive to continually improve and adapt towards becoming. It is the very foundation on which the draft system was based. It is the very essence as to why the salary cap was introduced.

While conferences and, to a lesser degree, divisions were important, their presence was a necessity borne of a different, bygone era. A time where there were less teams in the NBA and travel standards included commercial flights and hitchhiking to games. That time is no more, with teams travelling from city to city in extravagant luxury.

Historic rivalries could still be created, such as the Lakers and Celtics. But it takes more than just meeting in the NBA Finals a few times to create these. Chicago-Utah was not a rivalry, just a couple of competitive series.

Golden State-Cleveland is not a rivalry, just a couple of competitive(ish) series and two blowouts. Even if it were (which it’s not), the rivalry would well and truly be dead by now. In the latter two examples, the only things these teams had, to even spark the idea of a contentious coexistence, was that they met in the Finals. And this alone is not enough.

The main event
If we look at the Finals, as heroic as LeBron’s performances were, was that really the match-up fans around the world deserved? A 4-0 sweep, apparently underscoring the huge gap between the Warriors and everyone else.

The truth, the Warriors barely escaped the Conference Finals, and only did so thanks to a Chris Paul injury and a monumental choke from the Rockets in the last quarter of their season. All it did was underscore the gap between the Western powerhouses and their Eastern counterparts.

Wouldn’t a more competitive series be better for the fans and increase the perceived  value of a title? “Congrats Super-Team, you beat the barely conscious Cavs in four games, well done you…”

Don’t get me wrong, there are good teams in the East. Just nowhere near as many as out West. And, in recent history, no powerhouses (though the Toronto Raptors are flirting with that this year and the Milwaukee Bucks are on track to be there in the next couple of seasons *crosses multiple fingers*).

The fix
The regular season should be overhauled to minimise schedule bias by doing away with the conferences and divisions. The 82-game season (let’s stick with that for now, that’s a whole other diatribe) could be played almost equally against 29 opponents, with each team facing the other franchises an average of 2.83 times per season.

This could be implemented in a similar rotation to the current “remaining conference rivals” strategy, whereby, in some years you play an opponent three times and in other years, twice.

Research has already been done into the implications of leveling the schedule and removing conferences. Last season, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver addressed the idea of creating a true 1-16 playoff structure. He expressed concerns around the amount of travel that a team could experience in the opening round. It’s one of the key arguments many make. Here’s why increased travel is not an excuse.

Implementing these changes is estimated to result in an increase of 150,000 miles of travel in the regular season (based on 2017-2018) across the entire league. On top of the 1.4 million miles that were clocked last season, that’s an increase of just under 11%.

If you looked at it another way, that’s just 5,000 miles per team, per season. With the average speed of a Boeing 747 being 550mph, that’s just over nine hours of extra flight time per team per season. An average of 13.2 minutes additional air time per road game.

He finally reached unrestricted free agency in 2013 and decided to try and play outside of Kobe Bryant's shadow in L.A., and joined up with the Houston Rockets on a four year $87.5M contract to join forces with James Harden to be a formidable duo.

It was in his first year with the Rockets that Dwight averaged 18.3 points, 12.2 rebounds and 1.8 blocks in 33-34 minutes played, and started all 71 games at center as a massive upgrade on Omer Asik, and earned his one last NBA All-Star appearance for the Rockets.

But in the 1st round of the 2014 NBA Playoffs vs the Portland Trail Blazers (led by Damian Lillard and LaMarcus Aldridge), Dwight Howard turned back the clock to his Orlando Magic heyday as far as his stat averages for the 2014 playoffs went up to 26 points per game, 13.7 rebounds per game and 2.8 blocks per game in 38 minutes per game proved it, and was the league leader in TRB per game and BLK per game for the playoffs.

Even if it happened against Robin Lopez (Portland's starting center), I think Dwight had a monster playoff run that year. Since 2014, Dwight ended up mostly playing secondary star for the rest of his Rockets tenure as he was limited to 41 games in 2014-15 to a Torn MCL/Meniscus so they had to rely on Donatas Motiejunas and Joey Dorsey to fill in for him as the interm starting center.

And when he was healthy in 2015-16, Dwight was reduced to 13.7 points, 11.8 rebounds and 1.6 blocks in 32 minutes as James Harden was clearly the undisputed go-to-guy for the Rockets, and the Rockets needed Clint Capela (who was the starter at PF in Dwight's last season with Houston) to be their main center, and so after his contract with the Rockets expired, Dwight Howard went back to free agency where the 2016 free agent class was the mother of all free agent class bonanzas, and capitalized on the bonanza by joining his hometown Atlanta Hawks on a three-year, $70.5M contract in 2016 but has bounced around the league even more since then with Atlanta, Charlotte, Brooklyn (never played due to buyout), Washington, Memphis (never played due to buyout) and is now heading back to the Lakers as a role player and an insurance backup behind JaVale McGee after former Golden State Warriors player DeMarcus Cousins tore up his ACL.

What are your thoughts on Dwight Howard's 2014 playoff run before a Torn MCL/Meniscus ended his prime for good?

**GS's Offense** 

* The Warriors play a unique brand of basketball. While the PnR is the bread and butter for most teams the Warriors run it the least in the league. They have been at the bottom for the past 4 years with the exception of the 17-18 where Philly ran it the least.

* One of the main reasons why they are so effective and run these types of plays is because of their dominant 3PT%. Last year they had 3 players shooting in the 40s and 5 players shooting in the mid-late 30s (attempting more then 3 shots) Draymond and Cousins were the worst on the team....The year before they had 4 in the 40s. The year prior they had 5 elite shooters.

* The sheer amount of shooters allows the Warriors to have players who are not just big to set screens. Curry leading the league for guards. This is what allows them to be so deadly and effectively getting easy buckets with cuts. When you have so many shooters and Curry being the deadliest it's hard for defenses to choose who to prioritize. Yes Curry has the gravity to pull defenders but when 3/5 players can shoot at 40% and the 4th player being Draymond who is a great passer and can hit the open man it's almost impossible to play the right defense. 

* They also tend to utilize the passing of their big men in Zaza, West, Draymond. This allows them to run the Pin Down to great efficiency. 

**GS Defense**

* GS's Defense is underrated in my opinion. They have an array of versatile defenders: Draymond, Klay, Livingston, Iggy, Looney, and even KD. 

* I don't want make this post super long but something to note: GS defense and defenders allow Curry's defense to be hidden (he isn't the worst defender). They often look to hide him on defense and while this is exploited at times during the playoffs more often then not they succeed. 

* He is also rarely guarding the best guards on the opposing teams (Klay does this) allowing him to run so much on the offense. 


**Conclusion** 

* I'm not trying to take bring down Curry or downplay his importance. He is otherworldly. I'm simply highlighting the fact that Curry is not the system. Curry plays a vital role but he is also surrounded with absurd talent and a great coach who is implementing the ""pace and space"" style of play. 

* If we were to swap Curry with a PG on another team while he is still going to put up good number he is going to have more difficult time finding his shot. Teams would have an easier time containing him in transition or the half court where the game is slowed down. Players can't provide the spacing Klay or KD would. Letting a traditional big hold the ball would create more post ups. The paint would be way more clogged and Curry isn't the best at driving into the lane. 

* All in all Curry is great but I think the Warriors created an unique system which is so hard to mimic due to the sheer talent they have acquired.  I don't think he will have the same success if he were on another team.",True,False,,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,64181,public,self,"Steph Curry is not ""The System""",0,1566668768,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cuh9wr/steph_curry_is_not_the_system/,,,,,,,,,,,,

**PG1: Lafayette “Fat” Lever (1984-90)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 17 PPG, 7.6 RPG, 7.5 APG, 2.5 SPG, 0.3 BPG

Fat Lever was a really all-around point guard during his six years with the Denver Nuggets. Acquired by the Nuggets from the Trail Blazers during the 1984 offseason, Lever was solid in his first two seasons with the team as their starting point guard as he averaged 13.3 PPG, 5.2 RPG, 7.5 APG, and 2.4 SPG. However, Lever would emerge as one of the NBA’s better defensive and well-rounded guards with no real weaknesses during his next four seasons as he averaged 18.9 PPG, 8.9 RPG, 7.5 APG, and 2.5 SPG during that span which included two All-Star selections and an All-NBA selection. Even though he was named to his second All-Star team in the 1989-90 season while shooting 41.4% from three-point range that year, Lever was traded after that season to the Dallas Mavericks.

&amp;#x200B;

**PG2: Larry Jones (1967-70)**

Accolades w/Team: 3x All-Star, 3x All-ABA 1st Team

Stats: 25.4 PPG, 6.6 RPG, 4.2 APG

Larry Jones played for the 76ers for 23 games and the EBL for two seasons before he signed with the Denver Rockets of the ABA during the 1967 offseason. His first season with the team was a success as he averaged 22.9 PPG, 7.9 RPG, and 3.6 APG en route to a selection to the All-ABA 1st Team. After a huge first season, Jones had an even better second season with the team as he averaged a league-leading 28.4 PPG, 6.6 RPG, and 3.4 APG while placing third in the ABA MVP voting in addition to another All-ABA 1st Team selection. Jones did drop off a bit in his third season as he averaged 24.9 PPG and 5.2 RPG, but his assists went up to 5.7 APG per to earn his third selection to the All-ABA 1st Team. After that 1969-70 season, Jones was traded to the Miami Floridians despite three very successful seasons with the Rockets.

&amp;#x200B;

**PG3: Chauncey Billups (1999-00, 2008-11)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 16.9 PPG, 2.7 RPG, 5.3 APG, 1.1 SPG, 0.2 BPG

A native of Denver, Colorado, Chauncey Billups got to play for his hometown Nuggets for five different seasons on two stints with the franchise. Billups’s first stint with the Nuggets wasn’t much as he averaged 12.7 PPG in his first two seasons with the team before injuring his shoulder 13 games into that second season with them before being traded to the Magic during that season. Billups would return via a trade with the Detroit Pistons two games into the 2008-09 season, and he averaged 17.9 PPG, 3 RPG, and 6.4 APG in 77 games for the Nuggets while making the All-NBA 3rd Team and helping the Nuggets reach the Western Conference Finals that year. Billups had another All-Star year the following year as he averaged 19.5 PPG, 3.1 RPG, and 5.6 APG, but he was traded midway through the 2010-11 season to the Knicks via the Carmelo Anthony after averaging 16.5 PPG, 2.5 RPG, and 5.3 APG in 51 games in Denver that season.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG1: David Thompson (1975-82)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 4x All-Star, 2x All-Star Game MVP, 1975-76 Rookie of the Year, 2x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-ABA 2nd Team

Stats: 24.1 PPG, 4.3 RPG, 3.4 APG, 1.1 SPG, 0.9 SPG

David Thompson would have been one of the NBA’s all-time greats had it not been for cocaine, and he was so elite in his prime that Michael Jordan looked up to him when he was growing up. Despite the drug issues, Thompson was an elite scorer during his seven seasons with the Denver Nuggets. In his first season, which was played in the ABA, Thompson went onto the scene as a flashy rookie as he averaged 26 PPG, 6.3 RPG, 3.7 APG, 1.6 SPG, and 1.2 BPG while making the All-ABA 2nd Team. After the Nuggets moved into the NBA in 1976, Thompson made the All-Star team in each of the three seasons after that merger as he averaged 25.7 PPG, 4.2 RPG, 3.9 APG, 1.2 SPG, and 1 BPG while making the All-NBA 1st Team in two of those seasons. However, Thompson injured his foot during the 1979-80 season after averaging 21.5 PPG in 39 games that year. Although Thompson did average 25.5 PPG, 3.7 RPG, and 3 APG in the 1980-81 season, his career was never the same after that foot injury because it took away a lot of his athleticism and got him addicted to cocaine. Thompson was traded to the Sonics after a mediocre 1981-82 season, but he has gotten his life back on track today after dealing with drugs towards the end of his career.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG2: Ralph Simpson (1970-76, 1978)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 5x All-Star, 1x All-ABA 1st Team, 2x All-ABA 2nd Team

Stats: 19.5 PPG, 4.3 RPG, 3.8 APG, 1.7 SPG, 0.2 BPG

Ralph Simpson was a really good shooting guard during his six-and-a-half seasons with the Denver Nuggets. After averaging 14.2 PPG in 22.5 MPG during his rookie season, Simpson was really good in his next two seasons as he averaged 25.4 PPG, 4.7 RPG, 2.9 APG, and 1.6 SPG during that span while making the All-Star team both times. After averaging 18.7 PPG in his fourth year, Simpson’s assist numbers went up over the final two ABA seasons as he made the All-Star team both times and averaged 19.3 PPG, 5.1 RPG, 6.3 APG, and 1.9 SPG during that span. Before the 1976-77 season, which was the Nuggets first season in the NBA, Simpson was traded to the Detroit Pistons, but he returned to Denver during the following season. He averaged just 5.5 PPG in 32 games before being traded to the 76ers during the 1978 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF1: Alex English (1980-90)**

Accolades w/Team: 8x All-Star, 3x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 25.9 PPG, 5.6 RPG, 4.4 APG, 1 SPG, 0.7 BPG

Alex English was the leading scorer of the 1980s as well as a very underrated all-time great while spending a little over ten seasons playing for the Denver Nuggets. After averaging 11.6 PPG and 5.8 RPG in his first three-and-a-half seasons with the Bucks and Pacers, English was traded to the Nuggets during the middle of the 1979-80 season and averaged 21.3 PPG and 9.4 RPG in 24 games for them that year. After that small 24 game stretch, English improved in his first full season with the Nuggets as he averaged 23.8 PPG and 8 RPG in 81 games. After that season, English averaged at least 25 PPG in each of the next eight seasons as he averaged 27.3 PPG, 5.4 RPG, and 4.7 APG during that span while making the All-Star team in each of those seasons, being selected to an All-NBA team thrice, and never playing in less than 80 games in any of those seasons. After the 1989-90 season where English averaged 17.9 PPG, he signed with the Dallas Mavericks, but he left the Denver Nuggets with the most points and assists in franchise history, both of which he still holds today.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF2: Carmelo Anthony (2003-11)**

Accolades w/Team: 4x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 3x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 24.8 PPG, 6.3 RPG, 3.1 APG, 1.1 SPG, 0.5 BPG

Drafted third overall by the Denver Nuggets in the 2003 NBA Draft, Carmelo Anthony played seven-and-a-half productive seasons in the Mile High City. In his first two years, Melo averaged 20.9 PPG and 5.9 RPG during that span while helping the Nuggets make the playoffs both times. Like the aforementioned Alex English in the 1980s, Melo emerged as one of the league’s best scorers in the 2000s over the next five seasons as he averaged 26.4 PPG, 6.3 RPG, and 3.3 APG while making the All-Star team thrice, making an All-NBA team four times, and averaging at least 25 PPG four times during that five-year span on Nuggets teams that made the playoffs in each of those seasons. Anthony continued to score really well for the Nuggets in the 2010-11 season, averaging 25.2 PPG, 7.6 RPG, and 2.8 APG in 50 games with the team while making his fourth All-Star team before being traded to the New York Knicks during that season.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF3: Kiki Vandeweghe (1980-84)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star

Stats: 23.3 PPG, 5.3 RPG, 2.7 APG, 0.7 SPG, 0.5 BPG

Kiki Vandeweghe was an exceptional scorer during his four seasons with the Denver Nuggets. After being drafted 11th overall by the Dallas Mavericks in the 1980 NBA Draft, Vandeweghe held out for two months before being traded to the Nuggets in December. In the 51 games he played in his rookie year, Kiki averaged 11.5 PPG and 5.3 RPG and increased that output in his sophomore season as he averaged 21.5 PPG, 5.6 RPG, and 3 APG. Vandeweghe blossomed into an elite scorer in his next two seasons with the Nuggets as he averaged 28 PPG, 5.1 RPG, and 2.8 APG during that span while making the All-Star team both times. However, Vandeweghe’s defense was horrible, unlike his scoring, and he was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers after the 1983-84 season in a deal that sent Fat Lever to the Nuggets.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF1: Dan Issel (1975-85)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 2x All-Star, 1x All-ABA 2nd Team

Stats: 20.7 PPG, 8.3 RPG, 2.5 APG, 1 SPG, 0.6 BPG

Dan Issel spent five years with the Kentucky Colonels where he averaged 26.2 PPG and 10.8 RPG before being traded to the Denver Nuggets before the 1975-76 season, where he’d spend the final ten years of his professional basketball career. Issel had an excellent first season with the team as he averaged 23 PPG and 11 RPG while making the All-ABA 2nd Team and helping the Nuggets reach the ABA Finals. After the ABA-NBA merger in the 1976 offseason, Issel continued with his excellent play in his first NBA season as he averaged 22.3 PPG and 8.8 RPG while making another All-Star team. Although Issel was never selected to another All-Star game, he was still really good in his next seven seasons as he averaged 21.2 PPG and 8.3 RPG during that span while averaging at least 19.5 PPG in six of those seasons. After averaging just 12.8 PPG and 4.3 RPG in the 1984-85 season, Issel retired from playing after ten years in the Mile High City.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF2: Bobby Jones (1974-78)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 3x All-Star, 1x All-ABA 2nd Team, 4x All-Defensive 1st Team

Stats: 14.8 PPG, 8.6 RPG, 3.5 APG, 2 SPG, 1.9 BPG

Bobby Jones was a stalworth on the defensive end of the court during his four seasons with the Denver Nuggets. Jones had a really good rookie year as he averaged 14.8 PPG, 8.2 RPG, 3.6 APG, 2 SPG, and 1.8 BPG while making the first of his four All-Defensive 1st Team selections with the team. His second season was even better as he averaged 14.9 PPG, 9.5 RPG, 4 APG, 2 SPG, and 2.2 BPG while making his first of three All-Star selections with the team and helping the Nuggets make the ABA Finals. After the ABA-NBA merger in the 1976 offseason, Jones picked up where he left off in the NBA as he averaged 15.1 PPG, 8.3 RPG, 3.2 APG, 2.3 SPG, and 2 BPG in the 1976-77 season, which made him the first of two players to average at least 2 SPG and 2 BPG in back-to-back seasons. After averaging 14.5 PPG, 8.5 RPG, 3.4 APG, 1.8 SPG, and 1.7 BPG next year, Jones was traded to the 76ers during the 1978 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF3: Antonio McDyess (1995-97, 1999-02)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 18.2 PPG, 9 RPG, 1.6 APG, 0.9 SPG, 1.7 BPG

Drafted second overall in the 1995 NBA Draft, Antonio McDyess spent a little over five seasons with the Denver Nuggets. McDyess was good in his first two seasons as he averaged 15.8 PPG, 7.4 RPG, and 1.6 BPG during that span before being traded to the Phoenix Suns before the 1997-98 season. However, McDyess returned to the Nuggets as a free agent during the offseason after that 1997-98 season, and he averaged 20.2 PPG, 10.3 RPG, and 1.8 BPG over the next three seasons while making the All-NBA 3rd Team once and the All-Star team another time in that span. Sadly, McDyess missed all but ten games during the 2001-02 season due to a knee injury, and he was traded to the New York Knicks after that season.

&amp;#x200B;

**C1: Dikembe Mutombo (1991-96)**

Accolades w/Team: 3x All-Star, 1994-95 Defensive Player of the Year, 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 12.9 PPG, 12.3 RPG, 1.7 APG, 0.6 SPG, 3.8 BPG

Drafted fourth overall in the 1991 NBA Draft, Dikembe Mutombo was an elite interior defender during his five seasons with the Denver Nuggets. Mutombo thrived in his rookie year as he averaged 16.6 PPG, 12.3 RPG, and 3 BPG while making the All-Star team. After averaging 13.8 PPG and 13 RPG in his sophomore season, he led the Nuggets to the playoffs for the first time since he arrived in Denver in the 1993-94 season as he averaged 12 PPG, 11.8 RPG, and 4.1 BPG. He even helped the eighth-seeded Nuggets upset the first-seeded Sonics in the first round of the 1994 postseason as he averaged 12.6 PPG, 12.2 RPG, and 6.2 BPG in five games. Mutombo made the All-Star team in each of his next two seasons as he averaged 11.3 PPG, 12.2 RPG, and 4.2 BPG during that span while leading the NBA in blocks per game in both seasons. After the 1995-96 season, Mutombo signed with the Atlanta Hawks in free agency during the 1996 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**C2: Nikola Jokic (2015-)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 1st Team

Nikola Jokic has been really good in his four seasons with the Denver Nuggets so far. Drafted 41st overall in the 2014 NBA Draft, Jokic joined the Nuggets before the 2015-16 season, and he averaged 10 PPG and 7 RPG in his rookie season. He would improve over the next two seasons as he emerged as an excellent all-around big man as he averaged 17.6 PPG, 10.3 RPG, and 5.5 APG during that span. However, this past season would be a big one for Big Honey as he emerged as arguably the NBA’s best center as he averaged 20.1 PPG, 10.8 RPG, and 7.3 APG which resulted in him making the All-Star team for the first time, making the All-NBA 1st Team, and helping the Nuggets make the playoffs for the first time since 2013. Jokic looks to improve even more heading into next season on a Nuggets team that is one of the top teams in the Western Conference.

&amp;#x200B;

**C3: Marcus Camby (2002-08)**

Accolades w/Team: 2006-07 Defensive Player of the Year, 2x All-Defensive 1st Team, 2x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 10.1 PPG, 11.1 RPG, 2.5 APG, 1.1 SPG, 3 BPG

Marcus Camby didn’t stick out offensively, but he was a really good defensive center during his six seasons with the Denver Nuggets. Acquired by the Nuggets after the 2001-02 season, Camby played in just 29 games in his first season with the team and averaged just 7.6 PPG and 7.2 RPG during that span. However, Camby improved in his second season with the team as he averaged 8.6 PPG, 10.1 RPG, and 2.6 BPG while starting for the team and helping the Nuggets make the playoffs. Over the next four seasons, Camby emerged as one of the best shot blockers in the NBA despite being on the wrong side of 30 on all of those seasons as he averaged 10.7 PPG, 11.7 RPG, and 3.3 BPG during that span while making an All-Defensive team in each of those seasons. Although Camby led the NBA in blocks in each of his final three seasons, he was traded to the Clippers during the 2008 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**C4: Byron Beck (1967-77)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 2x All-Star

Stats: 11.5 PPG, 7 RPG, 1.3 APG, 0.6 SPG, 0.1 BPG

From the University of Denver, Byron Beck was a very good big man during his ten seasons with the Denver Nuggets/Rockets. After averaging 9.4 PPG and 7.9 RPG in his rookie season, Beck improved over the next three seasons as he averaged 13.6 PPG and 10.4 RPG during that span. However, after his fourth season, his rebounding began to decline, but he was still a solid scorer over the next five seasons as he averaged 11.6 PPG and 5.6 RPG during that span. After the 1975-76 season, the Nuggets moved into the NBA in the 1976 offseason as a result of the ABA merger, and Beck played one season in the NBA while averaging just 4.7 PPG before retiring after the 1976-77 season.

**TL;DR All-Time Nuggets Roster**

||Starters|Reserves|

|PG|**Lafayette ""Fat"" Lever**|Larry Jones, Chauncey Billups|
|SG|**David Thompson**|Ralph Sampson|
|SF|**Alex English**|Carmelo Anthony, Kiki Vandeweghe|

|C|**Dikembe Mutombo**|Nikola Jokic, Marcus Camby, Byron Beck|
||*Head Coach*|*Assistant Coaches*|
|Coaching Staff|George Karl|Doug Moe, Larry Brown|

**Analysis**

* This is a really good starting lineup. At point guard, Fat Lever was an all-around player as he had no real weaknesses. He could make plays, rebound, defend, and had a decent three-point shot. He is surrounded by really good scorers like David Thompson and Alex English. The frontcourt is really good as Issel could score on the inside and Mutombo could defend really well inside as an elite shot-blocker while both guys were really good rebounders.
* On the second unit, there are a lot of very good playmakers with Larry Jones, Ralph Simpson, and Jokic. All of those guys were pretty good scorers as well in addition to exceptional all-around scorer Carmelo Anthony. With all these four guys offensively in the second unit, Bobby Jones won't have much of a role offensively but his defense will definitely bolster this bench lineup.

So I decided to make one for defense since it is often overlooked. 

The goal is to make a starting 5 that can play the best defense together. Which means great defense as a team. It doesn't mean you put together the best defenders at every position and call it a day, although that might be a viable strategy in some cases. Also any team worth it's salt on defense has to be adaptable to different types of offenses. 

(Optional) Since defense is very dependent on potential matchups, feel free to include a 6th man who can slot into the starting lineup in some matchups. 

I'll put a starting 5 with expaanation below to get us started. I want to see what starting lineups you guys come up with and how you explain your choices so that we can all learn. 

PG: Sidney Moncrief
SG: Kawhi Leonard
SF: LeBron James
PF: Kevin Garnett
C: Hakeem Olajuwon 
6th: Draymond Green

Explanation: 

This lineup is extremely versatile with great individual and help defenders. Additionally, the team has excellent rebounding too. 

Moncrief was a scary good defender for a guard and was very good at shotblocking and help defense too. I have only seen highlights and I am putting him here based on his reputation and highlights. 

Kawhi Leonard when engaged is a scary defender. He has great length, good strength, big hands, and excellent footwork and fundamentals. In his Spurs days, he could embarrass some opposing players with his defense. His defense during that period was amazing. 

LeBron is kinda forgotten as a defender but he was really good in his prime too. He was capable of excellent perimeter defense while also being a great help defender. Help defense is very important imo since players will get beaten 1 on 1 regardless of how good they are. 

KG is KG. He was just uniquely great. He could protect the rim, defend players in the post and on the perimeter, and he was quick for his size. One of the best defenders ever, possibly the best. 

Hakeem is one of the best defenders at the center spot and he was very dominant in the post and also surprisingly fast for his size. He was dominating some of the best centers of his era on defense and that era had some very good centers. Hakeem racked up blocks and steals, which is rare for centers. He'd do pretty well in today's game where zone defense is allowed. This one is based on highlights and reputation too since that was before my time as well. 

Draymond is here for his overall defensive intelligence and ability. He is perfect for the modern game due to his switchability and reads on defense. KG can move to the 5 against small ball lineups while Draymond slots in at the 4. This is not required, but will improve the defense a lot against teams which are perimeter oriented and target slower bigs (Hakeem is mobile for a center but relatively slow compared to guards).

What five players on a team together could put up the highest scoring numbers? I feel like this is an interesting discussion because you can't just choose the 5 best individual scorers, you have to construct a team that would work well together to dominate any team's defense.  Plus, factor in that today the game is moving away from strict, traditional positions and you could potentially play a lineup featuring more than one player from a given position.  There are many key questions that can be dissected for this.  Do you go for a small-ball lineup with elite shooting, or do you play more dominant bigs that don't necessarily need the ball in their hands to score? Do you put Steph Curry as point guard for his shooting and spacing, or Magic for his passing?

I think my list would look something like:

1. Steph Curry
2. Michael Jordan
3. Larry Bird
4. Tim Duncan
5. Shaq

Again, this is purely for offensive potency, not an All-Time squad overall.

Rules are as usual; 2-4 players at each position, players are included based on their tenure with the team, and I can move players out of position if I feel that's what's best for the team but I can only move them one position up or down (which means I can't move LeBron from SF to PG when the All-Time Heat comes up). I don't do this a majority of the times, but I do have cases where I move a few players around (I moved one player to a different position on this team but this is because if I put that player at his primary position, I would have crossed the four-player limit for a position. Plus, the position I moved him to needed more depth). Anyways, onto the All-Time 76ers squad.

**PG1: Allen Iverson (1996-06, 2009-10)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x NBA MVP, 8x All-Star, 2x All-Star Game MVP, 1996-97 Rookie of the Year, 3x All-NBA 1st Team, 3x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 27.6 PPG, 3.9 RPG, 6.1 APG, 2.3 SPG, 0.2 BPG

Despite standing at just six feet tall, Allen Iverson was an elite guard during the 2000s and one of the best ball handlers in NBA history. Drafted first overall by the 76ers in the 1996 NBA Draft, Iverson was very good in his first two seasons as 22.7 PPG, 3.9 RPG, 6.8 APG, and 2.1 SPG during that span which included the Rookie of the Year award in his first year. However, Iverson never made the All-Star team in those first two years, but he had a huge third year as he averaged 26.8 PPG, 4.9 RPG, 4.6 APG, and 2.3 SPG while making the All-NBA 1st Team and helping the 76ers make the playoffs for the first time in Iverson’s career. After another All-NBA season in the 1999-00 season, Iverson had a huge 2000-01 season where he averaged 31.1 PPG, 3.8 RPG, 4.6 RPG, and 2.5 SPG, won the NBA’s MVP and helped carry the 76ers to that year’s NBA Finals. After that MVP season, Iverson continued his All-Star play as he averaged 29.9 PPG, 3.9 RPG, 6.6 APG, and 2.5 SPG over the next five seasons. However, the team didn’t maintain its success from 2001, and after averaging 31.2 PPG, 7.3 APG, and 2.2 SPG in 15 games for the team in the 2006-07 season, he was traded to the Nuggets during that season.

&amp;#x200B;

**PG2: Maurice Cheeks (1978-89)**

Accolades w/Team: 3 Finals Appearances, 1x NBA Champion, 4x All-Star, 4x All-Defensive 1st Team, 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 12.2 PPG, 3 RPG, 7.3 APG, 2.3 SPG, 0.3 BPG

Mo Cheeks was an excellent defensive point guard and an important player during his eleven seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers. Drafted in the second round of the 1978 NBA Draft, Cheeks was solid in his first four seasons as he averaged 10.1 PPG, 3.2 RPG, 6.9 APG, and 2.4 SPG. However, Cheeks improved in his fifth season as he averaged 12.5 PPG, 2.6 RPG, 6.9 APG, and 2.3 SPG while making the All-Star team, All-Defensive 1st Team, and helping the 76ers win an NBA championship that year. After two more very good seasons where he averaged 12.9 PPG, 2.8 RPG, 6.4 APG, and 2.2 SPG during that span, Cheeks made the All-Star team in each of the three seasons after that as he averaged 14.9 PPG, 3.1 RPG, 8.4 APG, and 2.4 SPG during that span. After another solid season where he averaged 11.6 PPG and 7.8 APG, Cheeks was traded to the Spurs during the 1989 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG1: Hal Greer (1958-73)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x NBA Champion, 10x All-Star, 1968 All-Star Game MVP, 7x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 19.2 PPG, 5 RPG, 4 APG

Hal Greer was one of the NBA’s top guards during the 1960s. As a 76ers lifer who played 15 years with the franchise, Greer was drafted 13th overall by the franchise back when they were known as the Syracuse Nationals in the 1958 NBA Draft. Greer was solid in his first two seasons as he averaged 12.2 PPG, 3.6 RPG, and 2.1 APG during that span, but he had a breakout season in his third season as he averaged 19.6 PPG, 5.8 RPG, and 3.8 APG while making the All-Star team for the first time. Greer maintained that scoring production as over the next nine seasons, each of them being All-Star selections, he averaged 22.2 PPG, 5.6 RPG, and 4.5 APG during that span which included helping the 76ers win an NBA championship in 1967. Greer was important to that championship run as he averaged 27.7 PPG, 5.9 RPG, and 5.3 APG in 15 games during the 1967 postseason. After Greer averaged 18.6 PPG during the 1970-71 season, he played in just two more seasons as he averaged 9.9 PPG during that span before retiring as the all-time leading scorer of the 76ers.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG2: Andrew Toney (1980-88)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 1x NBA Champion, 2x All-Star

Stats: 15.9 PPG, 2.2 RPG, 4.2 APG, 0.8 SPG, 0.2 BPG

Andrew Toney’s career was shortened to just eight seasons due to horrible foot problems, but he was really good at scoring for most of his playing career. Toney was very good in his first two seasons while coming off the bench as he averaged 14.8 PPG and 3.7 APG during that span which included an incredible performance against the Celtics in the 1982 Eastern Conference Finals as he averaged 22.1 PPG in seven games. Toney continued to thrive over the next two seasons, both of which resulted in All-Star selections, as he averaged 20 PPG, 2.6 RPG, and 4.6 APG during that span which included helping the 76ers win an NBA championship in 1983. After averaging 17.8 PPG and 5.2 APG in the 1984-85 season, Toney dealt with foot problems as he missed all but six games in the 1985-86 season. Including that season, Toney averaged just 9 PPG in his final three seasons before retiring due to those foot injuries.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG3: Doug Collins (1973-81)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 4x All-Star

Stats: 17.9 PPG, 3.2 RPG, 3.3 APG, 1.2 SPG, 0.3 BPG

Doug Collins had leg injuries that limited him to just eight seasons, but he was a really good scorer at the shooting guard position for the 76ers during the 1970s. Drafted first overall in the 1973 NBA Draft, Collins had a mediocre rookie season as he averaged 8 PPG on 17.4 MPG while playing in just 25 games that season. However, he showed improvement in his sophomore season as he averaged 17.9 PPG, 3.9 RPG, and 2.6 APG in 81 games that season. Collins made the All-Star in each of the next four seasons, despite two of those being shortened due to injury, as he averaged 19.7 PPG, 3.3 RPG, and 3.7 APG. Collins’s injury issues started during the last of those four All-Star selections, the 1978-79 season, and he played in just 48 games over the next two seasons as he averaged 13.4 PPG during that span before retiring at just 29 years old.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG4: Andre Iguodala (2004-12)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star, 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 15.3 PPG, 5.8 RPG, 4.9 APG, 1.7 SPG, 0.5 BPG

Andre Iguodala was a very good player during his eight-year stint with the Philadelphia 76ers. Drafted ninth overall in the 2004 NBA Draft, Iggy was solid in his first two seasons as he averaged 10.7 PPG, 5.8 RPG, and 3.1 APG during that span. However, Iguodala improved his scoring over his next three seasons due to the Allen Iverson trade as he averaged 19 PPG, 5.6 RPG, and 5.2 APG during that span. Iguodala’s scoring load decreased in his final three seasons with the team, but he was still averaging 14.8 PPG, 6.1 RPG, and 5.8 APG during that span while making his first All-Defensive team in the 2010-11 season followed by his first All-Star selection the following year. After that 2011-12 All-Star campaign, Iguodala was sent to the Nuggets during the 2012 offseason in the blockbuster, four-team deal that sent Dwight Howard to the Lakers.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF1: Julius Erving (1976-87)**

Accolades w/Team: 4 Finals Appearances, 1x NBA Champion, 1x NBA MVP, 11x All-Star, 2x All-Star Game MVP, 5x All-NBA 1st Team, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 22 PPG, 6.7 RPG, 3.9 APG, 1.8 SPG, 1.5 BPG

Julius Erving was a phenomenal player during his 11 years with the Philadelphia 76ers as he was selected to the All-Star team in each of those seasons. Acquired by the 76ers in 1976, Dr. J thrived immediately in his first NBA season, after five seasons in the ABA, as he averaged 21.6 PPG, 8.5 RPG, 3.7 APG, 1.9 SPG, and 1.4 BPG while helping the Sixers reach the NBA Finals that year. An athletic all-around player, Erving maintained that production over the next seven seasons as he averaged 23.4 PPG, 7.1 RPG, 4.1 APG, 1.9 SPG, and 1.7 BPG during that span while making an All-NBA team in six of those seven seasons, helping the Sixers make the NBA Finals three more times, and helping the franchise win an NBA championship in 1983. Although he was still an All-Star in each of his final three seasons, Erving was slowing down as his averages during that final span went down to 18.4 PPG, 4.9 RPG, 3.2 APG, 1.5 SPG, and 1.3 BPG. Dr. J was such a flashy player with his dunks and athleticism, and he could do it all with the 76ers from scoring, rebounding, defending, and helping the franchise win a lot of games.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF2: Billy Cunningham (1965-72, 1974-76)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x NBA Champion, 4x All-Star, 3x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 20.8 PPG, 10.1 RPG, 4 APG, 1.2 SPG, 0.5 BPG

Drafted fifth overall by the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1965 NBA Draft, Billy “The Kangaroo Kid” Cunningham was a really good player during his nine seasons with the franchise. As a role player in his first three seasons with the team, Cunningham averaged 17.2 PPG, 7.4 RPG, and 2.5 APG during that span while coming off the bench on 76ers teams that were contenders. After Wilt Chamberlain was traded to the Lakers, Cunningham broke out in the 1968-69 season as he averaged 24.8 PPG, 12.8 RPG, and 3.5 APG while making the All-NBA 1st Team. During the next three seasons, Cunningham continued with his impressive play as he averaged 24.1 PPG, 12.5 RPG, and 5 APG during that span while making an All-NBA Team in each of those seasons. After the 1971-72 season, Cunningham left the 76ers to play in the ABA for two seasons, but he returned to the Sixers in the 1974-75 season where he averaged 18.4 PPG, 8.7 RPG, and 5.5 APG during his final two seasons before retiring 20 games into the 1975-76 season due to injury.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF3: Chet Walker (1962-69)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x NBA Champion, 3x All-Star

Stats: 16.2 PPG, 7.9 RPG, 1.8 APG

Chet Walker didn’t reach his peak until he got to the Chicago Bulls, but he was still a very good player during his seven years with the Philadelphia 76ers. After averaging 12.3 PPG and 7.2 RPG during his rookie season, Walker improved in his sophomore season as he averaged 17.3 PPG and 10.3 RPG en route to his first All-Star selection. Walker did take a step back in his third season as he averaged 13.2 PPG and 6.7 RPG, but he was a key role player on the 76ers teams that contended over the next four seasons as he averaged 17.6 PPG and 7.8 RPG during that span which included two All-Star selections and helping the Sixers win an NBA championship in 1967. After the 1968-69 season, Walker was traded to the Bulls during the 1969 offseason where he’d spend the second half of his career.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF1: Charles Barkley (1984-92)**

Accolades w/Team: 6x All-Star, 1991 All-Star Game MVP, 4x All-NBA 1st Team, 3x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 23.3 PPG, 11.6 RPG, 3.7 APG, 1.7 SPG, 1 BPG

Charles Barkley spent the first half of his career with the Philadelphia 76ers, was a really good player in his eight years with the team, and excelled on the boards despite being 6’6” as a power forward. Drafted fifth overall in the 1984 NBA Draft, Barkley was solid in his rookie year as he averaged 14 PPG and 8.6 RPG while being the fourth option on the team. However, he improved in his second season as he averaged 20 PPG, 12.8 RPG, 3.9 APG, 2.2 SPG, and 1.6 SPG and made the All-NBA 2nd Team. After the franchise traded Moses Malone after the 1985-86 season, “The Round Mound of Rebound” became the leader of the 76ers and remained one of the best power forwards in the game over the next six seasons while making an All-NBA team in each of those seasons as he averaged 25.5 PPG, 11.9 RPG, 4 APG, 1.6 SPG, and 0.9 BPG during that span. Although he was a very strong rebounder, the 76ers finished with a losing record in the 1991-92 season, and Barkley was traded to the Phoenix Suns during the 1992 offseason after demanding a trade.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF2: Dolph Schayes (1949-64)**

Accolades w/Team: 3 Finals Appearances, 1x NBA Champion, 12x All-Star, 6x All-NBA 1st Team, 6x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 18.5 PPG, 12.1 RPG, 3.1 APG

Dolph Schayes was a really good all-around star during the early days of the NBA, and he played all 15 of his seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers franchise, although 14 of them were spent in Syracuse. Schayes was really good in his first two seasons in the NBA as he averaged 16.9 PPG, 16.4 RPG, and 3.9 APG during that span. Although his stats declined a little in his third season as he averaged just 13.8 PPG and 12.3 RPG, Schayes was much better in the next three seasons as he averaged 17.8 PPG, 12.5 RPG, and 3 APG while helping the Nationals win an NBA championship during the latter of those three years in 1955. During the 1955 NBA Finals, Schayes averaged 19 PPG, 11.9 RPG, and 3 APG in seven games against the Detroit Pistons. During the six seasons after that championship, Schayes thrived as one of the game’s best power forwards as he averaged 22.6 PPG, 13.1 RPG, and 3.1 APG during that span while making an All-NBA Team in each of those seasons. However, Schayes slowed down as he averaged 10.8 PPG and 6.3 RPG in his final three seasons before retiring after the 1963-64 season.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF3: Bobby Jones (1978-86)**

Accolades w/Team: 3 Finals Appearances, 1x NBA Champion, 2x All-Star, 1982-83 Sixth Man of the Year, 6x All-Defensive 1st Team, 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 10.7 PPG, 4.8 RPG, 2.2 APG, 1.2 SPG, 1.1 BPG

Although he wasn’t the best player offensively, Bobby Jones was a defensive stalworth during his eight years with the 76ers when they were contending during the early 1980s. During his first four seasons with the team, Jones averaged 13.2 PPG, 5.7 RPG, 2.4 APG, 1.3 SPG, and 1.3 BPG while making the All-Defensive 1st Team in each of those seasons and helping the 76ers make the NBA Finals two times in that span. However, Jones took a bench role for the 1982-83 season, and he averaged 9 PPG off the bench while making the All-Defensive 1st Team, winning the Sixth Man of the Year, and helping the Sixers win an NBA championship that year. Although Jones was still a really good defender in his final three seasons, he was getting older, and he averaged 7.6 PPG during that span before retiring after the 1985-86 season.

&amp;#x200B;

**C1: Wilt Chamberlain (1965-68)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x NBA Champion, 3x NBA MVP, 4x All-Star, 3x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 27.6 PPG, 23.9 RPG, 6.8 APG

Although the 7’1” Wilt Chamberlain only played four seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers, he was one of the most dominant players in the history of the NBA. He was acquired during the 1964-65 season by the Sixers, and he averaged 30.1 PPG and 22.3 RPG in 35 games for the team that season. Wilt played his first full season with the 76ers the following year as he averaged 33.5 PPG, 24.6 RPG, and 5.2 APG while making the All-NBA 1st Team. Wilt dominated the following year as well as he averaged 24.1 PPG, 24.2 RPG, and 7.8 APG while finally getting off the schneid against Bill Russell and the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference and helping the Sixers win an NBA championship that year as he averaged 17.7 PPG, 28.5 RPG, and 6.8 APG in five NBA Finals games against the San Francisco Warriors. Wilt continued to play really well the following year as he averaged 24.3 PPG, 23.8 RPG, and 8.6 APG, but he lost to Russell’s Celtics in that year’s Eastern Conference Finals, and he was traded to the Lakers during the 1968 offseason after demanding a trade. Despite this, his dominance was clear on the court as he won three MVPs in four years with the 76ers.

&amp;#x200B;

**C2: Moses Malone (1982-86, 1993-94)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x NBA Champion, 1x Finals MVP, 1x NBA MVP, 4x All-Star, 2x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-Defensive 1st Team

Stats: 21 PPG, 12 RPG, 1.3 APG, 0.9 SPG, 1.3 BPG

Acquired by the 76ers before the 1982-83 season, Moses Malone thrived in his four seasons in his first stint with the franchise. Although his stats declined in his first season compared to his past few years in Houston, he was dominant as he averaged 24.5 PPG, 15.3 RPG, and 2 BPG while winning the NBA’s MVP and helping the Sixers win the NBA championship that year as Malone won the Finals MVP as he averaged 25.8 PPG and 18 RPG in four NBA Finals games against the Los Angeles Lakers. Even though Malone’s first season with the 76ers would be the apex of his tenure with that team, he would still be a dominant All-Star over the next three seasons as he averaged 23.7 PPG and 12.7 RPG during that span. After the 1985-86 season, Malone would be traded to the Washington Bullets, but he’d return to the Sixers for the 1993-94 season, and although he only averaged 5.3 PPG, he was there to mentor Shawn Bradley.

**C3: Joel Embiid (2016-)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team, 2x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 24.3 PPG, 11.4 RPG, 3.2 RPG, 0.7 SPG, 2 BPG

Joel Embiid has been a very dominant center during his three years with the 76ers so far. Drafted third overall by the 76ers in the 2014 NBA Draft, he didn’t play his first game until the 2016-17 season due to foot injuries. He only played in 31 games in his rookie year due to knee injuries, but he was dominant in those games as he averaged 20.2 PPG, 7.8 RPG, and 2.5 BPG. After that rookie year, Embiid improved in his second season as he averaged 22.9 PPG, 11 RPG, 3.2 APG, and 1.8 BPG while making the All-NBA 2nd Team and helping the Sixers make the playoffs for the first time since “The Process era” started. Embiid continued to improve even more this past season as he averaged 27.5 PPG, 13.6 RPG, 3.7 APG, and 1.9 BPG while making the All-NBA 2nd Team again and helping the Sixers make the second round of the 2019 postseason before losing to the eventual champion Raptors in seven games on a buzzer-beater. Despite this heartbreaking loss, Embiid looks to improve even more in his fourth season after improving in each of his first three.

**TL;DR All-Time 76ers Roster**

||Starters|Reserves|
|:-|:-|:-|
|PG|**Allen Iverson**|Maurice Cheeks|
|SG|**Hal Greer**|Andrew Toney, Doug Collins, Andre Iguodala|
|SF|**Julius Erving**|Billy Cunningham, Chet Walker|
|PF|**Charles Barkley**|Dolph Schayes, Bobby Jones|
|C|**Wilt Chamberlain**|Moses Malone, Joel Embiid|
||*Head Coach*|*Assistant Coaches*|
|Coaching Staff|Billy Cunningham|Al Cervi, Alex Hannum|

**Analysis**

* In the starting five, there are lots of scorers as all five guys put up at least 20 PPG during their peak season with the team. At PG, Iverson was an excellent scorer, driver, ballhandler, and playmaker. Iverson was always considered a selfish player, but I feel like he will be much less selfish with a much better supporting cast around him as he can pass it to Greer on the outside or to Erving, Barkley, or Wilt in transition for a dunk. Defensively, Erving was very good and Wilt was a dominant shot blocker. Rebounding is another strength for this team as they have two of the greatest rebounders in Barkley and Wilt.
* On the second unit, Mo Cheeks was a really good playmaker and defender. He has lots of scorers around him to pass to off the bench as Toney, Cunningham, Schayes, and Malone all put up at least 20 PPG in their peak season. Not only does this second unit have a lot of scorers, but it also has a lot of really good rebounders as Schayes, Cunningham, and Malone all put up at least 10 RPG during their best seasons with the 76ers.

That season he had blown voters away by being the first player since Oscar Robinson in 1962 to average a triple double. This could be simplified by saying “in the modern era of basketball.”

The beating of the record and the emergence as a true historical season seemed to lock Westbrook for MVP at that exact point in time. However, not only has Westbrook done it again, but he has done it for three consecutive seasons. He was not a top three finalist in either of the following seasons.

And before you mention record or the more conditional aspects of the award, the Thunder finished 6th in the West his MVP season, further leading me to believe that this was a more statistical merit (at least, more than usual, as Westbrook was still obviously the rock to his team)

Sure, the emergence of the triple double has been more than notable in the modern NBA: From the 1991–92 to the 2014–15 season, there were only 841 triple-doubles, or about 35.04 triple-doubles per season. In the 2015–16 season, the number of triple-doubles recorded in the NBA grew from 46 to 75. From the 2016–17 to the 2018–19 season, the NBA recorded 352 triple doubles.

However, it still cannot help but seem that Westbrook in a way outdid himself. Especially after the season Harden just had, it makes Westbrook’s case that much more curious. What do you think?

Playmaking Guard - Slasher, Great Playmaker. e.g. Westbrook, Kyrie, DSJ etc.

Left Wing / Right Wing - Operate near the hash, good catch and shoot 3pt shooters and good passers. e.g. PG, Eric Gordon, Ellington.

Left Big / Right Big - Run down opposite sides of the court and defend cutters from each wing and slashers from each wing. On offense their main role is to catch lobs and space to the midrange on each side. e.g. Aldridge, Harrell.

The primary playbook option would be for the Playmaker to bring the ball up to the logo and find one of the knockdown wing guards, where if open can shoot a 3 or pass to a big for a chance at an easier shot. By doing this they can relieve pressure from people guarding them by finding a man or simply take an easy 3.

If a defense guards the explosive, slashing guard at the logo, he can call a screen from one of the bigs (whichever side) and blow by in an open lane due to the two wing guards stretching the defense, and attack the rim.

If the defense sags off the playmaking Guard and allows him space, he can move to the 3pt line where the wing guards spot up in the corner and one of the bigs goes under the hoop for a lob opportunity, while one sets a screen for a blow by.

**PG1: Don Buse (1972-77, 1980-82)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 1x ABA Champion, 2x All-Star, 1x All-ABA 2nd Team, 3x All-Defensive 1st Team

Stats: 7.7 PPG, 3 RPG, 5.1 APG, 2.5 SPG, 0.3 BPG

As a basketball player from the state of Indiana, Don Buse had a really good seven-year stint with the Indiana Pacers. Buse averaged 5.4 PPG over his first two seasons, but he got the starting point guard role in his third season. He only averaged 6.5 PPG, but he averaged 2.1 SPG while making the All-Defensive 1st Team. The season after that, Buse had his best season yet as he averaged 12.5 PPG, 3.8 RPG, a league-leading 8.2 APG and 4.1 SPG (which is still a record) en route to an All-NBA 2nd Team and All-Defensive 1st Team selection. The Pacers moved into the NBA, and Buse continued to thrive as a defensive point guard in his first NBA season as he averaged 8 PPG, 3.3 RPG, a league-leading 8.5 APG, and 3.5 SPG to make another All-Star team. Buse would be traded during the 1977 offseason to the Phoenix Suns, but he returned to Indiana for a second stint in 1980 which is most notable as Buse led the NBA in three-pointers during the 1981-82 season with 73.

**PG2: Freddie Lewis (1967-74, 1976-77)**

Accolades w/Team: 4 Finals Appearances, 3x ABA Champion, 1x Playoffs MVP, 3x All-Star

Stats: 16.1 PPG, 3.9 RPG, 4 APG, 1.1 SPG, 0.1 BPG

After averaging 4.7 PPG in just 10.4 MPG during his rookie season with the Cincinnati Royals, Freddie Lewis found a new opportunity in the ABA when he signed with the Indiana Pacers during the 1967 offseason. Lewis immediately thrived in the new and upstart league as he averaged 20.5 PPG, 5.3 RPG, and 3.4 APG during his first two seasons while making the All-Star team in 1968. Although his scoring role was slightly reduced after those two seasons, Lewis was still a very good player over the next four seasons with the Pacers as he averaged 16.4 PPG, 3.8 RPG, and 4.4 APG while making the All-Star team two times and helping the Pacers win three ABA championships during that span. Lewis even was the MVP of the ABA Playoffs in their 1972 championship run as he averaged 22.8 PPG in six ABA Finals games against the New York Nets. After averaging 9.9 PPG in the 1973-74 season, Lewis was traded to the Memphis Sounds during the 1974 offseason, but he returned to the Pacers in the 1976-77 season before retiring.

**SG1: Reggie Miller (1987-05)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 5x All-Star, 3x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 18.2 PPG, 3 RPG, 3 APG, 1.1 SPG, 0.2 BPG

Reggie Miller is arguably the greatest Indiana Pacer of all-time as he played 18 really good seasons with the franchise. Drafted 11th overall by the 1987 NBA Draft, Miller was solid in his first two seasons as he averaged 12.8 PPG during that season. However, Miller broke out in his third NBA season as he averaged 24.6 PPG, 3.6 RPG, and 3.8 APG while shooting 41.4% from three on 4.4 attempts per game and making his first All-Star team. Miller remained one of the best shooting guards in the Eastern Conference over the next 11 seasons as he averaged 20.2 PPG, 3.1 RPG, and 3.1 APG during that span while shooting 40% from the three-point line on 5 attempts per game. During that span, the Knick killer made the All-Star team an additional four times, made the All-NBA 3rd Team three times, led the NBA in three-pointers made during two of those 11 seasons, and helped lead the Pacers to the NBA Finals in 2000. Although Miller’s production did decline a little after the 2000-01 season, he was still solid in his final four seasons with the team as he averaged 13.4 PPG during that span while on playoff teams in each of those four seasons. Reggie Miller is one of the NBA’s greatest three-point shooters of all-time as he has the second-most three-pointers made in NBA history.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG2: Billy Knight (1974-77, 1979-83)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 2x All-Star, 1x All-ABA 1st Team

Stats: 18.4 PPG, 5.9 RPG, 2.4 APG, 1.1 SPG, 0.2 BPG

Billy Knight was a really good player with his seven-and-a-half seasons with the Pacers. During his first season with the Pacers, Knight was a very good player as he averaged 17.1 PPG and 7.9 RPG while helping the franchise reach the NBA Finals that year. Knight improved even more in his second season as he averaged 28.1 PPG, 10.1 RPG, and 3.7 APG en route to a selection on the All-ABA 1st Team. When the Pacers moved into the NBA from the ABA, Knight continued to be an All-Star as he averaged 26.6 PPG, 7.5 RPG, and 3.3 APG during his third season.  Knight was traded after the 1976-77 season to the Buffalo Braves, but he returned to the Pacers during the 1978-79 season where he averaged 14.7 PPG in 39 games for his first half-season in his second tour in Indiana. Knight averaged 15.1 PPG in the four seasons after that, and he was traded yet again before the 1983-84 season.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG3: Victor Oladipo (2017-)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team, 1x All-Defensive 1st Team

Stats: 21.7 PPG, 5.3 RPG, 4.6 APG, 2.1 SPG, 0.6 BPG

Victor Oladipo has only played two seasons with the Pacers so far, but he has been really good in both of those seasons. Acquired by the Pacers as a part of the trade that sent Paul George to the OKC Thunder, Oladipo had underachieved in his first four seasons in the NBA despite being picked second overall. People viewed the trade as a robbery by the Thunder, but Oladipo quickly proved the doubters wrong as he averaged 23.1 PPG, 5.2 RPG, 4.3 APG, and 2.4 SPG which helped him make the All-Star team, All-NBA 3rd Team, and All-Defensive 1st Team, win the Most Improved Player award, and the Pacers make the playoffs despite low expectations heading into the season. Oladipo averaged 18.8 PPG, 5.6 RPG, and 5.2 APG just this past season in 36 games before rupturing his quad, but he was still an All-Star. Heading into the 2019-20 season, Oladipo looks to improve after his season ended early last year.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF1: Paul George (2010-17)**

Accolades w/Team: 4x All-Star, 3x All-NBA 3rd Team, 1x All-Defensive 1st Team, 2x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 18.1 PPG, 6.3 RPG, 3.2 APG, 1.7 SPG, 0.4 BPG

Drafted tenth overall in the 2010 NBA Draft, Paul George was a really good player during his seven-year stint with the Indiana Pacers. After averaging 10 PPG and 4.7 RPG during his first two seasons in the NBA, George improved a lot in his third season in the NBA as he averaged 17.4 PPG, 7.6 RPG, 4.1 APG, and 1.8 SPG en route to his first All-Star selection as well as that year’s Most Improved Player as he helped the Pacers make the Eastern Conference Finals. His fourth season would be even better as he averaged 21.7 PPG, 6.8 RPG, 3.5 APG, and 1.9 SPG which helped him make the All-NBA 3rd Team yet again. Although George missed all but six of the games in the 2014-15 due to a fractured leg suffered during a scrimmage in summer of 2014, George bounced back very nicely over the next two seasons as he made the All-Star team both teams and averaged 23.4 PPG, 6.8 RPG, 3.7 APG, and 1.7 SPG during that span. However, George demanded a trade, and his request was granted after the 2016-17 as he was traded to the OKC Thunder.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF2: Roger Brown (1967-74, 1975)**

Accolades w/Team: 5 Finals Appearances, 3x ABA Champion, 1x Playoffs MVP, 4x All-Star, 1x All-ABA 1st Team, 2x All-ABA 2nd Team

Stats: 18 PPG, 6.5 RPG, 4 APG, 0.7 SPG, 0.7 BPG

Roger Brown did not play professional basketball until he was 25 years old, but he was really good for the ABA’s Indiana Pacers for a little more than seven seasons. Brown’s professional career started really well as in his first two seasons, he averaged 20.3 PPG, 7.7 RPG, and 4.5 APG during that span while making the All-Star team in his first. However, Brown would have his best season in the 1969-70 season as he averaged 23 PPG, 7.4 RPG, 4.7 APG en route to another All-Star selection and an ABA Championship for the Pacers where Brown won the MVP of the playoffs as he averaged 32.7 PPG in six games against the L.A. Stars. After that season, Brown would have two more All-Star seasons in the next two years as he averaged 19.6 PPG, 6.7 RPG, and 4.4 APG during that span, and also helped the Pacers win two more ABA championships in 1972 and 1973. After averaging 12.2 PPG in his final two seasons of his first stint with the team, Brown signed with the Memphis Sounds. He did return to the Pacers mid-way through that season after being waived, but he retired after that season.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF3: Ron Artest (2002-06)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star, 2003-04 Defensive Player of the Year, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team, 2x All-Defensive 1st Team, 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 16.5 PPG, 5.2 RPG, 3 APG, 2.2 SPG, 0.7 BPG

The former Ron Artest only played in a total of 193 games for the Indiana Pacers over five different seasons, but he was really good when he was on the floor. Artest was acquired by the Pacers mid-way through the 2001-02 season, but he was solid in 28 games with the team as he averaged 10.9 PPG, 5 RPG, and 2.4 SPG. Artest improved in the 2002-03 season as his averages went up to 15.5 PPG, 5.2 RPG, 2.9 APG, and 2.3 SPG while making the All-Defensive 2nd Team. However, Artest had a big season the following year as he averaged 18.3 PPG, 5.3 RPG, 3.7 APG, and 2.1 SPG which helped him make the All-Star team for the first time and win that year’s Defensive Player of the Year. After that incredible 2004-05 season, it seemed like Artest would have an even bigger season as he averaged 24.6 PPG, 6.4 RPG, and 3.1 APG in the first six games of the 2004-05 season. However, the Malice at the Palace rolled around, which caused a huge brawl and for Artest to be suspended for the remainder of that season. He would return for the 2005-06 season while averaging 19.4 PPG, 4.9 RPG, and 2.6 SPG in 16 games before being traded to the Sacramento Kings in the middle of that season.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF4: Danny Granger (2005-14)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star

Stats: 17.6 PPG, 5.1 RPG, 2 APG, 1 SPG, 0.9 BPG

Danny Granger was a really good player for the Pacers in his eight-and-a-half years with the franchise. Drafted 17th overall in the 2005 NBA Draft, Granger improved in each of his first three seasons as he averaged 7.5 PPG in his rookie year, 13.9 PPG in his second season, and 19.6 PPG and 6.1 RPG during his third season. However, Granger had a huge breakout year in his fourth season as he averaged 25.8 PPG, 5.1 RPG, 2.7 APG, 1 SPG, and 1.4 BPG during that 2008-09 season while making the All-Star team for the first time and winning that year’s Most Improved Player. While Granger would never reach those numbers again, he was still very good over the next three seasons as he averaged 21.1 PPG, 5.3 RPG, and 2.4 APG during that span before a knee injury limited Granger to five games during the 2012-13 season. Granger would return for the 2013-14 season, but it was clear he was nowhere near where he once was, and he was traded to the 76ers during the middle of that season.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF1: George McGinnis (1971-75, 1980-82)**

Accolades w/Team: 3 Finals Appearances, 2x ABA Champion, 1x Playoffs MVP, 1x ABA MVP, 3x All-Star, 2x All-ABA 1st Team, 1x All-ABA 2nd Team

Stats: 19.6 PPG, 10.7 RPG, 3.3 APG, 1.8 SPG, 0.5 BPG’

After McGinnis averaged 30 PPG and 14.7 RPG in his sophomore season at Indiana University, the Indiana Pacers were really enamored by the young power forward and signed him when he was just 20 years old. McGinnis was a pretty good player during his rookie season with the team as he averaged 16.9 PPG and 9.7 RPG while helping the Pacers win the ABA championship. McGinnis saw an increased role over the next two seasons as he averaged 26.7 PPG, 13.7 RPG, and 2 SPG during that span while being selected to the All-Star team and an All-ABA Team in each of those two seasons and even helped the Pacers win another ABA championship in 1973 as McGinnis won the Playoffs MVP as he averaged 22.3 PPG in seven ABA Finals games against the Kentucky Colonels. McGinnis improved even more in the 1974-75 season as he averaged a league-leading 29.8 PPG, 14.3 RPG, 6.3 APG, and 2.6 SPG which helped him the ABA’s MVP that season. McGinnis was so good that he moved onto the NBA with the 76ers a year before the merger between the two leagues. McGinnis returned to the Pacers in the middle of the 1979-80 season, but he was past his prime, and the Pacers would regret this trade as they sent future All-Star Alex English to the Nuggets in that deal.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF2: Jermaine O’Neal (2000-08)**

Accolades w/Team: 6x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 2x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 18.6 PPG, 9.6 RPG, 2 APG, 0.7 SPG, 2.4 BPG

Jermaine O’Neal was a really good big man during his eight seasons with the Indiana Pacers. O’Neal averaged just 3.9 PPG in his first four seasons with the Portland Trail Blazers before the Pacers acquired him in a trade in 2000. O’Neal improved in his first year with Indiana as he averaged 12.9 PPG, 9.8 RPG, and 2.8 BPG, and showed even more improvement in his second season with the team as he averaged 19 PPG, 10.5 RPG, and 2.3 BPG while winning the Most Improved Player and making it to the All-NBA 3rd Team. O’Neal would continue his All-Star production over his next two seasons as he averaged 20.4 PPG, 10.2 RPG, and 2.4 BPG during that span while making an All-NBA team in each of those seasons. Even though O’Neal dealt with various injuries (and a suspension during the 2004-05 season during the Malice at the Palace) during each of the next three seasons, he was still an All-Star in each of them as he averaged 20.9 PPG, 9.3 RPG, and 2.4 BPG during that span. After the 2007-08 season where he played in just 42 games and averaged 13.6 PPG, O’Neal would be traded to the Toronto Raptors.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF3: Dale Davis (1991-00, 2005)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x All-Star

Stats: 9.3 PPG, 9 RPG, 0.9 APG, 0.7 SPG, 1.3 BPG

Dale Davis was a solid big man during his ten years with the Indiana Pacers. After being drafted 13th overall by the Pacers in the 1991 NBA Draft, Davis had a solid rookie season where he averaged 6.2 PPG and 6.4 RPG while playing off the bench for a majority of his games. After that rookie season, Davis was a consistent big man over the next eight seasons as he averaged 9.8 PPG and 9.2 RPG during that span. Interestingly, Davis never averaged above 11.7 PPG or below 8 PPG during each of those eight seasons. After the 1999-00 season, Davis was traded to the Trail Blazers for Jermaine O’Neal, but he returned during the 2004-05 season as a free agent after O’Neal got injured.

&amp;#x200B;

**C1: Mel Daniels (1968-74)**

Accolades w/Team: 4 Finals Appearances, 3x ABA Champion, 2x ABA MVP, 6x All-Star, 1971 All-Star Game MVP, 3x All-ABA 1st Team, 1x All-ABA 2nd Team

Stats: 19.4 PPG, 16 RPG, 1.9 APG, 0.7 SPG, 1.6 BPG

Mel Daniels was a very dominant center during his six-year stint with the Indiana Pacers while they were in the ABA. After being acquired by the Pacers from the Minnesota Muskies after the 1967-68 season, Daniels was arguably the best center in the ABA during his first three seasons with the team as he averaged 21.2 PPG and 17.4 RPG during that span while making the All-ABA 1st Team in each of those seasons, leading the ABA in rebounding twice in that span, and winning two ABA MVPs in those three years. Even though Mel Daniels wasn’t as elite in the second half of his Pacers tenure as he was in his first, he was still an All-Star in each of those three years in that span as he averaged 17.7 PPG and 14.5 RPG during those three seasons. Even though Daniels moved onto the Memphis Sounds after the 1973-74 season, he was still very impactful for the Indiana Pacers as he won three ABA championships with them as their starting center.

&amp;#x200B;

**C2: Rik Smits (1988-00)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x All-Star

Stats: 14.8 PPG, 6.1 RPG, 1.4 APG, 0.4 SPG, 1.3 BPG

Rik Smits was a very good center during his 12-year tenure with the Indiana Pacers. Drafted second overall in the 1988 NBA Draft, Smits was a consistent player in the post-game. He averaged 14.8 PPG and 6.1 RPG during his entire career while never averaging below 10.9 PPG in a single season while never averaging above 18.5 PPG in one season. During that span, he also never averaged below 4.7 RPG, but never above 7.7 RPG in a single season. Smits’s accolades during his career aren’t impressive, but they include an All-Star selection and an NBA Finals appearance in 2000 before retiring after that 1999-00 season.

&amp;#x200B;

**C3: Bob Netolicky (1967-72, 1973-75)**

Accolades w/Team: 4 Finals Appearances, 2x ABA Champion, 4x All-Star, 1x All-ABA 2nd Team

Stats: 15.7 PPG, 8.9 RPG, 1.1 APG, 0.3 SPG, 0.3 BPG

Bob Netolicky was a very good big man during his eight-year stay with the Indiana Pacers while they were in the ABA. Netolicky was an All-Star in each of his first four seasons in the ABA as he averaged 18.7 PPG and 10.4 RPG during that span which includes a season when he made the All-ABA 2nd Team. After averaging 15.1 PPG and 9.2 RPG during the 1971-72 season, Netolicky was traded to the Dallas Chaparrals. However, Netolicky returned to the Pacers via trade during the very next season. He was not the same player in his second stint that he was in his first tenure with the team as he averaged just 9.1 PPG in 56 games during the 1973-74 season followed by just 7.5 PPG and 4.8 PPG during the next two seasons before retiring.

**TL;DR All-Time Pacers Roster**

||Starters|Reserves|
|:-|:-|:-|
|PG|**Don Buse**|Freddie Lewis|
|SG|**Reggie Miller**|Billy Knight, Victor Oladipo|
|SF|**Paul George**|Roger Brown, Ron Artest, Danny Granger|
|PF|**George McGinnis**|Jermaine O'Neal, Dale Davis|
|C|**Mel Daniels**|Rik Smits, Bob Netolicky|
||*Head Coach*|*Assistant Coaches*|
|Coaching Staff|Slick Leonard|Frank Vogel, Larry Bird|

**Analysis**

* Don Buse isn't as big of a name as some of the other starting point guards on these All-Time teams, but he was a tenacious defender who also excelled at playmaking and shooting three-pointers. He is surrounded by excellent sharpshooter Reggie Miller, dominant inside scorer Mel Daniels, and two all-around scorers in Paul George and George McGinnis. While Miller and McGinnis weren't that good defensively, Paul George is an excellent perimeter defender and Mel Daniels is a very good inside defender for this starting five.
* Off the bench, there are lots of scorers with Lewis, Knight, Brown, and O'Neal all averaging at least 20 PPG during their best seasons with the Pacers. Lewis and Brown weren't the best playmakers, but they are going to be solid playmakers in the second unit. Although Smits isn't the best rebounder for a backup center, he still will score pretty easily in the post with his 7'4"" frame. Also, Knight and O'Neal will get the boards for the second unit considering they both averaged at least 10 RPG during their best season with the team.

Vegas usually does a pretty good job, overall, of projecting win totals. We will take each team's schedule, and multiply their opponent's projected win percentage by the game type (number of rest days &amp; game location, average record based on last season's results). By taking the average of all 82 games it will give us rest adjusted strength of schedule (higher RASOS = more difficult schedule). Seeing as each team plays different types of opponents due to conferences and divisions, we will subtract RASOS from every team's raw SOS (based on projected record of teams played). This will give us the difference, which we will call Rest Adjustment Differential, or RAD. A higher RAD means that the team has a more favorable schedule due to rest days.

 **TLDR - Anthony Davis relies heavily on other players setting him up for scoring looks, more so than pretty much any other top player (as evidenced by % of made 2-pt FG that are assisted).  This lack of shot creating ability may mean he is not quite as good as many people think.**

I'll preface this by saying that Anthony Davis is obviously a tremendously skilled player, and one of the best players in the NBA.  He is incredibly athletic for someone of his size, is a very good defender, has a better jumper than most big men, and has consistently put up an efficient 24+ points per game.  This is not a post made to hate on him; it's simply an explanation of why, in my opinion, he may not be as good as most people think.

For all of AD's obvious strengths, one important thing that I've noticed he's not elite at is creating his own shot.  Not that he can't do it, but I believe he relies on others to set him up to score more than other top players do.  This is evidenced by the fact that a large percentage of his made field goals are assisted, significantly more than other players of his caliber.

I did not use ""% of made 3-pt FG that are assisted,"" because (a) AD did not attempt very many 3PT field goals, and (b) for most players in the league (with the exception of players like Curry, Harden, Lillard, etc.), most of their made 3-pointers are assisted.

All data is from basketballreference.com.

Quite a large percentage of his made 2-point shots have been assisted, indicating that Davis relies on others setting up his scoring looks for him (rather than creating scoring looks for himself).

As you can see, Anthony Davis' ""% of made 2-pt FG that are assisted"" is significantly higher than any of these players.  This is true when comparing him to pretty much any high scoring player that I haven't listed (just to name a few more: Giannis last year - 47.2%; Durant last year - 47.1%; Paul George last year - 31.1%).  I believe this shows that AD is not as good at creating his own scoring opportunities as other stars.

Now I could be wrong; there could be a legitimate explanation for this that I'm not thinking of.  Maybe this is because Davis is a great PnR man, because he's a lethal lob threat, or because he's a smart player who gets himself open a lot.  And this doesn't mean that Davis won't ever improve his ability to create his own scoring looks.  This past season was his lowest percentage yet (61.8%) by a significant margin, and other players listed were quite reliant on others to create looks for them early in their careers (Aldridge his first two seasons, Griffin his first 5 or 6 seasons).  But given how much higher AD's ""% of made 2-pt FG that are assisted"" is relative to other elite players, I think this possibly indicates that he's not as good of a shot creator as other stars, and that, IMO, means he may not be quite as good as many seem to think (i.e., top-5 player in the NBA).  

This is just one stat, though.  Anthony Davis is still an incredible talent, and is still a top-10 player in this league.  And even if this does mean he's not the greatest at creating clean scoring looks, that shouldn't matter too much next season when he's playing alongside LeBron James, arguably the greatest playmaker of all time.",True,False,,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,64034,public,self,Why Anthony Davis Might Not Be As Good As You Think,0,1566486777,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cti80h/why_anthony_davis_might_not_be_as_good_as_you/,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Lakers need to clinch their stance as the best team in the league and the best way to do so is to acquire a guard who can serve as a third option and be a good fit next LeBron.

This led me to start looking through teams and trying to see what other players I felt this way about and I found a good number of players who, like Randle, I could see myself seeing a considerable range of stances on them being viable given their past supporting cast limitations. I don't want to list off all my players to avoid tainting the results below so I'll just stick with mentioning Randle in my post and will hopefully chime in on others that show up in the comments.

To explain what I mean using my example above, I dont think I can accurately assess Julius Randle until I see him paired with a big who can stretch the floor on the offensive end allowing him to act as the team's primary interior big, but then have his partner act as the primary rim protector letting Randle cover the opponent's 4. The closest player he's shared the floor with would likely be Nikola Mirotic, but I would like to see him with a Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, or Dewayne Dedmond type player. Then I think it would be pretty clear what level of player Randle is capable of being.

I have to believe other people feel this way about some NBA guys too and I'm curious who everyone else thinks has plenty of room for interpretation to where if they get paired with the right player archetype(s) then we might consider them a completely different player than we do now.

I was interested in scoring rates and total points of some of the most prolific scorers in the NBA today versus some of the previous greats, so I plotted the data together so I could visualize the comparison. Please note, I didn't put a ton of effort into visualization, but if anyone has some ideas for making the data easier to see, I'd be interested to hear them.

[Here are the plots](https://imgur.com/qwBUk8a). On the top is ppg by age, and on the bottom is cumulative points by age.

A few takeaways:

* Lebron is obviously on pace to break Kareem's all-time scoring record, which is no surprise. In addition to being an all-time great player, his physical endurance is what sets him apart among this company, as he hasn't really had a down year due to injury, and looks like he can keep outputting at a respectable rate for years to come
* KD just about kept pace with Lebron, except for his one injured year, and will likely fall further behind after next year.
* In addition to retiring early, Wilt also started much later than most of the players here, not entering the NBA until he was 23 years old.
* James Harden also got a slow start, but has caught up to the pack with his massive scorint surge after being traded to Houston.
* Was Giannis' inclusion in this plot preemptive? If he has the same durability as Lebron, he could be on pace to be a top-10 all-time scorer.

Rules are as usual; 2-4 players at each position, players are included based on their tenure with the team, and I can move players out of position if I feel that's what's best for the team but I can only move them one position up or down (which means I can't move LeBron from SF to PG when the All-Time Heat comes up). I don't do this a majority of the times, but I do have cases where I move a few players around (like this Magic team, I moved 3 players to different but similar positions). Anyways, onto the All-Time Magic squad.

**Head Coach: Stan Van Gundy (2007-12)**

Accolades w/Team: 259-135 Regular Season Record, 31-28 Playoff Record, 1 Finals Appearance

**Assistant Coach: Brian Hill (1993-97, 2005-07)**

Accolades w/Team: 267-192 Regular Season Record, 18-22 Playoff Record, 1 Finals Appearance

**Assistant Coach: Doc Rivers (1999-03)**

Accolades w/Team: 171-168 Regular Season Record, 5-10 Playoff Record

&amp;#x200B;

**PG1: Anfernee Hardaway (1993-99)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 4x All-Star, 2x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 19 PPG, 4.7 RPG, 6.3 APG, 1.9 SPG, 0.5 BPG

Drafted third overall in the 1993 NBA Draft, Anfernee Hardaway was one of the NBA’s best point guards during his six-year stint with the Magic. He was very good in his rookie season as he averaged 16 PPG, 5.4 RPG, and 6.6 APG, but he emerged as one of the NBA’s elite superstars over the two seasons after his rookie year. During those two seasons, Penny averaged 21.3 PPG, 4.3 RPG, 7.1 APG, and 1.9 SPG during that span while making the All-NBA 1st Team both times and helping lead the Magic to the NBA Finals in 1995. The Magic lost Penny’s co-star Shaquille O’Neal in the 1996 offseason, and Penny was the star of the Magic heading into the 1996-97 season. Hardaway only played in 59 games that season due to injury, but he was still really good as he averaged 20.5 PPG, 4.5 RPG, and 5.6 APG while making the All-NBA 3rd Team. However, Hardaway suffered a horrible knee injury early in the following season, and he was never the same player after that. As a result, he was traded to the Phoenix Suns during the 1999 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**PG2: Jameer Nelson (2004-14)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x All-Star

Stats: 12.6 PPG, 3.1 RPG, 5.4 APG, 1 SPG, 0.1 BPG

Jameer Nelson was a very good point guard for ten seasons with the Magic. After being drafted 20th overall in the 2004 NBA Draft, Nelson was solid in his first four seasons in the NBA with averages of 11.7 PPG, 3 RPG, and 4.4 APG during that span. However, Nelson made the All-Star team in the 2008-09 season as he averaged 16.7 PPG, 3.5 RPG, and 5.4 APG while shooting 45.3% from three on 4.3 attempts per game in 42 games before a torn labrum ended his season. Nelson was never an All-Star after that, but he was still solid in his final five seasons with the Magic while averaging 12.8 PPG, 3.2 RPG, and 6.3 APG before being waived after the 2013-14 season.

&amp;#x200B;

**PG3: Darrell Armstrong (1994-03)**

Accolades w/Team: 1998-99 Sixth Man of the Year

Stats: 11.7 PPG, 3.3 RPG, 5.1 APG, 1.7 SPG, 0.1 BPG

Darrell Armstrong didn’t play in the NBA until April of 1995 when he was 26 years old, playing for the Orlando Magic. However, he was very solid in his nine-year stint with the franchise. After averaging just 6.9 PPG in 17.5 MPG over his first four seasons, Armstrong improved in the 1998-99 season as he averaged 13.8 PPG, 3.6 RPG, 6.7 APG, and 2.2 SPG which helped him the Sixth Man of the Year and the Most Improved Player that season. Armstrong played better over the next two seasons as he averaged 16 PPG, 3.9 RPG, 6.5 APG, and 1.9 SPG during that span. After averaging 10.9 PPG over the two seasons after that, Armstrong decided to sign with the New Orleans Hornets as a free agent.

&amp;#x200B;

**PG4: Scott Skiles (1989-94)**

Stats: 12.9 PPG, 2.9 RPG, 7.2 APG, 0.9 SPG

Scott Skiles was a member of the Orlando Magic during their inaugural season and spent five very solid seasons with the team. After Skiles averaged 7.7 PPG and 4.8 APG in his first season with the team, he improved a lot in the 1990-91 season as he averaged 17.2 PPG and 8.4 APG which helped him win Most Improved Player that year. During that season, Skiles set a record for most assists in an NBA game with 30 in a game against the Denver Nuggets, a record that still stands today. Skiles remained the starting point guard over the next two seasons, averaging 14.8 PPG and 8.4 APG during that span. However, he was overtaken by Penny Hardaway as the starting point guard during the 1993-94 season, and he was traded to the Washington Bullets after that season.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG1: Tracy McGrady (2000-04)**

Accolades w/Team: 4x All-Star, 2x All-NBA 1st Team, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 28.1 PPG, 7 RPG, 5.2 APG, 1.5 SPG, 1 BPG

Tracy McGrady only played in four seasons with the Orlando Magic but was so magnificent in each of those four seasons. After three seasons with the Raptors, McGrady signed with the Magic in the 2000 offseason and thrived immediately as he averaged 26.8 PPG, 7.5 RPG, 4.6 APG, 1.5 SPG, and 1.5 BPG during the 2000-01 season which helped him make the All-NBA 2nd Team and win the Most Improved Player award. After another All-NBA season in the 2001-02 season in which he averaged 25.6 PPG, 7.9 RPG, 5.3 APG, 1.6 SPG, and 1 BPG, T-Mac had a huge 2002-03 season where he averaged a league-leading 32.1 PPG, 6.5 RPG, 5.5 APG, 1.7 SPG, and 0.8 BPG while being selected to the All-NBA 1st Team for the second time. Although McGrady had a really good 2003-04 season where he averaged 28 PPG, 6 RPG, 5.5 APG, and 1.4 SPG and made the All-NBA 2nd Team, the Magic won just 21 games, and McGrady was traded to the Rockets in the 2004 offseason after demanding a trade.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG2: Nick Anderson (1989-99)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance

Stats: 15.4 PPG, 5.3 RPG, 2.8 APG, 1.5 SPG, 0.5 BPG

As the first draft pick in the history of the Orlando Magic, Nick Anderson was a very good player during his ten-year stay with the franchise. After averaging 12.7 PPG in his first two seasons in the NBA, Anderson thrived over the next two seasons as he averaged 19.9 PPG, 6.2 RPG, 3.1 APG, and 1.6 SPG during that span while also shooting 35.3% from three on 2.4 attempts per game. Although Anderson’s role was reduced after the Magic got Penny Hardaway, he was still important to the team as he averaged 15.8 PPG, 5.2 RPG, 3.9 APG, and 1.6 SPG while shooting 37.6% from three on 4.7 attempts per game during that span. However, Anderson is most known for missing four consecutive free throws in Game 1 of the 1995 NBA Finals which helped the Rockets win that game as well as the entire series. Even though Anderson was never really the same player after that, he still had moments where he played like his old self. In the 27 games he played in after the All-Star break for the 1997-98 season, Anderson averaged 23.9 PPG, 6.1 RPG, 2.7 APG, and 1.7 SPG during that span. After the 1998-99 season, Anderson was traded to the Sacramento Kings.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG3: Dennis Scott (1990-97)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance

Stats: 14.8 PPG, 3.1 RPG, 2.3 APG, 1 SPG, 0.3 BPG

Sidenote: I will start mentioning this for when I decided to move a player’s position for an all-time team. I know Dennis Scott played SF, but for this team, I moved him to SG because I have other guys at SF and 3-D fits nicely at the 2 with his three-point shooting.

Drafted fourth overall in the 1990 NBA Draft, Dennis Scott was an exceptional three-point shooter during his seven-year stint with the Orlando Magic. During his rookie season, Scott was very good as he averaged 15.7 PPG while shooting 37.4% from three on 4.1 attempts per game. After playing in just 18 games in his sophomore season due to a knee injury, Scott was solid in his next three seasons as he averaged 13.7 PPG, shooting 41% from three on 5.1 attempts per game during that span. After helping lead the Magic to the 1995 NBA Finals, Scott had a really good 1995-96 season as he averaged 17.5 PPG, 3.8 RPG, and 3 APG while making 267 three-pointers in that season, which would be the record for the most threes in a season until the 2005-06 season. After averaging 12.5 PPG during the 1996-97 season, Scott would be traded to the Mavericks.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF1: Hedo Turkoglu (2004-09, 2010-13)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance

Stats: 14.5 PPG, 4.5 RPG, 3.9 APG, 0.9 SPG, 0.3 BPG

Hedo Turkoglu was a really good three-pointer during his eight-year stint with the Orlando Magic. After signing with the team in the 2004 offseason, Turkoglu was solid in his first three seasons as he averaged 14.1 PPG, 3.9 RPG, and 2.8 APG during that span in which he shot 39.1% from three on 3.7 attempts per game. However, Turkoglu continued to improve in the 2007-08 season as he averaged 19.5 PPG, 5.7 RPG, and 5 APG while shooting 40% from three on 5.1 attempts per game to help him win that year’s Most Improved Player. After another good season where he averaged 16.8 PPG, Turkoglu signed with the Raptors in the 2009 offseason, but he returned to the Magic during the 2010-11 season for a second stint that lasted for two-and-a-half seasons.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF2: Rashard Lewis (2007-10)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x All-Star

Stats: 16.3 PPG, 5.1 RPG, 2.1 APG, 1.1 SPG, 0.5 BPG

Sidenote: I know Rashard Lewis was a PF during his time with the Magic, but I moved him to SF for this all-time team because I need more SF depth and I have two PFs better than him on the team. Plus, SF was actually his natural position with his previous team, the Sonics.

Rashard Lewis signed with the Magic during the 2007 offseason, and he had four very good seasons with that team. During his first two seasons with the Magic, Lewis averaged 18 PPG, 5.6 RPG, 2.5 APG while shooting 40.3% from three-point range on 6.9 attempts per game during that span in which he made an All-Star and helped the Magic reach the NBA Finals in 2009. His role reduced slightly during the 2009-10 season, after the team got former All-Star Vince Carter, as Lewis averaged 14.1 PPG during that season while maintaining his really good three-point percentage. During the 2010-11 season, Lewis would be traded to the Washington Wizards for Gilbert Arenas after averaging 12.2 PPG in 25 games with the Magic.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF3: Grant Hill (2000-07)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star

Stats: 16.4 PPG, 5 RPG, 3.1 APG, 1.1 SPG, 0.4 BPG

While Grant Hill made the All-Star team two times in “six” seasons with the Magic, he was injured for a majority of his stint with the team. These are Grant Hill’s games played in each of his six seasons in Orlando: 4, 14, 29, 67, 21, 65. Hill was signed in 2000, intended to be paired with young and upcoming Tracy McGrady. However, Hill played in just 47 games during McGrady’s entire tenure with the team which lasted from 2000-04. When McGrady got traded in 2004, Hill made the All-Star team, this time in a more deserving fashion than he did during the 2000-01 season, as he averaged 19.7 PPG, 4.7 RPG, and 3.3 APG in 67 games. After only playing in 21 games during the 2005-06 season, Hill played in 65 games during his final season with the Magic while averaging 14.4 PPG before signing with the Suns during the 2007 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF1: Dwight Howard (2004-12)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 6x All-Star, 3x Defensive Player of the Year, 5x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team, 4x All-Defensive 1st Team, 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 18.4 PPG, 13 RPG, 1.5 APG, 1 SPG, 2.2 BPG

Sidenote: I know Dwight Howard played C during his best years with the Magic as well as a majority of his Magic tenure at that position, but I moved him to PF because the starting C for this all-time team is going to dominant paired with Dwight and the backup C is an All-Star as well. Plus, he did play PF at some point with the Magic and I’d much rather start him with Shaq than my backup PF for this team.

Drafted first overall by the Magic in the 2004 NBA Draft, Dwight Howard was one of the best NBA’s best big men during his eight-year stint with the Orlando Magic. After averaging 13.9 PPG and 11.3 RPG during his first two seasons in the NBA, Howard had a breakout season in the 2006-07 as he averaged 17.6 PPG, 12.3 RPG, and 1.9 BPG while making his first All-Star team as well as the All-NBA 3rd Team. After that really good 2006-07 season, Dwight continued to wreak havoc on opposing big men over the next five seasons as he averaged 20.6 PPG, 13.9 RPG, and 2.5 BPG during that span while also making the All-Star team and All-NBA 1st Team in each of those five seasons, winning the NBA’s Defensive Player of the Year three times, placing second in the MVP voting for the 2010-11 season, and leading the Magic to the NBA Finals in the 2009 season in those five years. However, Dwight Howard demanded a trade and the Magic complied with his request during the 2012 offseason with a trade that sent Howard to the Lakers which also involved the Nuggets and 76ers. Despite how Howard’s tenure ended, he is still arguably the greatest Orlando Magic player of all-time.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF2: Horace Grant (1994-99, 2001-02)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 2x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Horace Grant signed with the Magic during the 1994 offseason and played a little over six solid seasons with the franchise. Grant was a solid defensive presence for the Magic during the 1990s as he averaged 12.1 PPG, 8.7 RPG, 2.3 APG, 1.1 SPG, and 1.1 BPG during his first stint with the Magic that lasted five seasons while making the All-Defensive team twice and helping the Magic go to the NBA Finals once in 1995. Although he was traded to the Sonics after the 1999 season, Horace Grant returned to the Magic for the 2001-02 where he averaged 8 PPG and 6.3 RPG during his short second stint with the franchise.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF3: Aaron Gordon (2014-)**

Stats: 12.5 PPG, 6.2 RPG, 2.2 APG, 0.8 SPG, 0.6 BPG

Drafted fourth overall in the 2014 NBA Draft by the Orlando Magic, Aaron Gordon has been solid during his five seasons with the Magic so far. After averaging 7.7 PPG and 5.4 RPG during his first two seasons with the team which included being robbed from winning the 2016 Slam Dunk Contest, Gordon got his first opportunity as a starter in the 2016-17 season and averaged 12.7 PPG and 5.1 RPG. Gordon’s last two seasons have been pretty good as he has averaged 16.7 PPG, 7.6 RPG, and 3.1 APG during that span and is even shooting three-pointers pretty well, shooting 34.3% from long range over the last two seasons on 5.1 attempts per game in addition to his high-flying dunks.

&amp;#x200B;

**C1: Shaquille O’Neal (1992-96)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 4x All-Star, 1992-93 Rookie of the Year, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 2x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 27.2 PPG, 12.5 RPG, 2.4 APG, 0.8 SPG, 2.8 BPG

Drafted first overall by the Orlando Magic in the 1992 NBA Draft, Shaquille O’Neal was a dominant center during his four seasons in Orlando. During his rookie year, Shaq was already dominating as he averaged 23.4 PPG, 13.9 RPG, and 3.5 BPG while making the All-Star team and winning the Rookie of the Year. Shaq showed even more improvement in his sophomore season as he averaged 29.3 PPG (which would have led the NBA had it not been for David Robinson scoring 71 in the final game of the season), 13.2 RPG, and 2.9 BPG en route to another All-Star selection. Shaq followed that season up with a 1994-95 season where he led the NBA in scoring with 29.3 PPG, 11.4 RPG, 2.7 APG, and 2.4 BPG en route to his third All-Star selection, placing second in MVP voting and a Finals appearance for the Magic. Although Shaq’s fourth season with the Magic was shortened to 54 games due to injury, he was still dominant as he averaged 26.6 PPG and 11 RPG with a fourth All-Star selection. After that season, Shaq signed with the Lakers, but he was still magnificent with the Magic in his four seasons there.

&amp;#x200B;

**C2: Nikola Vucevic (2012-)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star

Stats: 16.8 PPG, 10.7 RPG, 2.6 APG, 0.9 SPG, 1 BPG

Nikola Vucevic has been a really good center during his seven-year stint with the Magic so far. Acquired by the Magic in the four-team trade that sent Dwight Howard to the Lakers, Vucevic was solid in his first two seasons as he averaged 13.6 PPG and 11.5 RPG during that span. However, Vucevic improved in the two seasons after that as he averaged 18.8 PPG and 10 RPG during that span. While he did drop off a bit in the two seasons after that span as he averaged 15.4 PPG and 9.9 RPG from 2016-18, Vucevic had his best season just this past season. He averaged 20.8 PPG and 12 RPG while shooting 36.4% from three on 2.9 attempts per game which helped him make the All-Star team and helped the Magic reach the postseason for the first time since they had Dwight Howard.

**Analysis**

* I love the starting lineup for this all-time team. The two-headed monster of Shaq and Dwight will terrorize opponents in the paint both offensively and defensively. Sure, neither guy could shoot any jumpers to save his life, but I like the spacing around both players. While Penny and T-Mac were both phenomenal slashers, Penny was a decent three-point shooter and playmaker while McGrady, along with small forward Hedo Turkoglu, were really good three-point shooters.
* The second unit is stacked with three-point shooters. Nelson, Anderson, Lewis, and Vucevic were all very good three-point shooters during their best years with the Magic. Like the starters, there isn't a lot of perimeter defense, but I like the post defense for the backups. Horace Grant was a really good defender as he made two All-Defensive teams and Vooch is an underrated defender in the NBA today as he just helped lead the Magic to a Top 5 defense this past season.
* Sidenote: In NBA 2k19, the All-Time Orlando Magic with Penny, T-Mac, Shaq, and Dwight is one of the most fun teams to use in the game as of now. I pre-ordered NBA 2k20 and I cannot wait to use that lineup when that game comes out in early September.

In general, pundits seem to just say it, without actually justifying it.

For the purpose of this discussion, I will not count KD among the league's best players, because he isn't going to be playing this year. But, even with him out, to anyone who thinks that Anthony Davis is a top 5 player, which two of the following players would you say that he is better than:

Kawhi Leonard: My pick for current best player on the planet. Reigning Finals MVP, and the best player on the team that just won the chip. He had an all-time level playoff run and, frankly, I probably don't need to discuss too much about why this dude deserves to be top 5.

LeBron James: His accomplishments include being LeBron James.

Steph Curry: Two time MVP, led a team to a 73 win season in the last half decade, has been in the Finals the last 5 years, and has won three of them. Greatest shooter to ever live. 

James Harden: Top two in MVP voting for the past 3 years. Led the league in win shares this past year. Won the scoring title this past year by over 8 points a game.

Giannis Antetokounmpo: Reigning league MVP. Carried the Bucks to the league's best record with Khris Middleton as his second best player. Anchored the league's top defence, and was a runner up for DPOY. Was top 2 (along with Harden), in pretty much every advanced stat that people care about (1st in WS/48, 2nd in BPM, 2nd in VORP, etc). An all-around beast on both sides of the ball.

Nikola Jokic: Anchored a young and chronically injured Denver team to the 2 seed in the West. Third in the league in value over replacement player (Harden #1 at 9.9, Giannis #2 at 7.6, Jokic at #3 at 7.3, while #4 was Gobert, way back at 5.9). Actually had the best advanced stats in this year's playoffs, beating everyone, including Kawhi, in WS/48 and BPM. Won more playoff games this year than Davis has in his career.

In addition to these 6, other players with a viable claim to being a top 5 or, at least, top 10 players, include Damian Lillard (4th in win shares this year, 5th the year before, and carried his Blazers to 53 wins and a Conference Finals), Paul George (3rd in MVP voting this year and 5th in win shares), and human triple-double machine Russell Westbrook.

Now, let's get to Anthony Davis' career:

In 7 years in New Orleans, he has led the Pelicans to a grand total of two playoff appearances, wherein they won a grand total of 5 games. In 5 of those 7 seasons, the Pelicans were worse than .500, and in none of those seasons did they win 50 games. Davis didn't have a superteam next to him, but he did have some pretty good players like Jrue Holiday, Nikola Mirotic, pre-injury DeMarcus Cousins, Ryan Anderson, Eric Gordon, Tyreke Evans, Buddy Hield, etc, who played on those teams.

On an individual level, don't get me wrong, Davis is an excellent player, but he has never won an MVP like Giannis, LeBron, Steph, Harden, or even Westbrook. He has no Finals MVP's on his resume like Kawhi does. PER loves AD, but other advanced stats are not nearly as favourable. He has only finished top 5 in the league in win shares twice (4th place in 2014-2015 and 4th place in 2017-2018). He has never finished top 5 in VORP. He has never finished top 5 in BPM. He has only finished top 5 in RPM once (4th place in 2014-2015).

Davis has the reputation as a top level defender, and while he is an excellent defender, his reputation there also exceeds his accomplishments, as he has never been the DPOY candidate that some say he is. While he gets a lot of blocks, his advanced defensive metrics have never been exceptional. He has been top 5 in defensive win shares twice (5th in 2016-2017, and 3rd in 2017-2018), but his DBPM has never been all that good. In the two years he was top 5 in defensive win shares, he was 17th and 16th in DBPM. The Pelicans also finished as the 10th and 14th best defence in the league in those two years.  

I mean, look, Anthony Davis is an excellent player. I consider him to be a top 10 player. But, with his resume, to date, I just don't see how you can viably put Davis above guys like Kawhi, LeBron, Harden, Steph, Giannis, or even guys like Jokic, Lillard and arguably Westbrook and George.

* We spend a lot of our time discussing and ranking players. This often leads to some repetitive debates. One of the issues is that we all rank players according to different things. Some people value spacing, some value defence, some value isolation scoring. The truth is there’s no concrete definitively correct answer. Whenever I see someone’s list though, it’s usually pretty obvious that **tiered rankings make a lot more sense**. When you’re talking about the top 99.99% of NBA players, the overall difference is minuscule, and a good week, or even a good game, from 1 player may be enough for them to leapfrog another player. Kawhi Leonard has blown up after winning the championship to the point where plenty of people ranked him as the best in the game, while a guy like James Harden, who actually had a very good playoffs, somehow fell as low as 7 on a lot of people’s lists.

* The best way I could think to assess players in to tiers was actually very simple. **A tier 1 player quite simply should be able to be the best player on a championship caliber team**. Now that’s a tough ask and a very high standard, but the problem is that a lot of people say things like “if you gave them the right supporting cast…”

* The clear problem with this is that the average NBA team doesn’t have perfect roster construction around a star player. Russell Westbrook is a brilliant NBA player, but without a perfect roster construction around him, it’s hard to imagine him being a #1 option of a championship contender.

* The solution I proposed was the simply tier players according to their role on a championship team. **A tier 2 player should be able to be the 2nd best player on a championship team, *given*, they have a tier 1 player on their team**. ie, on my list I have Damian Lillard as a tier 2 PG. Lillard has been the best player on Portland for a while now but has struggled to form a genuine contender. However, if you could give him a guy like Giannis or Durant as a running mate, suddenly he would almost certainly be a championship contender.

*  If you follow this logic we can say a guy like Marc Gasol may slide in to tier 4 as a center. **This means that if Gasol played alongside a tier 3, 2 and 1 player**, they would almost certainly be a championship contender.

* As a rule I have said that **any hypothetical team would be a contender in the current NBA environment**. That means that you have to ask, would this team stack up against any of the Bucks/Sixers/Lakers/Clippers/Rockets and be competitive or be expected to beat them in a 7 game series.

* The other factor to consider is roster construction. **Players have been graded very harshly in these rankings if they would not fit appropriately around other players**. A guy like Demar DeRozan slid all the way to tier 4 despite being a borderline all star because he offers limited skills to a genuine contender. In this hypothetical, even if you picked the worst fit around Derozan, ie Simmons from tier 3, Russ from Tier 2, and Embiid from tier 1, you would still have a very good team as their overall skill would be overwhelming for some of the teams they play against. Similarly guys like PJ Tucker and Klay Thompson are all the way up to Tier 3 and Tier 2 respectively simply because they fit so many different teams so easily. I have taken the harshest approach with regards to this just to make it easier. I’m sure I could make a genuine contender around a guy like Russ or Lillard if i perfectly constructed the team around him (ie a Russ/Klay/Covington/Ilyasova/Lopez) team would be almost certainly a contender, but thats using too perfect an example.

* **To make it easier to digest I have also separated the Tiers in to traditional positions (1-5)** however there is leeway for moving between positions where it’s  obviously a borderline call. ie LeBron James is listed as a PF purely because that’s how I broke down the teams, but he could easily be an SF and play alongside almost any of the listed PFs. Ben Simmons is listed as an SF here because that’s likely what he would defend on the average team, but you could easily use him as a PG.

* I’ve also included all the extra players. **The top 30 by each position are listed, but there’s not much difference** when it comes to the 5th starter and the rest, ie the difference between Deandre Jordan and Javale McGee is quite minimal. I have no issue with preferring one over the other, I’ve just made a basic judgement call at that level.

* I'm not really here to start a fully fledged debate about individual players, but more to get a sense of a better way to rank players.

* I've also included a link to an easier to digest spreadsheet here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lek5neGpfpb-1_pvTl-iF_HvwLm7oBz0vcH5FwPINX0/edit?usp=sharing

I always find it entertaining so long as the player does not die from the event. If they’re ok shortly after then its something that they can watch on YouTube with their kids and have a laugh at.

For me personally I have never quite experienced it in the years I have had playing basketball on/off, the closest thing to passing out actually being myself when I tore my knee ligament. The only thing that passed out was my knee though so in comparison to the entire body passing out it simply can not compare...

Here is the Formula:

(PTS)/

{2(FGA+(.44FTA))+1.36986*((LOST BALL TOV+Offensive Fouls)/(AVG sec per touch))}

I used Lost Ball TOVs because those are the turnovers made when a player is still a threat to score the basketball. Bad pass turnovers would be a negative to passing efficiency, not scoring efficiency. I also added in offensive fouls because once again, those are acts of scoring (albeit negative).

Now, the big difference. What is this 1.36986 number? Well, its the ratio of (Change of Possession off turnovers):(Change of possession off of missed shots).

The League average offensive rebound % is roughly 27%. This means that 73% of the time, a missed shot results in a ""turnover"". 100% of the time, Offensive Fouls and Lost Ball turnovers result in a ""turnover'.

Now, you may be asking, why didn't I seperate shots that were rebounded by the player's team? Because the player has no control over that. If a player misses a shot and their team gets it back, that's not a positive for the player, it's just not a negative.

Finally, I divided the total ""scoring turnovers"" by the player's average second per touch because I wanted to standardize the stat across starters and bench players and guards and bigs.


The [results](https://www.reddit.com/user/JasonH0711/comments/csbeeu/testing_new_ts/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) see a negative adjustment for everyone, as expected. 

However, when I [ranked](https://www.reddit.com/user/fatcocksinmybum/comments/csci3w/ts_rankings/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) the players by their Old TS% and their New Scoring Efficiency %, I noticed a trend: players that score the majority of their points on the interior went down, while guards, especially elite shooters, rose in the rankings.

**Head Coach: Gregg Popovich (1996-)**

Accolades w/Team: 1245-575 Regular Season Record, 170-114 Playoff Record, 6 Finals Appearances, 5x NBA Champion

**Assistant Coach: Stan Albeck (1980-83)**

Accolades w/Team: 153-93 Regular Season Record, 13-14 Playoff Record

**Assistant Coach: Bob Hill (1994-96)**

Accolades w/Team: 124-58 Regular Season Record, 14-11 Playoff Record

&amp;#x200B;

**PG1: Tony Parker (2001-18)**

Accolades w/Team: 5 Finals Appearances, 4x NBA Champion, 1x Finals MVP, 6x All-Star, 3x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 15.8 PPG, 2.8 RPG, 5.7 APG, 0.9 SPG, 0.1 BPG

Tony Parker was one of the best point guards in the 2000s as well as one of the greatest San Antonio Spurs of all-time as he played 17 productive seasons for the franchise. After averaging 9.2 PPG as a rookie, T.P. improved over the next three seasons as he averaged 15.6 PPG, 3.2 RPG, and 5.6 APG during that span which included two NBA championships. After the 2005 NBA Championship, Parker emerged as one of the best point guards over the next nine seasons as he averaged 18.6 PPG, 3 RPG, and 6.3 APG while making the All-Star team in six of those seasons. During that span, Parker had his best year in 2008-09 as he averaged 22 PPG, 3.1 RPG, and 6.9 APG, and he helped lead the Spurs to two championships in 2007 and 2014, winning the Finals MVP in 2007 as he averaged 24.5 PPG, 5 RPG, and 3.3 APG in four games against LeBron and the Cavaliers in the 2007 NBA Finals. However, Parker did have his fair share of injuries, but they didn’t begin to slow him down until after the 2014 championship run. He was a solid point guard for the next three seasons, averaging 12.2 PPG over that span before a ruptured quad in the 2017 postseason. While Parker’s Spurs tenure ended disappointingly, he was still important as the floor general of the Spurs in the 2000s.

&amp;#x200B;

**PG2: James Silas (1972-81)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star, 1x All-ABA 1st Team, 1x All-ABA 2nd Team

Stats: 16.7 PPG, 3.2 RPG, 3.9 APG, 1.1 SPG, 0.2 BPG

James Silas was a pretty good point guard for most of the nine seasons that he spent with the San Antonio Spurs. Silas joined the franchise while they were in the ABA as a free agent, and he was solid in his first two seasons as he averaged 14.8 PPG, 4.2 RPG, and 3.5 APG. However, Silas was one of the ABA’s best guards over the next two seasons as he averaged 21.6 PPG, 3.9 RPG, and 5.1 APG during those two years while also being selected to an All-ABA Team in both years. However, knee injuries hampered Silas once the Spurs moved to the NBA as he played in just 59 out of a possible 164 games over the next two seasons while averaging just 6 PPG. While Silas was healthy again for the 1978-79 season, and averaged 17.1 PPG over the next three seasons, including that one, he was not the same player after those knee injuries, and he was traded to the Cavaliers during the 1981 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**PG3: Johnny Moore (1980-87, 1989-90)**

Stats: 9.4 PPG, 3 RPG, 7.4 APG, 2 SPG, 0.2 BPG

Johnny Moore was a solid point guard during his nine-year stay in San Antonio. After averaging 7.4 PPG as the backup to James Silas in his rookie year, Moore improved in his second season, after the Spurs traded Silas, as he averaged 9.4 PPG, 9.6 APG, and 2.1 SPG. Moore maintained that consistency as a point guard that put up a lot of assists and steals as he averaged 11.8 PPG, 3.8 RPG, 9.8 APG, and 2.5 SPG over the next three seasons. Moore started the 1985-86 season really well, averaging 13 PPG, 9 APG, and 2.5 SPG in 28 games before contracting a rare illness that hampered his play for the rest of his career and ended that season for him.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG1: George Gervin (1974-85)**

Accolades w/Team: 12x All-Star, 1980 All-Star Game MVP, 5x All-NBA 1st Team, 4x All-NBA/ABA 2nd Team

Stats: 26.3 PPG, 5.4 RPG, 2.8 APG, 1.3 SPG, 1 BPG

George Gervin was an exceptional scorer and player during his 11-and-a-half seasons with the San Antonio Spurs. Acquired by the Spurs during the 1973-74 ABA season, Gervin was very good for the team in the 25 games he played that season as he averaged 19.4 PPG and 8.2 RPG. Gervin continued to be really good over his next three seasons as he averaged 22.8 PPG, 6.9 RPG, and 2.6 APG during that span while making the All-Star team in each of those seasons. However, starting with the 1977-78 season, Gervin was one of the best scorers in the NBA from that season to the 1981-82 season as he averaged 29.8 PPG, 4.1 RPG, and 2.9 APG during those five years. Not only did the Iceman score a ton during those five seasons, but he made the All-NBA 1st Team in each of those seasons, led the NBA in scoring in four of those seasons including one season averaging 33.1 PPG and another averaging 32.3 PPG. Although Gervin didn’t score as much as he did in those five years over his final three seasons with the Spurs, he was an All-Star in each of those seasons while averaging 24.5 PPG during that span. He was traded to the Bulls before the 1985-86 season, but he was exceptional when he played for the Spurs.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG2: Manu Ginobili (2002-18)**

Accolades w/Team: 5 Finals Appearances, 4x NBA Champion, 2x All-Star, 2007-08 Sixth Man of the Year, 2x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 13.3 PPG, 3.5 RPG, 3.8 APG, 1.3 SPG, 0.3 BPG

Drafted 57th overall in the 1999 NBA Draft, Manu Ginobili did not debut for the Spurs until 2002, but he was really good during the 16 years he played in San Antonio. Ginobili was solid in his first two years as he averaged 10.4 PPG, but his third season would result in an All-Star selection as he averaged 16 PPG, 4.4 RPG, and 3.9 APG on a Spurs team that would eventually win that year’s championship. Ginobili maintained that consistency over the next six seasons as he averaged 16.9 PPG, 4.1 RPG, and 4.2 APG during that span while making the All-NBA 3rd Team twice, winning the Sixth Man of the Year award in the 2007-08 season as he averaged 19.5 PPG, 4.8 RPG, and 4.5 APG that year, and helping the Spurs win another NBA championship in 2007. While Ginobili’s role was reduced in his last seven seasons with the team, he was still a key role player as he averaged 10.3 PPG during that span which included another championship in 2014.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG3: Alvin Robertson (1984-89)**

Accolades w/Team: 3x All-Star, 1985-86 Defensive Player of the Year, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-Defensive 1st Team, 3x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 16.2 PPG, 5.4 RPG, 5.4 APG, 2.9 SPG, 0.5 BPG

Alvin Robertson is long forgotten among most NBA fans, but he was one of the best defensive guards during his five-year stint with the San Antonio Spurs. Drafted by the Spurs with the seventh overall pick in the 1984 NBA Draft, Robertson averaged just 9.2 PPG in 21.3 MPG during his rookie season. However, with George Gervin traded to the Bulls, Robertson had a huge breakout sophomore season as he averaged 17 PPG, 6.3 RPG, 5.5 APG, and a league-leading 3.7 SPG en route to a selection to the All-NBA 2nd Team as well as both the Defensive Player of the Year and Most Improved Player award in that same season. Robertson continued with his excellent all-around and defensive play as he averaged 18.3 PPG, 5.7 RPG, 6 APG, and 3.1 SPG over the next three seasons while making the All-Star team an additional two times before being traded to the Bucks after the 1988-89 season.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF1: Kawhi Leonard (2011-18)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 1x NBA Champion, 1x Finals MVP, 2x All-Star, 2x Defensive Player of the Year, 2x All-NBA 1st Team, 3x All-Defensive 1st Team, 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 16.3 PPG, 6.2 RPG, 2.3 APG, 1.8 SPG, 0.7 BPG

Drafted 15th overall in the 2011 NBA Draft, Kawhi Leonard was one of the best two-way players in the NBA during his seven-year stint with the San Antonio Spurs. Kawhi averaged 10.9 PPG and 5.8 RPG during his first three regular seasons with the team, but he broke out in the 2014 postseason as he helped lead the Spurs to the NBA championship as he won Finals MVP by averaging 17.8 PPG, 6.4 RPG, and 2 APG and guarding LeBron James well in five Finals games against the Miami Heat. Kawhi improved even more in the 2014-15 season as he averaged 16.5 PPG, 7.2 RPG, 2.5 APG, and 2.3 SPG en route to winning that year’s Defensive Player of the Year. Kawhi was even better in the two seasons after that as he was seen arguably the best two-way player in the NBA during both seasons as he averaged 23.4 PPG, 6.3 RPG, 3.1 APG, and 1.8 SPG during that span which included an All-NBA 1st Team and All-Defensive 1st Team selection in both years as well another Defensive Player of the Year award in the 2015-16 season. Unfortunately, Leonard suffered an ankle injury during the 2017 postseason followed by a quadriceps injury that kept him out for most of the 2017-18 season. After that season, Leonard demanded a trade, and his wish was granted when he was traded to the Raptors during the 2018 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF2: Sean Elliott (1989-93, 1994-01)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x NBA Champion, 2x All-Star

Stats: 14.4 PPG, 4.4 RPG, 2.5 APG, 0.8 SPG, 0.4 BPG

Sean Elliott was a very good player during his 11 years with the San Antonio Spurs. Drafted third overall by the franchise in the 1989 NBA Draft, Elliott had a solid rookie year as he averaged 10 PPG. However, Elliott improved in the three seasons as he averaged 16.4 PPG and 5.2 RPG during that season which included his first All-Star selection in 1993. Following that year, the Spurs traded him to the Pistons after that season for Dennis Rodman. However, Elliott was reacquired by the Spurs during the 1994 offseason after one mediocre season with the Pistons. During the 1994-95 season, he got back where he left off and averaged 18.1 PPG  followed by an average of 20 PPG next year while making another All-Star team. However, he suffered a knee injury in the 1996-97 season and dealt with kidney disease which hampered the rest of his career as he averaged 10.2 PPG in his final five seasons with the team.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF3: Bruce Bowen (2001-09)**

Accolades w/Team: 3 Finals Appearances, 3x NBA Champion, 5x All-Defensive 1st Team, 2x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 6.4 PPG, 3 RPG, 1.3 APG, 0.8 SPG, 0.4 BPG

Bruce Bowen was never a really good scorer, but he was a very good 3-and-D role player in eight seasons with the Spurs. After making the All-Defensive 2nd Team in the 2000-01 season, Bowen signed with the Spurs in the 2001 offseason. Bowen’s defense in San Antonio was so good that he was selected to the All-Defensive Team seven times and his defense contributed to three NBA championships for the Spurs. Despite being one of the worst free-throw shooters of all-time, Bowen was a really good three-point shooter as he shot 40.5% from the three-point line on 2.6 attempts per game during his eight-year stint in San Antonio. After the 2008-09 season where he averaged just 2.7 PPG, he retired, but he was very valuable to the team during the 2000s.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF1: Tim Duncan (1997-16)**

Accolades w/Team: 6 Finals Appearances, 5x NBA Champion, 3x Finals MVP, 2x NBA MVP, 15x All-Star, 2000 All-Star Game MVP, 1997-98 Rookie of the Year, 10x All-NBA 1st Team, 3x All-NBA 2nd Team, 2x All-NBA 3rd Team, 8x All-Defensive 1st Team, 7x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 19 PPG, 10.8 RPG, 3 APG, 0.7 SPG, 2.2 BPG

Tim Duncan is easily the greatest San Antonio Spur of all-time as well as the greatest power forward in NBA history as he was magnificent during his 19 seasons with the franchise. Drafted with the first overall pick in the 1997 NBA Draft, the Big Fundamental had a huge rookie season as he averaged 21.1 PPG, 11.9 RPG, and 2.5 BPG while leading the Spurs to 56 wins, winning the Rookie of the Year, and being selected to the All-NBA 1st Team. After that amazing rookie season, Duncan made the All-NBA 1st Team in each of his next seven seasons as he averaged 22.8 PPG, 12.2 RPG, and 2.5 BPG during that span which included six selections to the All-Defensive 1st Team, three NBA championships, three Finals MVPs, and two regular-season MVPs. Although Timmy only averaged 20 PPG once after the 2004-05 season, he still was an All-Star in each of the next five seasons as he averaged 19 PPG, 10.7 RPG, 3.2 APG, and 1.9 BPG during that span which included another championship in 2007. Although Duncan’s minutes were reduced to 28.4 MPG in his final six seasons, he was still pretty good as he averaged 14.1 PPG and 9.1 RPG during that span which included three All-Star selections and another championship in 2014. Duncan retired after the 2015-16 season, but he did nothing but great things for the franchise both offensively and defensively.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*PF2: Larry Kenon (1975-80)\*\*Accolades w/Team: 3x All-Star

Stats: 20.7 PPG, 10.3 RPG, 3 APG, 1.6 SPG, 0.4 BPG

Larry Kenon was a really good power forward during his five seasons with the San Antonio Spurs. During Kenon’s first season with the Spurs, which would be the final ABA season, he averaged 18.7 PPG and 11.1 RPG while making the All-Star team again after making it twice with the New York Nets.  After the Spurs moved to the NBA, Kenon continued to play really well as he averaged 21.2 PPG, 10.1 RPG, 3.3 APG, and 1.7 SPG during his four NBA seasons with the Spurs while making the All-Star team twice in that span. However, Kenon left the Spurs after the 1979-80 season as he signed with the Chicago Bulls during the 1980 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF3: LaMarcus Aldridge (2015-)**

Accolades w/Team: 3x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 20 PPG, 8.4 RPG, 2 APG, 0.6 SPG, 1.2 BPG

LaMarcus Aldridge is the first and only player on this All-Time Spurs team that is still playing for the franchise as of 2019. After nine productive seasons with the Portland Trail Blazers, Aldridge signed with the Spurs as a free agent. In his first season with the team, Aldridge averaged 18 PPG and 8.5 RPG while making the All-NBA 3rd Team and helping lead the Spurs to 67 wins that season. After his stats went slightly down in his second season as he averaged 17.3 PPG and 7.3 RPG, Aldridge was really good in the last two seasons as he averaged 22.2 PPG and 8.8 RPG during both years with an All-Star selection in each of those two years. An excellent mid-range shooter, Aldridge heads into the 2019-20 season with his fifth season with the team.

**C1: David Robinson (1989-03)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 2x NBA Champion, 1x NBA MVP, 10x All-Star, 1989-90 Rookie of the Year, 1991-92 Defensive Player of the Year, 4x All-NBA 1st Team, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team, 4x All-NBA 3rd Team, 4x All-Defensive 1st Team, 4x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 21.1 PPG, 10.6 RPG, 2.5 APG, 1.4 SPG, 3 BPG

David Robinson is an all-time great San Antonio Spurs player as he played 14 magnificent seasons with the team. Drafted first overall in the 1987 NBA Draft, David Robinson did not play his first NBA game until 1989 due to serving in the Navy for two years. Although the Spurs waited for two years to see him in-game, it was worth the wait for the Spurs as he helped the team improve by 35 games from the previous season while averaging 24.3 PPG, 12 RPG, and 3.9 BPG which helped him make the All-Star team and win the Rookie of the Year award. The Admiral continued to be one of the best centers in the NBA over the next six seasons as he averaged 25.8 PPG, 11.7 RPG, 3.3 APG, and 3.6 BPG during that span which included an All-Star selection in each of those seasons as well as one Defensive Player of the Year award and an MVP in 1995. However, Robinson missed the beginning of the 1996-97 season with a back injury, and he played in just six games before breaking his foot. He was never the same player after that, but once they got Tim Duncan in the 1997 Draft, the two formed a really good big man duo as he averaged 21.6 PPG, 10.6 RPG, and 2.6 BPG during his first season alongside Duncan. Robinson averaged 13.8 PPG and 8.9 RPG during his final five seasons in the NBA while helping them win two championships before retiring after the second one in 2003.

&amp;#x200B;

**C2: John Beasley (1967-71)**

Accolades w/Team: 3x All-Star, 1969 All-Star Game MVP, 2x All-ABA 2nd Team

Stats: 17.9 PPG, 11 RPG, 1.5 APG

John Beasley was a very center during his stint with the former Dallas Chaparrals which lasted a little over four seasons. Beasley was one of the top centers in the ABA in his first three seasons as he averaged 19.1 PPG and 11.8 RPG during that span which included an All-Star selection in each of those three years and two All-ABA selections. However, Beasley’s stats decreased in the 1970-71 season as they went down to 15.9 PPG and 9.2, and they would only get worse as he averaged 9 PPG and 7.5 RPG in the first 12 games of the 1971-72 season before getting traded to the Utah Stars.

&amp;#x200B;

**C3: Artis Gilmore (1982-87)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star

Stats: 16.1 PPG, 9.7 RPG, 1.5 APG, 0.5 SPG, 1.8 BPG

Acquired by the Spurs from the Bulls during the 1982 offseason, Artis Gilmore was a very good center for the Spurs for five years. In his first season in San Antonio, Gilmore was really good as he averaged 18 PPG, 12 RPG, 2.3 BPG, and led the NBA in field-goal percentage at 62.6% from the field which resulted in an All-Star selection. Although that first season would be his best in a Spurs uniform, he was still pretty good in his next three seasons, averaging 17.2 PPG and 9.8 RPG during that span. He played one more season with the Spurs, averaging 11.4 PPG and 7.1 RPG, before being traded back to Chicago after the 1986-87 season.

**Analysis**

* This is one of the best starting lineups an all-time can have. Tony Parker at the point guard is really good as he is very fast which helps him get to the basket quicker than most and he is a very good playmaker. Parker, as a playmaker, has some excellent options to pass to with exceptional scorers in George Gervin and Kawhi Leonard. This all-time team also has one of the best big man duos out there with Duncan and Robinson dominating people in the post while scoring inside and rebounding quite easily. The offense is really good as all five guys put up more than 20 PPG during their best season and their defense is also really good in the starting lineup as they have 2 guys who won Defensive Player of the Year in Kawhi and Robinson as well as a guy that made many All-Defensive teams in Tim Duncan.
* The second unit is pretty good as well. All of these guys in the second unit were very good scorers as Silas, Elliott, Kenon, Beasley, and most importantly, Manu Ginobili put up around 20 PPG during their respective best season with the team. Manu Ginobili is easily the team's sixth man as he was a very good shooter and solid playmaker while the other guys will help Ginobili with their scoring.
* This is one of the best All-Time teams out there, although there aren't really any players that I would consider flashy on this all-time team. Coincidentally, the next all-time team isn't among the best all-time teams while it is also a super flashy one.

He led the Rockets to an NBA championship with no other All-NBA member, All-Star, and no player on any All-Defensive team. 

I looked at his teammates' accolades, most of them besides Thorpe and Horry have none. And for those wondering, Thorpe in '92 was an All-Star and Horry in '93 was 2nd All-Rookie. 

Olajuwon not only led the Rockets to their 1st ever championship, he did so in legendary fashion. He led his team in all 5 major statistical categories in the playoffs. 

Not to mention that he was the one who guarded Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, and Patrick Ewing. He not only carried the offensive load but he was tasked with shutting down 3 other top-10 players. 

And to top it all off, he won the MVP &amp; DPOTY.

Their main argument being that he only won because of his triple-double average/record and that his team record wasn't even good enough to win the award.

We all know of the double-standards and oxymorons that come with what it truly means to be an MVP, but whatever your definition may be, Westbrook truly deserved his MVP. 

Westbrook was top-10 in both averages &amp; totals for points, rebounds, assists, and steals. He was also 2nd among all guards for both offensive rebounds per game and total offensive rebounds.

He led his team in 4 of the 5 major statistical categories and led the league in scoring average and total points. 

He was also #1 in PER, OBPM, VORP, and was #2 in DBPM. He was #5 in WS, #8 in DWS, #9 in OWS, and #10 in WS/48.

Not to mention that OKC was in the bottom-5 for 3-pointers per game and was dead last in 3PT% along with the fact that Houston was better suited for Harden goes to show how much Westbrook deserved it. 

OKC lacked any sort of outside threat and their next best offensive option was Victor Oladipo before he had blossomed into the player he is now.

I'll start with the **Portland Trail Blazers**.

Not picking through minutia, but here are some highlights of Blazers' coach Neil Olshey since he was hired right before Draft 2012. 

**ACCOMPLISHMENTS:**

**Drafted**: Dame, CJ, Connaughton, Crabbe, Collins, Simons, Trent (some of these I consider successes because he found NBA talent so late in the draft)

**Traded**: Plumlee for Nurkic+Pick (that became Collins), Hark/Meyers for Whiteside, Turner for Bazemore
FA Signed: Aminu, Harkless, Hood, Kanter

**Let Walk**: Batum, Matthews

**Big Contracts**: Dame, CJ, Nurk


**FAILURES:** 


**Drafted**: Leonard (I'm not 100% I even consider this a failure, given it was 11th pick and he is still in the league for legit reasons)



**Traded**: Barton for Afflalo

**FA Signed**: Turner

**Let Walk**: Aldridge, Aminu (he's a talented guy. I was ready to see him go, but he was still a valuable piece.)

**Big Contracts**: Leonard, Harkless, Turner

Overall he inherited a team that was kind of directionless and floundering with one star player and a decent cast of role players. Adding Dame actually gave us a small chance at championship contention, and when shit hit the fan he executed a full rebuild that had us back in the Western Conference Finals in less than 5 years without dipping into the lottery once.

The lowest point was letting Aldridge walk without compensation. You can chalk that up to LMA weirdness, but when that much talent leaves uncompensated, the GM has to take some blame. Second lowest were the stupid trifecta of contracts in 2016.

His best accomplishments were drafting Dame/CJ (and the jury is out but we may count Simons on that list soon) and locking them up throughout their peak years, and swindling Denver for Nurkic + Pick (that became Collins).

When you look at everything that happened from 2001 to 2012, from the Jail Blazers and Oden Saga and Roy Knee and everything else, it's easy to see now how badly the post-Aldridge era could've gone. It definitely helps that Lillard has led the team through the transition, but hey, our GM is the reason we have Lillard. So if you want to point the finger at Dame, you still have to point the finger at Olshey.

I guess everybody is entitled to their opinions, but given how few free agents Portland traditionally attracts and how we haven't had lots of lottery tanking, I personally don't see how you give him anything less than an A. I kind of waffled on A-, but in the end I think LMA fucks over any other GM in the same situation (see Kwame for example), and everybody was handing out ludicrous deals in 2016. So those failures sucked, but they weren't uniquely sucky. 

I probably would've graded him much worse after the Pelicans sweep, and I may grade him differently next year. So there's some recency bias I'll admit to. But jeez, how good do you expect us to be? I feel like some people will only grade him an A if Portland wins a championship. That's too high of a bar, IMO. (Especially given the Warriors Dynasty.) I want a competitive, playoff team with a bright future, and that's what I've got. 

So I'm comfortable with an A.",True,False,,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,63853,public,self,Grade your team's current GM,0,1566306585,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/csgvcp/grade_your_teams_current_gm/,,,,,,,,,,,,

This past week, 24 fans participated in POSITION GOATS in which fans were asked a wide array of questions about which players were the greatest of all time at all of the different positions, among other miscellaneous questions.

We also make a magazine (free) that is released every week to go along with the survey: [https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:42c0b6ad-3a3e-4c65-aa42-61cc690532fb](https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:42c0b6ad-3a3e-4c65-aa42-61cc690532fb)

I will also be making a tentative prediction on which two teams will make it out of the group to the next round.

I do not claim to have any significant experience watching most of these teams. However, since this is an overview, I was hoping to get some input from you all if you follow certain teams more closely. Today’s post in particular includes Group A.

---------------------

###Group A

######Pot 1: China (host), FIBA Rank: 30th

China brought pretty much their national team to the NBA Summer League, so we were able to see their players in action together. They got an unprecedented win, thanks to the Hornets summer league team playing without Miles Bridges, Dwayne Bacon, Devonte’ Graham, and 1st round pick P.J. Washington. The Hornets summer league team outside of those four was *not* good by any means. Needless to say, the Chinese national team is not very good.

They have decent size, especially for an international basketball tourney. Between 7-footers **Zhou Qi** (ex-Rocket) and **Wang Zhelin** (57th pick in 2016 by the Grizzlies), China boasts two centers who can defend the rim (4 blocks for Zhou Qi against the Hornets), grab boards, and rim-roll decently. Zhou Qi has range, too, which will come in handy with the shorter 3-point line. Zhou Qi especially will need to stay out of foul trouble to remain effective, especially with the FIBA 5-foul rules.

The team also has a couple of players who were previously NBA summer league darlings, albeit for different reasons. **Ding Yanyuhang**, who played with the Mavs summer league team, showed a methodical style of play, along with the ability to space, cut, and score at the rim.  He demonstrated that he could at least handle the NBA Summer League pace, though it was clear he could have trouble with the speed and explosiveness of NBA players. On the other hand, **Abudushalamu Abudurexiti** (Warriors) gained notoriety as a tongue twister for the play-by-play announcers. However, he also proved to be a solid player and he has carried the load for the Chinese team on numerous occasions in international play.

However, the Chinese player whose game best translated to the Summer League competition had no affiliation with the NBA at all. 6’4” guard **Guo Ailun** scored 15.7 PPG in the three games he played in, and was clearly the offensive engine for the team. China relied heavily upon him to make plays, take j’s, drive and kick out, and PnR with the bigs. If they want to advance, they’ll be leaning on him to repeat his performance.

----------------------

The rest of Group A is pretty non-descript as far as NBA-related players go. 

######Venezuela (Pot 4, FIBA Rank: 20th) 

Venezuela qualified off decent play against the other North American teams. They went 1-1 with Canada, 1-1 with Brazil, and 1-1 with Dominican Republic. This team plays egalitarian, with a lot of cuts and probing to try and get a good shot for the team. Unfortunately, against a more talented and athletic team, Venezuela should get outclassed. No player really jumps off the page for me, but a couple of brothers, **Gregory** (PG) and **Jose Vargas** (SF) seem to be two of their better players. Still, they seem well-coached and could very well make it out of this Group of Life.

######Poland (Pot 5, FIBA Rank: 25th) 

The Polish national team had not qualified for the FIBA World Cup since 1967, so while that certainly implies that they’ve improved as a team, they’re still below average when it comes to teams at the tournament. However, they took out a Croatia team missing their NBA players back in February (Bojan, Saric, Zubac, Zizic) to make it this far, which may count for something.

Probably the most recognizable player they have is **Maciej Lampe**, who was drafted by the Knicks in 2003, and spent three seasons in the NBA, playing only a grand total of 632 minutes. On ten minutes a game, he accrued career totals of 3.4 PPG and 2.2 RPG on 40.7% FG% (or 43.5 TS%). 

However, he’s pretty legendary when it comes to being included in trades with big names, starting off with the pick used on him changing hands in the Marcus Camby deal. He was also a part of the McDyess-Marbury/Hardaway trade and was eventually traded (in a larger deal) for a second-rounder that ended up becoming Marcin Gortat. He was even traded straight up for Moochie Norris in 2006. Much like his NBA career, he then bounced around from league to league. He went from Russia to Israel, back to Russia, then Spain, Turkey, and finally China, where he remains today. He also happens to be the best player on the Polish roster. Speaking of Marcin Gortat, not sure why he’s not playing.

Other players to watch out for include **Mateusz Ponitka**, who came up with two huge LeBron blocks against Croatia, and **A.J. Slaughter**.

######Ivory Coast (Pot 8, FIBA Rank: 64th)

Last, but not least (perhaps), we have Ivory Coast, the worst ranked team in the tournament. No one on this team is notable. Mo Bamba is eligible to play for them, it seems, but isn’t on their roster. They are definitely the odd team out here, and I think the other three teams will annihilate them.

-----------------

#####Group A prediction: Poland, Venezuela, China (2-1) and Ivory Coast (0-3), with who moves on determined by tiebreaker.

In reality, Rose simply deserved it. Yes, James posted both better regular &amp; advanced statistics but there's more to the MVP than just basic statistics. 

That year, James had both Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade. Both of which were top 10 players. Bosh had averaged 18 and 8 whereas as Wade averaged 26-6-5. 

Rose's team, however, was constantly battling injuries. Their 2nd option in Boozer missed 22 games, their defensive anchor in Noah missed 34 games, and for much of the season Rose's next best players were Luol Deng &amp; Ronnie Brewer. 

Rose as a 22 year-old led an awful-offensive, injured Bulls team to 62 wins and was their only legitimate option. And people make it seem like Rose's numbers weren't good in their own right, he averaged 25-4-8.

**Head Coach: Jack Ramsay (1976-86)**

Accolades w/Team: 453-367 Regular Season Record, 29-30 Playoff Record, 1 Finals Appearance, 1x NBA Champion

**Assistant Coach: Rick Adelman (1989-94)**

Accolades w/Team: 291-154 Regular Season Record, 36-33 Playoff Record, 2 Finals Appearances

**Assistant Coach: Terry Stotts (2012-)**

Accolades w/Team: 325-249 Regular Season Record, 19-32 Playoff Record

&amp;#x200B;

**PG1: Damian Lillard (2012-)**

Accolades w/Team: 4x All-Star, 2012-13 Rookie of the Year, 1x All-NBA 1st Team, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 23.5 PPG, 4.2 RPG, 6.3 APG, 1 SPG, 0.3 BPG

Damian Lillard is one of the best point guards in the NBA today. Despite being drafted sixth overall by the Blazers in the 2012 NBA Draft, Lillard had his doubters, and he proved them wrong in his rookie season as he averaged 19 PPG and 6.5 APG while winning the Rookie of the Year. Lillard was really good in the next two seasons as the second option on the Blazers to LaMarcus Aldridge as he averaged 20.8 PPG, 4.1 RPG, and 5.9 APG while making the All-Star team both times. After Aldridge left in free agency of 2015 to the San Antonio Spurs, Lillard had a huge 2015-16 season as he averaged 25.1 PPG, 4 RPG, and 6.8 APG which resulted in a selection to the All-NBA 2nd Team and a second-round appearance in the postseason. Lillard continues to thrive as a leader as in the past three seasons, he averaged 26.5 PPG, 4.7 RPG, and 6.5 APG. After losing in the first round in both 2017 and 2018, Lillard led the Blazers to the Western Conference Finals this past season and even had his moments like the[ game-winner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-M3x-eZpV8) that ended the Russell Westbrook-era for the Thunder.

&amp;#x200B;

**PG2: Terry Porter (1985-95)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 2x All-Star

Stats: 14.9 PPG, 3.5 RPG, 7 APG, 1.6 SPG, 0.1 BPG

Terry Porter was a really good point guard during his 10-year tenure with the Portland Trail Blazers. After averaging 7.1 PPG in just 15.4 MPG in his first season with the team, Porter thrived as the starting point guard for the franchise over the next seven seasons. During the seven seasons that he started at point guard, Porter averaged 16.7 PPG, 3.9 RPG, 8.1 APG, and 1.7 SPG while also making the All-Star team twice and helping the Blazers make the NBA Finals twice in that span. However, Porter came off the bench for a majority of the games he played in over his final two seasons with the team as his averages went down 11.8 PPG during that span. He was released by the Blazers before the 1995-96 season, but he was an excellent playmaker and three-point shooter during his long stay in Portland.

&amp;#x200B;

**PG3: Rod Strickland (1992-96, 2001)**

Stats: 16.2 PPG, 4.3 RPG, 8.2 APG, 1.6 SPG, 0.2 BPG

After averaging 13.8 PPG, 8.6 APG, and 2.1 SPG during his final season with the San Antonio Spurs, Rod Strickland signed with the Portland Trail Blazers during the 1992 offseason. He was a solid role player in his first season with the team as he averaged 13.7 PPG and 7.2 APG. After that season, Strickland took over the role as the starting point guard for the team as he averaged 17.2 PPG, 9 APG, and 1.8 SPG during his second season with the team. Strickland improved even more as the starting point guard in his next two seasons as he averaged 18.8 PPG, 4.7 RPG, 9.2 APG, and 1.7 SPG while shooting 35.9% from three-point range on 1.8 attempts per game. After the 1995-96 season, Strickland was traded to the Washington Bullets for a young Rasheed Wallace, but he returned to the team during the 2000-01 season, although he did not do much in his uneventful second-stint with the team as he averaged just 4.6 PPG in just 21 games.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG1: Brandon Roy (2006-11)**

Accolades w/Team: 3x All-Star, 2006-07 Rookie of the Year, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 19 PPG, 4.3 RPG, 4.7 APG, 1 SPG, 0.2 BPG

Brandon Roy had a productive five-year tenure with the Portland Trail Blazers and, sadly, we didn’t see more of him due to horrible knee issues. Drafted sixth overall in the 2006 NBA Draft, Roy had a very good rookie season as he averaged 16.8 PPG en route to winning the Rookie of the Year award. After averaging 19.1 PPG and being selected to the All-Star team for the first time in the 2007-08 season, Roy was even better in the two seasons after that as he averaged 22.1 PPG, 4.6 RPG, and 4.9 APG during that span in which he also was selected to an All-NBA team both times. However, Roy’s knee problems got progressively worse as he played in just 47 games in the 2010-11 season and he averaged just 12.2 PPG. While he did have his moments that year, like leading a comeback in Game 4 of the first round against the eventual-champion Mavericks by scoring 18 points in that game’s fourth quarter, Roy was waived by the Blazers before the 2011-12 season, and he retired shortly after.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG2: Geoff Petrie (1970-76)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star, 1970-71 Rookie of the Year

Stats: 21.8 PPG, 2.8 RPG, 4.6 APG, 1.1 SPG, 0.1 BPG

Geoff Petrie was the first-ever draft pick in Portland Trail Blazers history, and he proved to be a really good player in his six seasons with the team. He had a really good rookie season, which also happened to be the inaugural season for the Blazers, as he averaged 24.8 PPG, 3.4 RPG, and 4.8 APG while making the All-Star team and winning the Rookie of the Year award. After his averages went slightly down to 18.9 PPG in his second season, Petrie was really good in his next two seasons, averaging 24.6 PPG, 3.2 RPG, and 4.4 APG during that span while also making the All-Star team again in 1974. After averaging 18.6 PPG in his final two seasons, Petrie was forced to retire due to knee problems after the 1975-76 season. Although this has not much to do with the Blazers career, it should be noted that Petrie, along with Sonics All-Star Spencer Haywood, was among the first NBA players to be signed with Nike.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG3: Jim Paxson (1979-87)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 16 PPG, 2.3 RPG, 3.2 APG, 1.4 SPG, 0.1 BPG

Jim Paxson was a really good player during his tenure for the Blazers that lasted for a little more than eight seasons. After averaging just 6.2 PPG on 17.6 MPG in his rookie season, Paxson improved in the next two seasons as he averaged 18 PPG, 2.7 RPG, 3.6 APG, and 1.7 SPG during that span. In the two seasons after that, Paxson was an All-Star both times after that as he averaged 21.5 PPG, 2.1 RPG, 3 APG, and 1.6 SPG during both years. Paxson’s production as the starting shooting guard was so good that the Blazers passed on Michael Jordan with the second pick in the 1984 NBA Draft. However, Paxson’s scoring went down due to the emergence of Clyde Drexler in his final three full seasons with the team as he averaged 14.3 PPG during that span. His averages went down to just 6.1 PPG in the 17 games he played for the Blazers in the 1987-88 season before being traded to the Boston Celtics.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF1: Clyde Drexler (1983-95)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 8x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 1st Team, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team, 2x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 20.8 PPG, 6.2 RPG, 5.7 APG, 2.1 SPG, 0.7 BPG

Drafted 14th overall in the 1983 NBA Draft, Clyde Drexler is the greatest Portland Trail Blazer of all-time as he was a really productive player for that team for 11-and-a-half years. After Drexler averaged just 7.7 PPG in 17.2 MPG in his rookie year, he saw an improvement in his sophomore season as he averaged 17.2 PPG, 6 RPG, 5.5 APG, and 2.2 SPG. The season after that, Drexler was named an All-Star for the first time as he averaged 18.5 PPG, 5.6 RPG, 8 APG, and 2.6 SPG. Drexler averaged at least 20 PPG in each of the next six seasons as he averaged 24.3 PPG, 6.8 RPG, 6.2 APG, 2.2 SPG, and 0.8 BPG during that span which included five All-Star selections, four All-NBA selections, and two Finals appearances. Although Drexler’s averages decreased slightly in the two seasons after finishing second in the MVP voting for the 1991-92 season, he was still an All-Star, averaging 19.5 PPG, 6.4 RPG, and 5.2 APG during both seasons. Even though Drexler averaged 22 PPG in the first 41 games of the 1994-95 season with the Blazers, they were not winning like they were in the early part of the 1990s, and Drexler would be traded to the Houston Rockets during that season.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF2: Clifford Robinson (1989-97)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 1x All-Star, 1992-93 Sixth Man of the Year

Stats: 16.2 PPG, 5.2 RPG, 2.1 APG, 1.1 SPG, 1.1 BPG

Clifford Robinson was a very good player during his eight-year stint with the Portland Trail Blazers. He was a solid role player on a championship contender during his first three years with the team as he averaged 11.1 PPG and 4.4 RPG during that span. However, Robinson improved over the next two seasons as he averaged 19.6 PPG, 6.7 RPG, 1.3 SPG, and 1.7 BPG during that stretch which included the Sixth Man of the Year in the 1992-93 season and an All-Star selection in 1994. Robinson never made the All-Star team after 1994, but his two seasons after that would actually be better than that All-Star campaign. With the three-point shot added to his repertoire, Uncle Cliffy was really good during both the 1994-95 and 1995-96 season as he averaged 21.2 PPG, 5.7 RPG, and 2.5 APG while shooting 37.5% from three on 5.6 attempts per game during that span. After the 1996-97 season, where his averages went down to 15.1 PPG and 4 RPG, Robinson signed with the Suns as a free agent in the 1997 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF3: Jerome Kersey (1984-95)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances

Stats: 12.1 PPG, 6.1 RPG, 2.1 APG, 1.3 SPG, 0.7 BPG

Jerome Kersey was a very good player in his 12 seasons with the Portland Trail Blazers. After averaging just 7.3 PPG in 13.9 MPG over his first two seasons, Kersey improved in his third season as he averaged 12.3 PPG and 6 RPG in the 1986-87 season. Kersey would be one of the best rebounding small forwards in the NBA as he averaged 16 PPG and 8 RPG over the next five seasons as he started on Blazers teams that were contenders in the late 1980s and early 1990s. However, Kersey’s averages decreased to 8.3 PPG and 4.8 RPG over his final three seasons with the team, and he was selected by the Raptors in the 1995 Expansion Draft.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF1: LaMarcus Aldridge (2006-15)**

Accolades w/Team: 4x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 2x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 19.4 PPG, 8.4 RPG, 1.9 APG, 0.8 SPG, 1 BPG

Drafted second overall in the 2006 NBA Draft, LaMarcus Aldridge had a really good nine-year stint with the Portland Trail Blazers. After averaging 9 PPG and 5 RPG as a rookie off the bench, Aldridge improved and was a solid player over the next three seasons as he averaged 17.9 PPG and 7.7 RPG during that span. However, Aldridge improved quite a bit in his fifth season in the NBA as he averaged 21.8 PPG and 8.8 RPG which led to him making the All-NBA 3rd Team. Aldridge remained consistently good in his next four seasons after that as he averaged 22.4 PPG and 9.7 RPG during those four years while also making the All-Star team in each of those years. Although he was an excellent player with a really good mid-range jumper, the Blazers only advanced past the first round once with Aldridge on the team, and he signed with the Spurs during the 2015 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF2: Maurice Lucas (1976-80, 1987-88)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x NBA Champion, 3x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-Defensive 1st Team, 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 15.6 PPG, 8.7 RPG, 2.5 APG, 0.8 SPG, 0.7 BPG

Maurice Lucas averaged 15.2 PPG and 10.8 RPG in his first two seasons in the ABA before joining the Portland Trail Blazers in 1976. In his first season with the team, Lucas averaged 20.2 PPG, 11.4 RPG, and 2.9 APG while making the All-Star team and helping the Blazers win the 1977 NBA championship as an enforcer who averaged 21.2 PPG, 9.9 RPG, 4.2 APG, 1.5 SPG, and 1.2 BPG during that year’s postseason run. Lucas was still really good in his next two seasons with the team as he averaged 18.4 PPG, 9.8 RPG, and 2.8 APG during that span while also having an All-Star selection and All-Defensive selection in each of those two years. After 41 games with the Blazers in the 1979-80 season averaging 14.3 PPG and 7.9 RPG, Lucas was traded to the New Jersey Nets. He did return to the Blazers in his final season as he averaged just 6.1 PPG in 16.3 MPG before retiring. Lucas was a really good defensive enforcer who was very important in helping the Blazers win their only NBA championship, and his jersey would eventually be retired due to his production with the team.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF3: Rasheed Wallace (1996-04)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star

Stats: 16.8 PPG, 7 RPG, 2 APG, 1 SPG, 1.3 BPG

After averaging 10.1 PPG during his rookie season with the Washington Bullets, Rasheed Wallace was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers during the 1996 offseason, and he spent seven-a-half-years with the team. Wallace averaged 14.3 PPG and 6.1 RPG during his first three seasons with the team, but he was even better in his fourth season as he averaged 16.4 PPG and 7 RPG while making the All-Star team and helping the Blazers go to the 2000 Western Conference Finals. Wallace’s stats improved in the three seasons after that as he averaged 18.9 PPG and 7.8 RPG during that span even though his temper on the court got the best of him at times as he even had 41 technical fouls during the 2000-01 season. However, the Blazers were bounced out of the first round in each of those three postseasons, and Wallace was traded in the middle of the 2003-04 season to the Hawks and later to the Pistons from the Hawks after averaging 17 PPG and 6.6 RPG in 45 games with the Blazers that year.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF4: Sidney Wicks (1971-76)**

Accolades w/Team: 4x All-Star, 1971-72 Rookie of the Year

Stats: 22.3 PPG, 10.3 RPG, 4.1 APG, 1.2 SPG, 0.8 BPG

Drafted second overall in the 1971 NBA Draft, Sidney Wicks was a pretty good power forward during his five-year stint with the Trail Blazers. Wicks was really good in his rookie year as he averaged 24.5 PPG, 11.5 RPG, and 4.3 APG while making the All-Star team and winning the Rookie of the Year. While Wicks never reached his full potential after his rookie year, he was still very good over the next four seasons as he averaged 21.8 PPG, 9.9 RPG, and 4.1 APG during that span while making the All-Star team an additional three times. While Wicks put up good numbers, the Blazers never reached the playoffs during any of the five seasons Wicks spent in Portland, and he was traded to the Celtics before the 1976-77 season.

&amp;#x200B;

**C1: Bill Walton (1974-78)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x NBA Champion, 1x Finals MVP, 1x NBA MVP, 2x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 2x All-Defensive 1st Team

Stats: 17.1 PPG, 13.5 RPG, 4.4 APG, 1 SPG, 2.6 BPG

While Bill Walton only played in four seasons with the Trail Blazers due to horrible foot injuries, he was magnificent when he was healthy. Drafted first overall in the 1974 NBA Draft by the Blazers, Walton was very good in his first two seasons, averaging 14.8 PPG, 13 RPG, 4.5 APG, and 2 BPG during that span, but he only played in 86 of a maximum possible 164 games during those two years due to injuries. However, the 1976-77 season would be huge for Walton as he averaged 18.6 PPG, a league-leading 14.4 RPG, 3.8 APG, and a league-leading 3.2 BPG. These stats during that season helped him make his first All-Star team and place second in the MVP voting, but that would not be the end of a magical season for Walton as he led the Trail Blazers to an NBA championship as Walton averaged 18.5 PPG, 19 RPG, and 5.2 APG in six NBA Finals games against the 76ers to earn that year’s Finals MVP. Walton continued his excellent play for the 1977-78 season as he averaged 18.9 PPG, 13.2 RPG, 5 APG, and 2.5 BPG in the 58 games he played in before he suffered a broken foot. However, his production was still enough to win that year’s MVP award, but he never played another game for the Blazers due to foot injuries as he signed with the San Diego Clippers in the 1979 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**C2: Arvydas Sabonis (1995-01, 2002-03)**

Stats: 12 PPG, 7.3 RPG, 2.1 APG, 0.8 SPG, 1.1 BPG

Arvydas Sabonis may have joined the Trail Blazers at the age of 31, but he was still a solid player during his seven seasons in Portland. The 7’3” big man from Lithuania was solid in his first two seasons with the team as he averaged 14 PPG and 8 RPG while shooting 37.3% from three-point land on 1.7 attempts per game. However, his best season as a Portland Trail Blazer came in his third season with them as he averaged 16 PPG, 10 RPG, and 3 APG. Although Sabonis was clearly aging, he was still a solid role player as he averaged 11.3 PPG and 7 RPG over the next three seasons. After sitting out the 2001-02 season as he retired, Sabonis returned for the 2002-03 season where he averaged just 6.1 PPG on 15.5 before retiring for good after that season.

**Analysis**

* I like the starting lineup for this all-time team a lot. Both the starters in the backcourt, Damian Lillard and Brandon Roy, could both score really well during their respective primes but they were also very good playmakers. Although Lillard and Roy were both known for their scoring ability, Drexler is the best scorer on this team as he was a really good dunker who also had a very good jump shot as he was an excellent mid-range shooter that could shoot three-pointers well enough. The frontcourt of Aldridge and Walton is dominant as Aldridge is a really mid-range shooter and post player while Walton can dominate inside the paint and in the post both on offense and on defense.
* This is a pretty underrated second unit compared to other All-Time teams. Porter was an excellent playmaking point guard who'd be a really good backup when Lillard is off the court. There will be a lot of spacing as Porter, Geoff Petrie, Cliff Robinson, and Arvydas Sabonis could all be very good three-point shooters in the modern NBA. Lucas was also a really good player as well in this bench unit as he could inside pretty well and he was a tenacious defender and enforcer.

The first thing that I want to say is that I might have a more bias as intended as I am a warrior fan and I’m a huge Stephen Curry fan. 

Most people seem to think that Steph is around top 15 to top 20 and in my opinion he is on the higher side of top 15. There are only nine players in NBA history who have at least 2 rings and at least 2 mvps and they are

Kareem
Michael
Bill Russell
Wilt
Lebron
Magic
Larry Bird
Tim Duncan 
Stephen Curry 

Everyone on this list except for Steph is usually considered top ten of all time and there’s only nine players of this list. 

Assuming Steph wins his third mvp and we made the requirement 3 rings and 3 mvps, the list would look like this.

Kareem
Michael
Bill
Lebron
Magic
Larry Bird
Stephen Curry 

Every player on this list except for Steph is usually in consideration for top 5 all time and Steph is right there with them. 

This makes me believe he should be on the top ten all time list because there aren’t even 10 players in nba history that would have accomplish what he has and he has more accolades that I haven’t listed. 

For me he would be in the top ten list and I would like to know what you guys think.",True,False,,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,63714,public,self,"If Stephen Curry wins a third MVP, should he be considered top ten all time?",0,1566268881,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cruu4l/if_stephen_curry_wins_a_third_mvp_should_he_be/,,,,,,,,,,,,

All time Lebron Team: Rules, Select 1 player from all of each 16 teams Lebron has played on (12 man roster, 4 injured reserve). No duplicates of players. See how good this team would be. Player selected is for that season (e.g. no prime Shaq).

First Cleveland Stint
03-04: Carlos Boozer 15.5/11.4/2.0/9.4WS – Typically PF, Great one year pick as famously left for Utah.
04-05: Drew Gooden 14.4/9.2/1.6/8.1WS – Filling the Boozer role, but a bit worse.
05-06: Zydrunas Ilgauskas 15.6/7.6/1.2/8.7WS –  Center, could have been for the other years too, but good year for him and others were not good this year (minus LeBron of course).
06-07: Anderson Varejão 6.8/6.7/0.9/6.6WS – PF/C, A sad pick, but the other good seasons were Good and Ilgauskas
07-08: Daniel Gibson 10.4/2.3/2.5/4.1WS – Finally a (combo) guard. Still nowhere near all-star level, the worst win shares easily so far.
08-09: Mo Williams 17.8/3.4/4.1/9.8WS – Finally a good guard, with this season being better easily than his next one
09-10: Shaquille O’Neal 12/6.7/1.5/3.1WS – Center, fuck it. Anyone with any productivity is gone anyway. Jamison would probably have made it if he weren’t even more injured than Shaq.

Heat Years – This becomes a balancing act of when to take Wade and Bosh, and who else to get in the other years.
10-11: Dwayne Wade 25.5/6.4/4.6/12.8WS – SG. Best teammate of LeBron’s by far to that point. This was his best Miami year and there was not another great (non Bosh) performance to bother moving it away.
11-12: Mario Chalmers 9.8/2.7/3.5/4.3WS (lockout year) – PG. Good this year and the next 3. I would not object to him being put anywhere within them.
12-13: Chris Bosh 16.6/6.8/1.7 9WS – PF/C – Second best LeBron teammate so far. Quite consistent throughout 4 years. Slightly better than in 13-14 season, and the next player doesn’t need athleticism as much to impact the game…
13-14: Ray Allen 9.6/2.8/2.0/4.1WS – SG – Off of a top 5 shot of all time, what people forget is Allen was still productive in bulk, playing 26 minutes per game the last day of his career.

Honorable Mention: (Yes, Cleveland gets none). Shane Battier (11-14), James Jones (10-11), Birdman (13-14).

Second Cleveland Years: Similarly here, gotta pick Kyrie and Love, the rest, who knows.

14-15: Kyrie Irving 21.7/3.2/5.2/10.4WS – PG, Top 3 LeBron teammate. Arguably best regular season of career.
15-16: J.R. Smith 12.4/2.8/1.7/5.5 WS – SG, as much as I dislike him, embodies the move away from broozers to shooters to surround LeBron well
16-17: Tristan Thompson 8.1/9.2/1/7.3WS – C Not his best year, but slotted here as no one else stepped up. Very consistent over first 3 years.
17-18: Kevin Love 17.6/9.3/1.7 6.4WS – PF/C – Also not his best year but no one else showed up here what so ever.


Laker Year
18-19: JaVale McGee 12/7.5/.7/5.9 WS – At the risk of pissing off everyone, I think this is the year that McGee finally put together his talent with the ability to play hearty minutes. All the young guns were 1-2 years away from being truly productive as evidenced by a LeBron team missing the playoffs.

Starters
Kyrie (14-15)
Wade (10-11)
Battier (cheating; 13-14)
Love (17-18)
Bosh (12-13)

Bench
Boozer (03-04)
Ilgauskas (05-06)
Williams (08-09)
Chalmers (11-12)
Thompson (16-17)
Varejão (06-07)
Smith (15-16)

Reserves
O’Neal (09-10)
Gibson (07-08)
McGee (18-19)
Gooden (04-05)

Final Notes: I had to cheat to add a SF to the team, by replacing Allen with Battier. As it turns out, there aren’t too many other good SFs on a teams with Lebron. I think that this team would stand a great chance at winning a championship; I would put them as the favorite if added to the league now, though not an overwhelming favorite like the Warriors recently were. Main issue is a lack of forward creation. But I think the team is simply talented enough to win.

Mitchell, Fox, Luka   
Ayton, Zion
Ben Simmons  John Collins.  
Boker Sabonis, Tatum. 

These are all listed in tiers. 

On the outside would be JJJ, Ingram, siakim, Murray, gary harris, porzingis, lavine tier.  

Ultimately it's hard for me to truly near with down because there's a lot of things that would come in the question like you could easily look at kristaps porzingis as much higher on the list but due to his injury I think I would probably have to take a guy like gary harris before him.  

As a reminder my list was not based on current skill but more of a projection of how you think this player will impact your team name for the next 2 to 5 years and moving forward.    

My next tier would be DeAngelo Russell and Capela.  I like both of these players but think they are more flawed than the others. 

Now there's a few guys I feel like I would be tempted to make an outside play on.  Spencer Dinwiddie, Caris Lavert, and Trae Young. I feel like their eyes would not be very good maybe like a plus 400 or something like that we didn't think they had good odds of being a good pic especially if you're in the top 15, but they do have a realistic chance of being great players, or at least frosting into a truly good players. Kind of like elite 6th man, change the game potential but not franchise tier player.  Kind of like where modern Eric Bledsoe and khris Middleton fall at times, but in a really good way.  They have high upside. 

It kinda hurts to say this as a Knicks fan but it feels bad for them and to think of teams like the Hornets who have no one you'd include... only hoping to draft someone or having a player catch lightning in a bottle and blossom unexpectedly like Isiah on the Celtics and Gilbert arenas in the past.   

If I'm thinking of that sort of potential there's really no one that comes to mind honestly that's a tear I'll have to think about more. I would be curious to hear other suggestions.

**PG1: Bob Cousy (1950-63)**

Accolades w/Team: 7 Finals Appearances, 6x NBA Champion, 1x NBA MVP, 13x All-Star, 2x All-Star Game MVP, 10x All-NBA 1st Team, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 18.5 PPG, 5.2 RPG, 7.6 APG

Bob Cousy was the greatest point guard during the early days of the NBA, and he played with the Celtics during his entire 13-year career, excluding a short seven-game stint with the Cincinnati Royals during the 1969-70 season. While Cousy was solid in his first year, averaging 15.6 PPG, 6.9 RPG, and 4.9 APG and making the All-Star team, he was a lot better in his second season as he averaged 21.7 PPG, 6.4 RPG, and 6.7 APG which helped him make the All-NBA 1st Team. Cousy solidified himself as the best point guard of the 1950s during the next eight seasons as he averaged 19.6 PPG, 5.6 RPG, and 8.1 APG which helped Cousy make the All-NBA 1st Team in each of those seasons, the Celtics make the Finals four times in that span, winning three times, and Cousy lead the league in assists per game in all eight of those seasons. During his last three seasons as a Celtic, Cousy dropped off a bit, but he was still an All-Star in those three seasons as he averaged 15.7 PPG, 3.5 RPG, 7.4 APG, and helped the Celtics to an NBA championship in each of those three years. After winning the 1963 NBA Finals, Cousy retired as one of the greatest Celtics of all-time as he leads the franchise in total assists.

&amp;#x200B;

**PG2: Jo Jo White (1969-79)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 2x NBA Champion, 1x Finals MVP, 7x All-Star, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 18.4 PPG, 4.3 RPG, 5.1 APG, 1.3 SPG, 0.2 BPG

While Bob Cousy was a point guard most known for his playmaking abilities, Jo Jo White the playmaker wasn’t very enamoring, but he was a high-scoring point guard for the Celtics in the 1970s. After averaging 12.2 PPG as a rookie, White had the best two seasons of his career during his next two seasons as he averaged 22.2 PPG, 5.3 RPG, and 5 APG while making the All-Star team in both of those seasons. Jo Jo White continued to be an All-Star during each of his next five seasons in the NBA as he averaged 18.9 PPG, 4.3 RPG, and 5.7 APG during those five years. During that span, White also won two championships with the team in 1974 and 1976, winning the Finals MVP in the latter one as he averaged 21.7 PPG, 4.3 RPG, and 5.8 APG in six NBA Finals games against the Phoenix Suns. He spent another year-and-a-half in Boston after that, and he was traded to the Golden State Warriors during the 1978-79 season.

&amp;#x200B;

**PG3: Dennis Johnson (1983-90)**

Accolades w/Team: 4 Finals Appearances, 2x NBA Champion, 1x All-Star, 1x All-Defensive 1st Team, 3x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 12.6 PPG, 3.2 RPG, 6.4 APG, 1.2 SPG, 0.4 BPG

The starting point guard of the dominant Celtics teams during the 1980s, Dennis Johnson was a really good playmaker and defender during his seven-year stint in the NBA’s titletown. When the Celtics acquired him during the 1983 offseason, he changed his role as he was now the fourth option on a loaded team. He averaged just 12.6 PPG as a Celtic during the regular season, but he was a lot better in the postseason in a Celtics uniform as he averaged 16.5 PPG, 3.9 RPG, and 6.8 APG in seven postseason appearances and 109 playoff games with the team. During those seven years, Johnson helped Boston reach the NBA Finals four times while helping them win two championships out of those four Finals runs.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG1: John Havlicek (1962-78)**

Accolades w/Team: 8 Finals Appearances, 8x NBA Champion, 1x Finals MVP, 13x All-Star, 4x All-NBA 1st Team, 7x All-NBA 2nd Team, 5x All-Defensive 1st Team, 3x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 20.8 PPG, 6.3 RPG, 4.8 APG, 1.2 SPG, 0.3 BPG

One of the greatest Boston Celtics players of all-time, John “Hondo” Havlicek spent his entire 16-year playing career with the franchise. During the first four seasons of his career, Havlicek was a key role player on a championship squad as he averaged 17.8 PPG and 5.7 RPG during that span. However, Havlicek improved over the next three seasons as he averaged 21.2 PPG and 6.7 RPG to help them win two championships in that span as well as All-Star selections for Hondo in each of those three years. An elite scorer and defender, Havlicek averaged 26.1 PPG, 8 RPG, and 7.1 APG in the four years after Bill Russell retired as he made an All-NBA team and All-Defensive team in each of those seasons. While he didn’t win any titles during those four years, Havlicek helped the Celtics win another NBA Championship in 1974 as he won Finals MVP by averaging 26.4 PPG, 7.7 RPG, and 4.7 APG in seven games against the Milwaukee Bucks. Although it was clear Havlicek’s stats were worse in his last four years, he still averaged 17.5 PPG, made the All-Star team, and helped the Celtics win another NBA title in 1976. Havlicek retired in 1978 from playing, but he is still the all-time leading scorer for the Celtics forty years later.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG2: Sam Jones (1957-69)**

Accolades w/Team: 11 Finals Appearances, 10x NBA Champion, 5x All-Star, 3x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 17.7 PPG, 4.9 RPG, 2.5 APG

Sam Jones was a clutch performer and scorer on many of the Celtics’ championship squads of the 1960s as he spent his entire 12-year playing career in Beantown. After averaging 4.6 PPG as a rookie, Jones was a solid role player during the next three seasons as he averaged 12.6 PPG and 5.5 APG during that span. Jones’s role increased on the Celtics over the next three seasons as he averaged 19.2 PPG, 5.2 RPG, and 2.9 APG during a span in which he made the All-Star team twice and helped the Celtics win the championship three more times in addition to the three he won in his first four seasons. During the next four seasons, Jones had an even bigger role as he emerged as one of the better scorers in the NBA as he averaged 23.3 PPG, 5 RPG, and 3 APG while making the All-Star team three times and helping the Celtics win another three championships. Averaging 16.3 PPG and helping the Celtics to another championship in 1969, Jones rode off into the sunset, with fellow Celtics great Bill Russell, as one of only two players to win at least 10 NBA Championships.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG3: Bill Sharman (1951-61)**

Accolades w/Team: 5 Finals Appearances, 4x NBA Champion, 8x All-Star, 1955 All-Star Game MVP, 4x All-NBA 1st Team, 3x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 18.1 PPG, 3.9 RPG, 3 APG

One of the best sharpshooters of the early days of the NBA, Bill Sharman played for the Boston Celtics for ten years. After averaging 10.7 PPG in his first season in Beantown, Sharman was a really good scorer for the next four seasons, averaging 17.6 PPG which helped make the All-Star team in each of those four seasons, and he even led the NBA in free-throw percentage in all four of those years. However, Sharman’s best seasons with the Celtics happened over the next four seasons, three of which resulted in championships, as he averaged 20.7 PPG which helped him make the All-Star team in all of those four seasons. After Sharman averaged 16 PPG in his final season and helped the Celtics win another championship, he retired from playing and went into coaching, although not for the Celtics.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF1: Larry Bird (1979-92)**

Accolades w/Team: 5 Finals Appearances, 3x NBA Champion, 2x Finals MVP, 3x NBA MVP, 12x All-Star, 1982 All-Star Game MVP, 1979-80 Rookie of the Year, 9x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 3x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 24.3 PPG, 10 RPG, 6.3 APG, 1.7 SPG, 0.8 BPG

While Larry Bird was drafted by the Celtics sixth overall in the 1978 NBA Draft, he would not play for the team until 1979 where he’d play for his entire 13-year playing career in the NBA. Larry Legend had a really good rookie season as he averaged 21.3 PPG, 10.4 RPG, and 4.5 APG en route to an All-Star selection and the Rookie of the Year award. Bird continued to make the All-Star team in each of his next four seasons as he averaged 23 PPG, 10.7 PPG, and 5.9 APG during that span in which he helped the team win two championships. Bird won Finals MVP in the 1984 NBA Finals as he averaged 27.4 PPG, 14 RPG, and 3.6 APG in seven games against the Lakers. In the next four seasons, Bird played even better as he averaged 28.1 PPG, 9.7 RPG, and 6.8 APG, won an MVP in 1986 and even helped the Celtics win an NBA championship that year as he averaged 24 PPG, 9.7 RPG, and 9.5 APG in six games against the Rockets. However, Bird only played in six games during the 1988-89 season due to injury, and he was never the same after that due to back problems. Bird still averaged 21.6 PPG, 9.2 RPG, and 7.2 APG in his final three seasons, but with his back problems, it was clear he was not the same player he once was. Bird retired in 1992, but he was simply a legend as he is arguably a Top 5 player in NBA history and was an exceptional all-around small forward.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF2: Paul Pierce (1998-13)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 1x NBA Champion, 1x Finals MVP, 10x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 3x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 21.8 PPG, 6 RPG, 3.9 APG, 1.4 SPG, 0.6 BPG

Spending 15 very productive seasons with the Boston Celtics, it’s simply “The Truth” that Paul Pierce is one of the greatest Boston Celtics of all-time. Pierce averaged 18.3 PPG and 5.8 RPG during his first two seasons, but he broke out in his third season while averaging 25.3 PPG and 6.4 RPG in all 82 games despite being stabbed 11 times around a month before the start of that season. Pierce was a really good scorer during the next six seasons as he averaged 24.7 PPG, 6.7 RPG, and 4.3 APG during that span in which he made the All-Star team five times. After the 2006-07 season where they missed the playoffs, the Celtics decided to trade for fellow All-Stars Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett to help Pierce. His stats decreased in the 2007-08 season, averaging 19.6 PPG, but he was still an All-Star and helped the Celtics win their 17th NBA Championship as a franchise that year as Pierce averaged 21.8 PPG, 4.5 RPG, and 6.3 APG while winning the Finals MVP. Pierce continued to be an All-Star in the next four seasons as he averaged 19.3 PPG on an Eastern Conference contender during that span. While he averaged 18.6 PPG in the 2012-13 season, he and the team were aging, and he was traded with KG to the Nets during the 2013 offseason in one of the worst trades in NBA history.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF1: Kevin McHale (1980-93)**

Accolades w/Team:5 Finals Appearances, 3x NBA Champion, 7x All-Star, 2x Sixth Man of the Year, 1x All-NBA 1st Team, 3x All-Defensive 1st Team, 3x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 17.9 PPG, 7.3 RPG, 1.7 APG, 0.4 SPG, 1.7 BPG

Another Celtic lifer, Kevin McHale had a very productive 13-year tenure with the franchise. McHale came off the bench for the majority of the time in his first five seasons as he averaged 15.2 PPG and 6.9 RPG during that span while also helping the Celtics win two championships. After averaging 19.1 PPG and 8.2 RPG during the last two seasons of that five-year duration, McHale became a regular starter for the 1985-86 season, a role he’d maintain for four seasons. During those four years, McHale was one of the best power forwards and second-options in the NBA as he averaged 23.2 PPG and 8.7 RPG during that span as he made the All-Star team in each of those seasons while also helping the Celtics win a championship in 1986 and leading the NBA in field-goal percentage twice. McHale returned to his bench role after the 1988-89 season, but he still averaged 19.8 PPG and 7.7 RPG during the next two years while making the All-Star team both times. After averaging just 10.7 PPG in his final season with the team, McHale retired as he was now 35 years old at that time.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF2: Kevin Garnett (2007-13)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 1x NBA Champion, 5x All-Star, 2007-08 Defensive Player of the Year, 1x All-NBA 1st Team, 3x All-Defensive 1st Team, 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 15.7 PPG, 8.3 RPG, 2.7 APG, 1.2 SPG, 1 BPG

The Boston Celtics acquired Kevin Garnett during the 2007 offseason to help form a “Big Three” with him, Paul Pierce, and Ray Allen. Garnett sacrificed his accolades for the team’s success and averaged 18.8 PPG and 9.2 RPG while winning the Defensive Player of the Year and helping the Celtics win an NBA championship. Garnett’s stats did decrease even more in the next five seasons after that 2008 championship run as he averaged 15.1 PPG and 8.1 RPG during that span. While KG’s stats decreased and injuries hampered him to a small extent, his defense was still really good as he still made the All-Star team an additional four times. While Garnett made the All-Star team in 2013, he was approaching 37 years old, and he was traded with Pierce in the 2013 offseason to the Boston Celtics in one of the NBA’s worst trades of all-time.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF3: Tom Heinsohn (1956-65)**

Accolades w/Team: 9 Finals Appearances, 8x NBA Champion, 6x All-Star, 1956-57 Rookie of the Year, 4x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 18.6 PPG, 8.8 RPG, 2 APG

Drafted with a territorial selection in the 1956 NBA Draft, Tom Heinsohn spent his entire nine-year playing career with the Boston Celtics. Heinsohn was really good in his rookie year as he averaged 16.2 PPG and 9.8 RPG which helped him make the All-Star team, win Rookie of the Year, and the Celtics to win their first NBA championship. Heinsohn was a very good scorer in the post as well as a really good rebounder in the next five seasons as he averaged 20.4 PPG and 10 RPG during that span in which he made the All-Star team twice and helped the Celtics win another four seasons. After the 1961-62 season, his averages slightly dipped in his final three seasons, but he still averaged 16.5 PPG and 6.5 RPG in that span while making the All-Star team and winning the championship in all of those three seasons. Heinsohn retired after the 1964-65 season, but he’s still with the franchise to this day as he helps announce home games for the Celtics right now.

&amp;#x200B;

**C1: Bill Russell (1956-69)**

Accolades w/Team: 12 Finals Appearances, 11x NBA Champion, 5x NBA MVP, 12x All-Star, 1963 All-Star Game MVP, 3x All-NBA 1st Team, 8x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-Defensive 1st Team

Stats: 15.1 PPG, 22.5 RPG, 4.3 APG

Bill Russell wasn’t too much of a scorer, but he was an exceptional rebounder, defender, and probably the greatest winner of all-time. Russell was really good in his rookie season as he averaged 14.7 PPG and 19.6 RPG while leading the Celtics to their first NBA championship. As one of the greatest rebounders of all-time, Russell averaged more than 20 RPG in each of the ten seasons after his rookie year. During the ten years after his rookie year, Russell averaged 15.9 PPG and 23.3 RPG while making the All-Star team all ten of those times, and leading the Celtics to eight championships in those ten years from 1957-67. Bill Russell was so dominant during the postseason as he averaged 16.2 PPG and 24.9 RPG in 165 postseason games that the NBA named the Finals MVP award after him. While Russell never won the Finals MVP award that was established in his final season, Russell probably would have had 10 Finals MVP had the award existed back in his prime. As arguably the greatest center of all-time, Russell was the only player to have more championships than fingers despite playing in a relatively weak era. However, he dominated over probably the greatest scorer of his era in Wilt Chamberlain as he only won the championship twice (one after Russell retired) compared to **11** for Russell.

&amp;#x200B;

**C2: Dave Cowens (1970-80)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 2x NBA Champion, 1x NBA MVP, 8x All-Star, 1973 All-Star Game MVP, 1970-71 Rookie of the Year, 3x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-Defensive 1st Team, 2x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Drafted fourth overall by the Boston Celtics in the 1970 NBA Draft, Dave Cowens was the next great center to play for the franchise after Bill Russell’s retirement. Cowens had a dominant rookie season as he averaged 17 PPG and 15 RPG to help him win Rookie of the Year, and an even better sophomore season as he upped those averages to 18.8 PPG and 15.2 RPG en route to an All-Star selection. Cowens was even better in his third season than he was in his sophomore season as he averaged 20.5 PPG and 16.2 RPG to help him win the 1973 NBA MVP award despite only making the All-NBA 2nd Team. Cowens continued to be a force in his next five seasons as he averaged 18.8 PPG and 15 RPG while making the All-Star team in each of those five seasons and helping the Celtics win two championships during the 1970s. However, injuries involving his ankles and feet forced Cowens into retirement at the age of 31 despite making the All-Star team in his final season while averaging 14.2 PPG and 8.1 RPG.

&amp;#x200B;

**C3: Robert Parish (1980-94)**

Accolades w/Team: 5 Finals Appearances, 3x NBA Champion, 9x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 16.5 PPG, 10 RPG, 1.5 APG, 0.8 SPG, 1.5 BPG

After four solid seasons with the Golden State Warriors, Robert Parish was traded to the Boston Celtics where he dominated at center for fourteen seasons with the franchise. Despite being the third option on the contending Celtics teams of the 1980s, he was a really good scorer and rebounder for the team. Parish had 11 years from 1980-91 with the franchise where he was really productive as he averaged 17.5 PPG and 10.4 RPG while making the All-Star team eight times and helping the Celtics win three championships. Parish’s stats weren’t the most impressive, but he was still critical to the Celtics of the 1980s as he formed a trio with fellow All-Star Kevin McHale and superstar Larry Bird. The Chief’s stats declined in his final three years in Beantown, averaging 12.8 PPG and 8.6 RPG, and he signed with the Hornets in the 1994 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**C4: Ed Macauley (1950-56)**

Accolades w/Team: 6x All-Star, 1951 All-Star Game MVP, 3x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 18.9 PPG, 8.1 RPG, 3.7 APG

Ed Macauley was never a champion nor an outstanding rebounder during his six seasons with the Celtics, but he was one of the most efficient centers of the early days of the NBA. Macauley was really good in his first five seasons with the team as he averaged 19.3 PPG and 8.5 RPG while shooting 45.3% from the field, which was really high for his period as he led the NBA in field-goal percentage twice during that span. Macauley was still very good in his sixth season with the team, averaging 17.5 PPG and 5.9 RPG and making the All-Star team despite the decline in stats. However, the Celtics never got over the hump with Macauley, and he was shipped to St. Louis after the 1955-56 season in a deal that sent the draft rights of Bill Russell to Boston.

**TL;DR All-Time Kings Roster**

||Starters|Reserves|
|:-|:-|:-|
|PG|**Bob Cousy**|Jo Jo White, Dennis Johnson|
|SG|**John Havlicek**|Sam Jones, Bill Sharman|
|SF|**Larry Bird**|Paul Pierce|

|C|**Bill Russell**|Dave Cowens, Robert Parish, Ed Macauley|
||*Head Coach*|*Assistant Coaches*|
|Coaching Staff|Red Auerbach|Tom Heinsohn, K.C. Jones|

**Analysis**

* The identity of this team is 1000% winning. Most, if not all, of these players, were winners as 14 out of the 15 players on this won at least one championship with the Celtics. Not only that but all 15 players on the roster made/will make the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame as players.
* I like the starting lineup all-around. Cousy is an excellent playmaker who can pass to Havlicek, Bird, or McHale for easy buckets. Not only that but Cousy was also an excellent scorer and Bird was an excellent playmaker. Bill Russell wasn't ultra-productive offensively, but he more than made up for that with his exceptional defense and rebounding. There are no weak links when it comes to rebounding and defense in the starting five as all of Cousy, Havlicek, Bird, McHale, and Parish were really good when it came to the boards and defense.
* The bench is one of the best out of all the All-Time teams as well. There are lots of very good scorers in the second unit like White, Jones, Pierce, and Cowens. Although White wasn't that impressive as a playmaker, he was still pretty good at it and he'll pass the ball to teammates when they're open. It's also not going to be that easy scoring on that second unit's frontcourt as Garnett and Cowens were both really good defenders.

I’ve been a solid NBA fan since 2009-2010 starting with the Charlotte Bobcats (I know...) and Orlando Magic. 

So my question is quite simple, what makes Michael Jordan the “GOAT”? Looking at a few big stat categories over every players career show that Jordan isn’t #1. For example; Kareem is 1st in career points, Jordan is 5th / Stockton is 1st in career steals, Jordan is 3rd / Stockton is 1st in assists, Jordan is 45th. When it comes to accolades and championships, Jordan leads one category, Finals MVP with six. Bill Russell has the most championships with 11, Jordan is tied for 10th with six / Kareem is in 1st for regular season MVPs with six, Jordan is tied for 2nd with five / Kareem, Duncan, Kobe, and LeBron are tied all time with All-NBA selections at 15 each, Jordan is tied for 12th with 11.

So what makes Michael Jordan the “GOAT”? Could it be broken down to a “GOAT” of each decade or era?

In my POV he has not passed Duncan, Shaq, or Kareem yet, and most times I don't have him above Magic either. 

I see a lot of people saying Jordan, Duncan, and Shaq had so much help. I don't believe they did. I believe they were a major part in creating their help. Pippen was a draft night acquisiton from seattle. He was never a sure thing. Kobe a draft night acquisition from charlotte, never a sure thing. Duncan won with mid or late first and second rounders, there was no sure thing on any of their teams. Magic is the only other top guy that got to play with a sure thing. Magic threatened to stay in school if he didn't go to LA and play with Kareem. 

Anyways, I don't get how guys can lose points because they are coachable, and they play in a way that fosters team growth. Pippen is not Pippen as we know him if he is stuck next to lebron. Lebron just isn't a floor spacer and he does not have the range outside of the paint that MJ does. He might only be ahead in threes just due to volume in this era. MJ shot and made 6 threes when they said he just didn't have that ability, and he did that in the finals and just shrugged at his naysayers. Lebron needs his wing shooters so he can do his simple drive and kick game. There is no intricacy to his offenses, which is why he has lost 6 finals and counting now. Parker and Ginobili are not what we know them as, if they played next to lebron. Shaq couldnt be Shaq if he played with lebron, as lebron's game does not allow for any dominant center to clog the paint on his drives, and does not allow for nonshooters to contribute in other ways like MJ did, Duncan did, and even Curry did. 

Then people turn around and say they had more help than lebron. Well they played in a way that allowed their teammates to excel and not just be spot up shooters. How is that a knock against them? At the level of being an NBA player, not much separates the All time GOATs from stars/superstars. I'm not speaking about the Jimmer's, Jared Dudley's, Jeryl Sasser's, Kerry Kittles type of guys. I'm talking about The Dwight Howards, Tmacs, Iversons, Westbrooks, Wilts, Jordans,Shaq's, David Robinsons, Karl Malones,  Kobes, Duncans, Lebrons, Wades, etc. At the athlete level, those guys are phenomenal. All 1st tier guys in athletics. Why Iverson isn't as great a PG or SG as Kidd or Jordan, was his mentality. Russ is a beast, but the way he plays limits him as a viable candidate to lead a team to a title, not anything else really. He has the body, speed, athleticism. Dwight held himself back with the way he played. In my opinion, Lebron too.

He Had the luxury on mulitple occasions of letting guys run their own teams for 3 years, 5 years, 7 years etc and then joining up with him. There was no growth like you saw with Jordan's Bulls, Duncan's Spurs, Curry's warriors pre durant. Lebron needs a finished product. How many times do we hear ""He needs vets, get rid of the young guys. He needs more help. You know he needs shooters, why is Rondo there?"" Same story every time. He gets what he asks for and still has an out as far as excuses go. The elbow, the AC, the broken hand, and his latest paid shill saying he played through ""so much pain"" when he missed the playoffs. He can't take an L gracefully at all. 

I'm not penalizing guys in the all time rankings because they were superstars with accolades to back them up, and they were able to foster team growth, evolution, and win without all the antics and excuses we currently see for today's superstar players, especially lebron. I don't think any of those guys had more help than lebron, their playstyle is what set them apart and got the results you see right now. That's an integral part of what separates players, that can't get thrown out the window.

It is really close, and I don't think you can go wrong building your franchise around any three of these guys.",True,False,,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,63654,public,self,Mitchell vs. Tatum vs. Fox,0,1566260957,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cre577/mitchell_vs_tatum_vs_fox/,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of those 380, 60 became decent (&gt;36%) or better three-point shooters over the rest of their career. 

Caveats: this leaves out players who had 1 or 2 good 3P shooting seasons over the rest of their career, but were still meh (ex. Lebron, because it looks at the entirety of the rest of their career), players who rarely shot threes early and then poured them in late (ex. Brook Lopez, because of the 1 3PA/G filter).

There are also some players who might be in the midst of a single-season outlier, for example Jerian Grant.

Data retrieved from basketball reference, organized and stuff with Excel. Probably made some mistakes, let me know if anything jumps out.

* To find a top 10, something beyond simple three-point percentage was necessary. As the shot has gained more acceptance, players have become better at it, and we have to account for increased effectiveness over time.

* **Take the player's points per shot on three-point attempts and subtract the league-average points per three-pointer during the relevant time period. Then, multiply by the number of attempts.**

* If a player shoots 45 percent on 100 threes, he's getting 1.35 points per attempt. Say the league average is 35 percent, or 1.05 points per attempt. The shooter is 0.3 points above average per attempt. Multiply that by the 100 attempts and you'd have 30 points above average.

**PG1: Oscar Robertson (1960-70)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x NBA MVP, 10x All-Star, 3x All-Star Game MVP, 1960-61 Rookie of the Year, 9x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 29.3 PPG, 8.5 RPG, 10.3 APG

Drafted first overall by the then-Cincinnati Royals in the 1960 NBA Draft out of the University of Cincinnati, Oscar Robertson was the greatest player to play for the Royals/Kings franchise as well as the greatest point guard during the 1960s. Robertson had one of the greatest rookie seasons in NBA history as he averaged 30.5 PPG, 10.1 RPG, and a league-leading 9.7 APG en route to an All-Star appearance, the Rookie of the Year award, and a selection to the All-NBA 1st Team. He followed that up with an even better sophomore campaign where he averaged 30.8 PPG, 12.5 RPG, and 11.4 APG, which would be the only single-season where an NBA player averaged a triple-double until Russell Westbrook in the 2016-17 season. Robertson continued to be an excellent scorer, rebounder, and playmaker for the next three seasons as he averaged 30 PPG, 9.8 RPG, and 10.6 during that span which included 3 All-NBA 1st Team selections as well as the MVP in the 1963-64 season. However, after the 1964-65 season, Robertson’s rebounding numbers went down as he averaged 28.2 PPG, 6.5 RPG, and 9.9 APG over the next five seasons. Despite the decrease in rebounding numbers for those five seasons, Robertson still made the All-NBA 1st Team in four of those years and led the league in assists an additional three times. While Robertson continued to dominate, the Royals were losing, and they traded an unhappy Robertson to the Bucks after the 1969-70 season.

&amp;#x200B;

**PG2: Nate Archibald (1970-76)**

Accolades w/Team: 3x All-Star, 3x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 25.2 PPG, 2.8 RPG, 8.1 APG, 1.5 SPG, 0.1 BPG

Drafted 19th overall in the 1970 NBA Draft, Nate Archibald was selected to be the future franchise point guard of the former Cincinnati Royals after they traded Oscar Robertson. After a solid rookie season in which he averaged 16 PPG, Archibald had an All-NBA campaign in his second season as he averaged 28.2 PPG and 9.2 APG. However, his third season, which would be the first year in which the franchise was in Kansas City as the Kings, the “Tiny” 6’1” point guard had an exceptional season as he averaged 34 PPG and 11.4 APG, which was good enough to lead the league in both categories and place third in the MVP voting. After injuring his Achilles tendon in his fourth season, Tiny was still really good in his next two seasons as he averaged 25.7 PPG, 7.3 APG, and 1.5 SPG and was selected to the All-NBA team both times. However, before the 1976-77 season, Archibald was traded to the Nets, but he excelled in his six seasons with the Royals/Kings.

&amp;#x200B;

**PG3: Bob Davies (1948-55)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x NBA Champion, 4x All-Star, 4x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 14.3 PPG, 2.9 RPG, 4.9 APG

Although Bob Davies did not play in the NBA until he was 29 years old, he was still a very good point guard during his seven-year stint with the Rochester Royals. In his very first season in the league, Davies averaged 15.1 PPG and a league-leading 5.4 APG. Davies remained a consistent point guard for the next six seasons as he averaged 14.2 PPG, 2.9 RPG, and 4.8 APG in that span where he made the All-Star team four times. Davies was also the floor general of the 1951 NBA Champion Royals as he averaged 17 PPG during that year’s NBA Finals against the Knicks in seven games.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG1: Mitch Richmond (1991-98)**

Accolades w/Team: 6x All-Star, 1995 All-Star Game MVP, 3x All-NBA 2nd Team, 2x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 23.3 PPG, 3.7 RPG, 4.1 APG, 1.3 SPG, 0.3 BPG

As a Warriors fan, I do watch a lot of Mitch Richmond highlights from when he was on Run-TMC, but he had his best seasons as a member of the Sacramento Kings. After averaging 22.7 PPG during his three seasons with the Warriors, Richmond was traded to the Kings before the 1991-92 season. After averaging 22.5 PPG during his first season with the Kings, Richmond would make the All-Star team during each of his next six seasons with the team. During that span, he averaged 23.5 PPG, 3.7 RPG, and 3.9 APG and made the All-NBA Team during five of those six years. While he had similar statistics with both the Kings and the Warriors, Richmond was a lot better at three-point shooting with the Kings as he shot 40.4% from three-point land on 4.8 attempts per game compared to 35.7% from three on 1.3 attempts per game as a Warrior. While Richmond scored so well, the Kings only made the playoffs once in his seven seasons, and he was traded to the Washington Wizards during the 1998 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG2: Bobby Wanzer (1948-57)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x NBA Champion, 5x All-Star, 3x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 12.2 PPG, 4.5 RPG, 3.2 APG

Bobby Wanzer was an excellent shooter during his nine-year stint with the Rochester Royals. Although Wanzer did not play his first NBA game until he was 27 years old, he was still a solid player during his first three seasons with the team as he averaged 11 PPG during that span, and even helped the Royals win an NBA championship in 1951 as their starting shooting guard. After that championship run, Wanzer had his best season as a pro in the 1951-52 season as he averaged 15.7 PPG, made the All-Star team and All-NBA 2nd Team, and led the NBA in free-throw percentage, shooting 90.4% from the charity stripe. Wanzer continued to make the All-Star team in each of the next four seasons as he averaged 12.8 PPG during that span. However, he started to decline at 35 years old as he averaged just 3.9 PPG on 7.6 MPG in his final season before he decided to retire.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG3: Otis Birdsong (1977-81)**

Accolades w/Team: 3x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 21.2 PPG, 3.6 RPG, 2.9 APG, 1.4 SPG, 0.2 BPG

Drafted second overall in the 1977 NBA Draft by the Kansas City Kings, Otis Birdsong was an excellent scorer during his four seasons with the team. After averaging 15.8 PPG during his rookie year, Birdsong emerged as an All-Star during each of the next two seasons as he averaged 22.2 PPG during that span. However, Birdsong had an even better fourth and final season in Kansas City as he averaged a career-high 24.6 PPG while shooting 54.4% from the field which helped him make the All-Star team again as well as the All-NBA 2nd Team. However, Birdsong averaged just 15.5 PPG in eight postseason games in 1981, and he would go to the Nets in the offseason through a sign-and-trade deal.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF1: Jack Twyman (1955-66)**

Accolades w/Team: 6x All-Star, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 19.2 PPG, 6.6 RPG, 2.3 APG

After being drafted eighth overall by the Rochester Royals in the 1955 NBA Draft, Jack Twyman spent all 11 seasons of his career with the franchise in both Rochester and Cincinnati. Twyman was a solid player during his first three seasons as he averaged 16 PPG and 5.9 RPG during that span in which he made the All-Star team twice. During the last of those seasons, the 1957-58 season, he led the NBA in field-goal percentage at 45.2% from the field. Twyman was even better during the next five seasons with averages of 24.9 PPG and 8.4 RPG as well as four All-Star appearances and two All-NBA selections. While Twyman retired in 1966 after averaging just 7.4 PPG in his final season, his legacy will forever be remembered as he was an exceptional scorer on the court and a great guy off the court as he became the legal guardian of his former teammate, Maurice Stokes, after he got paralyzed due to a head injury that led to seizures.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF2: Peja Stojakovic (1998-06)**

Accolades w/Team: 3x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 18.3 PPG, 5 RPG, 2 APG, 1 SPG, 0.1 BPG

Drafted right after Kobe Bryant in the 1996 NBA Draft, Peja Stojakovic played in seven-and-a-half seasons with the Sacramento Kings. Peja entered the league in 1999 and was a solid player off the bench in his first two seasons, averaging 10.5 PPG. However, the Serbian sharpshooter emerged as one of the best three-point shooters in the NBA during his next five seasons with averages of 21.1 PPG, 5.5 RPG, and 2.2 APG during that span in which he made the All-Star team three times and shot 40.8% from the three-point line on 5.7 attempts per game. Stojakovic was traded to the Pacers during the 2005-06 season, but he left as the leader in three-pointers made for the Sacramento Kings and still has the most three-pointers in the history of the franchise.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF1: Jerry Lucas (1963-69)**

Accolades w/Team: 6x All-Star, 1965 All-Star Game MVP, 1963-64 Rookie of the Year, 3x All-NBA 1st Team, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 19.6 PPG, 19.1 RPG, 3 APG

Drafted by the Cincinnati Royals with a territorial selection in the 1962 NBA Draft, Jerry Lucas did not join the Royals until 1963, but he was really good in a little over six seasons with the franchise. During his rookie season, Lucas was exceptional, averaging 17.7 PPG and 17.4 RPG, shooting a league-leading 52.7% from the field, to help him make the All-Star team, All-NBA 2nd Team, and win Rookie of the Year. Lucas was one of the best power forwards in the NBA during the mid-1960s as he averaged 20.5 PPG and 19.8 RPG over the next four seasons where he was selected to the All-NBA 1st Team three times. Lucas was still an All-Star the very next season, but after 4 games in the season after that, he was traded to the San Francisco Warriors. However, Lucas gets the starting power forward for this all-time team as he was a really good rebounder and jump shooter.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF2: Chris Webber (1998-05)**

Accolades w/Team: 4x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 1st Team, 3x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 23.5 PPG, 10.6 RPG, 4.8 APG, 1.5 SPG, 1.5 BPG

Acquired by the Kings during the 1998 offseason, Chris Webber was really good during his six-and-a-half-year tenure with the franchise. During his first season with the Kings, which was the 1999 lockout season, C-Webb averaged 20 PPG and a league-leading 13 RPG en route for a selection on the All-NBA 2nd Team. His next four campaign would all be All-Star selections as he averaged 24.8 PPG, 10.6 RPG, 4.7 APG, 1.5 SPG, and 1.5 BPG, including an exceptional 2000-01 season where he averaged 27.1 PPG, 11.1 RPG, 4.2 APG, 1.3 SPG, and 1.7 SPG to help him place fourth in the MVP voting. However, a torn ACL during the 2003 postseason against the Mavericks caused his 2003-04 season to be shortened, and Webber wasn’t the same player after that. He was traded during the 2004-05 season to the Philadelphia 76ers, but Webber had quite a legacy with the Kings and could have won an NBA championship in 2002 if it weren’t for controversial officiating in Game 6 of the Conference Finals.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF3: Maurice Stokes (1955-58)**

Accolades w/Team: 3x All-Star, 1955-56 Rookie of the Year, 3x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 16.4 PPG, 17.3 RPG, 5.3 APG

Before I do this summary of Maurice Stokes, I would just like to give a shoutout to u/WinesburgOhio over at r/VintageNBA because he knows **A LOT** more about him than I do, so if you want to read more on him, check [it](https://www.reddit.com/r/VintageNBA/comments/brgt5a/maurice_stokes_the_lebrondraymond_hybrid_who_had/) out because I used some of his information to help with my writeup.

While Maurice Stokes only played in three NBA seasons, he was still an exceptional all-around player and an all-time great for the Rochester/Cincinnati Royals. Drafted second overall in the 1955 NBA Draft, Stokes had an exceptional rookie season as he averaged 16.8 PPG, a league-leading 16.3 RPG, and 4.9 APG which helped him make the All-Star team, All-NBA 2nd Team, and win the Rookie of the Year award that year. Stokes had another phenomenal season in his sophomore year as he averaged 15.6 PPG, 17.4 RPG, and 4.6 APG en route to another All-Star and All-NBA selection. In addition, Stokes did even bigger things in his third NBA season as he averaged career-highs in all three statistical categories as he posted an average stat line of 16.9 PPG, 18.1 RPG, and 6.4 APG and even helped the Royals, now in Cincinnati, to the playoffs. In addition to his solid scoring and excellent rebounding and playmaking, Stokes was an exceptional defender on the floor. Sadly, Stokes suffered a concussion during the final game of his third season and was paralyzed a few days after that due to a seizure.

&amp;#x200B;

**C1: DeMarcus Cousins (2010-17)**

Accolades w/Team: 3x All-Star, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 21.1 PPG, 10.8 RPG, 3 APG, 1.4 SPG, 1.2 BPG

Drafted fifth overall by the Sacramento Kings, DeMarcus Cousins was a dominant center during his seven-year stint with the franchise. After averaging a solid 16.3 PPG and 9.8 RPG during his first three seasons with the team, Boogie improved in his fourth season in the NBA, averaging 22.7 PPG and 11.7 RPG and followed this up the next year as he improved by averaging 24.1 PPG and 12.7 RPG en route to an All-NBA selection. For the 2015-16 season, Cousins decided to add the three-point shot in his repertoire, and his scoring increased to 26.9 PPG while also rebounding really well, averaging 11.5 RPG during that season which led to another All-NBA selection. While Cousins would average 27.8 PPG during the first 55 games of the 2016-17 season, the Kings were always a losing franchise when he was there, and he was traded to the Pelicans during the trade deadline. Unfortunately, Cousins has dealt with his fair share of injuries since being traded as he tore his Achilles during the 2017-18 season, ruptured his quad in the 2019 postseason, and tore his ACL just a few days ago while working out.

&amp;#x200B;

**C2: Wayne Embry (1958-66)**

Accolades w/Team: 5x All-Star

Stats: 14.1 PPG, 10.4 RPG, 1.6 APG

Wayne Embry was a very good player during the eight seasons with the Cincinnati Royals. Despite being drafted by the Hawks, the Kings traded for Embry to help replace the production of Maurice Stokes. Embry was a solid player in his first two seasons as he averaged 11 PPG and 9.3 RPG despite averaging just 22.9 MPG. Embry would not miss the All-Star game in each of his next five seasons with the team, which included a span from 1961-64 where he averaged 18.5 PPG and 12.3 RPG. After the final of his five All-Star selections in 1965, Embry’s stats dipped in the 1965-66 season despite being only 28 as he averaged just 7.6 PPG and 6.6 RPG. After that season, Embry retired, although he would unretire, but for the Boston Celtics.

&amp;#x200B;

**C3: Sam Lacey (1970-81)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star

Stats: 11.1 PPG, 10.5 RPG, 4 APG, 1.5 SPG, 1.7 BPG

Drafted fifth overall in the 1970 NBA Draft, Slammin’ Sam Lacey played 11 years for the Kings when they were in Kansas City. Lacey was a really good rebounder while also being a dependable scorer as he averaged 12.8 PPG, 12.5 RPG, 3.3 APG, 1.6 SPG, and 2 BPG during his first six seasons, although he only made one All-Star team in his entire Kings tenure. However, Lacey’s scoring and rebounding slightly dipped in his last five seasons with the team as his averages went down to 9.2 PPG and 8.2 RPG, although his assists went up to 4.9 APG during that span. Two games into the 1981-82 season, Lacey was traded to the Nets, but he is still, to this day, the all-time leading rebounder for the Kings franchise.

&amp;#x200B;

**C4: Arnie Risen (1948-55)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x NBA Champion, 4x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 13.7 PPG, 11.2 RPG, 1.9 APG

Arnie Risen was one of the NBA’s better centers during the early days of the NBA. During the 1948-49 season, which would be his first on the Rochester Royals, Risen averaged 16.6 PPG and shot a league-leading 42.3% from the field. Risen’s averages did go down in his second season to 10.1 PPG, but he was really good in the 1950-51 season as he averaged 16.3 PPG and 12 RPG. During that postseason, Risen helped the Royals win the NBA championship as he averaged 21.7 PPG and 14.3 RPG in seven NBA Finals games against the Knicks. During the next four seasons, Risen made the All-Star team in each of those seasons with averages of 13.3 PPG and 11 RPG in that span. He was sold to the Celtics before the 1955-56 season despite making the All-Star year in his last season with the Royals.

**Analysis**

* This All-Time Kings squad reminds of the All-Time Suns squad. This is an up-tempo offense with an elite playmaker and scorer in Oscar Robertson as the starting point guard as well as a lot of guys to pass to that could be solid to really good three-point shooters like Richmond, Twyman, Lucas, and Cousins (who shot decent from three during his last one-and-a-half seasons as a member of the Kings). Not only would they be great three-point shooters, but all of these guys can score in other ways like Richmond driving for a layup as well as Lucas and Cousins scoring in the post considering all of the starting lineup put up 20+ PPG during his best seasons with the team.
* The second unit is pretty much similar, so you're not missing out on too much offensively, even if the starters are out. Tiny Archibald, like Robertson, can set up his teammates for buckets and score buckets himself too. With guys who would be three-point shooters in today's NBA in Wanzer and Stojakovic as well as a mid-range scorer in Webber and an inside scorer in Embry, Archibald has lots of options when he isn't scoring.
* Like the All-Time Suns, there is not one weak link offensively. There's lots of three-point shooters and scorers as well as some solid playmakers that can score and pass to teammates for scorers. Defensively, there isn't anybody in the first or second unit that was really good other than Lucas who probably can't do all the defensive work.
* Jack Twyman is starting over Peja Stojakovic because he was a better scorer than Peja and I feel that he'd be pretty darn good at shooting three-pointers in today's NBA considering Peja was one of the best three-point shooters of his time. Also, he's a great teammate and will help deal with certain guys like the Big O and Boogie who could both get angry at times.

But even before that I had trouble believing that James would last at PG. Unless Vogel has a brilliant plan to significantly slow down the pace of the game a soon-to-be 35 LeBron James is getting burnt on every possession by guards who will be younger and faster than him. While Danny Green will probably always pick up the opposing team's ball handler I can't imagine James being the primary defender of Buddy Hield, CJ McCollum, D'Angelo Russell, Donovan Mitchell, or the small army of young guards the Nuggets have. And while on offense he's a mismatch for most guards, the Laker's continued lack of a another reliable perimeter scorer (Green was a great signing, but 10 ppg isn't going to demand a lot of attention) means it's simple for teams to rotate their best wing defender onto James.

There are numerous decent players throughout NBA history who never made an All-Star team (or maybe barely made 1) but who would have been more successful in another era. Today's era of 3-pt shooting and more mobile bigs makes you wonder if guys like **Byron Scott, Michael Adams, or Toni Kukoc** would have made some ASG's if they played today. 

Another particularly interesting case is **Lester Selvage**. He was an ABA legend in its first season ('67-68) because he would shoot 3's non-stop. He lead the league in 3's attempted (more than every other team but one) and 3's made, plus he was still efficient enough at them to finish 6th in 3% (32%), yet over the last 2/3 of the season he shot 42%. This was the first season ever of 3-pt line in a real league and the league leader shot 36%, and a guy who never stopped shooting them hit 42% once he got settled.

**[FINAL ROUND VOTING FORM HERE](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/B35ZV35)**

Quick Refresher on the criteria that was used to make the teams and the seedings. 

****

* **Only Players Who Were Selected In the Lotto Era are Eligible**

* **So only players selected from 1985 on are eligible for this exercise. (See previous posts for more explanation as to why)**
  * Only 16 teams will be created, 1 team for each lotto pick and 2 additional teams representing picks 15-30 and the second round

* **Positions and Peak is Taken into Account**

  * Each player is assumed to be at their absolute peak of their powers

* **Teams are seeded by total cumulative Win Shares on the team** 

 * This isn't a perfect method, but it's pretty fair and did a pretty good job of positioning the best teams vs the worst teams. So for example the #1 overall seed is the #1 picks team (no surprise) with a cumulative WS total of  1,412.3 and their match up is the #12 picks team (again no surprise) with a total cumulative WS of 424. This way a team like the second round picks team doesn't have to go against the #1 picks team right away.


********
**RESULTS**

* **Left Side of Bracket**


- **[#1 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cgvtu5/xpost_rnba_all_time_draft_picks_team_1_selection/) (61.3%, 19 votes)** defeated the  [#9 Picks Team] (https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ckbxz5/all_time_nba_draft_team_9_selections/) (38.7%, 12 votes)

 * I have to say I'm pretty surprised by this outcome, I really thought that this would be a much closer matchup. On paper the #1 picks team clearly has more talent, they are loaded with HOFers and MVPs, but the roster construction forces them to play a limited style of basketball. Granted this style would still dominante most teams, but the #9 picks really seemed to be able to not only match the #1 picks size (to a degree), but they also should have been able to exploit that lack of wings on the #1 picks. Still it's hard to argue that a team filled with so many inner circle HOFers (or future HOFers) shouldn't advance. 


****

* **Right Side of Bracket**

-  **[#15-30 First Round Picks Team] (https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cmrcfk/all_time_nba_draft_teams_best_of_the_rest_of_the/) (54.8%, 17 votes)** defeated the [#3 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/chnuk6/all_time_draft_picks_team_3_selection/) (45.2%, 14 votes)

 * This was about as close as I expected, the Non-Lotto firsts team seems to be too deep and the combo of Giannis and Kawhi seems to be just too much for anyone to overcome. I wonder if the results would have been different if this was conducted before the playoffs, but it's hard to really argue either way.



****

**FINAL ROUND MATCHUP**

***


- **[#1 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cgvtu5/xpost_rnba_all_time_draft_picks_team_1_selection/)** vs **[Picks 15-30 First Round Picks](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cmrcfk/all_time_nba_draft_teams_best_of_the_rest_of_the/)**

 * So far the # picks have been a juggernaut, they'eve run away with every contest with their combination of athleticism, size, and All-Time great talent. I think this may be coming to an end with a match-up against the deepest team in the tournament. Given that this is the only game let's really break this down. 
   
      *  At first look I think the size of the #1 picks starters is going to be an issue for the #15-30 picks. Gobert's length may bother Shaq, but Gobert doesn't have the strength needed to prevent Shaq from bullying him in the paint. Gobert will struggle preventing Shaq from getting deep position so limiting entry passes will be crucial. This is where the defensive flexibility of the Non-Lotto Firsts team will come into play. This might be a game where it makes more sense for Nash to sit out and have a lineup of Butler, AK47, Kawhi, and Giannis all playing at the same time. The length and frenetic defensive energy of this lineup will need to limit passing lanes and post entries. The most dangerous play will be the LeBron and Shaq PnR as switching can lead to disaster. Icing the PnR (forcing it to the sideline) will be key as the length of the 15-30 picks can be more suffocating as other wing defenders can sag off of non-shooters. AK47, Butler and either one of Giannis or Kawhi will have to stunt as much as they can. Figuring out a way to prevent this PnR is key for the Non-Lotto Firsts to win. The problem is can they do this against every big that the #1 picks can throw at you? Giannis's ability to guard Duncan is really important, if he can win this matchup then his team can win the game. Duncan guarding Giannis is a really difficult ask, Duncan doesn't have the foot speed to reliably keep up with Giannis, especially on the fast break. AD may be better suited to guard Giannis than Duncan, Duncan will work best as a center vs this team unless for whatever reason they go big with Kemp in at PF next to Vlade or Gobert. 
     * LeBron will have his toughest task yet, with Giannis and Kawhi guarding him all game and if for whatever reason they aren't another freak of nature in AK47 will be on him. He will be smothered constantly, it's the best chance the Non-Lotto Firsts have to win. Dumars, Lowry, and Butler should be able to do a decent job guarding AI, Kyrie, and Rose, although they might struggle trying to contain the speedy guards of the #1 squad. 

 * All in all this is a really fascinating match-up that can go either way

I think it's something that people should consider because I'm not sure the Warriors FO truly thinks they can be championship level without the defense that has made them what they are in the postseason for the past years, or that wing creation they'll lack with no Harrison Barnes/KD. I think that even if their offense is nuclear with Russell (which I'm not entirely convinced of since he's not the most efficient guy in the world) they may look to get a package for him just to bolster their defense if their defense is just terrible with Steph/Russell on the floor. Anyway...

First off, let me start off by saying I know this place is tired of D'lo trade stuff and I'm sure a bunch of warriors fans are going to yell at me, that's fine. I very much welcome being shot down for these ideas because it helps me come up with better ones in the future. But let's get started:

--------------------------------------------------------

TRADE 1: 

**MINNESOTA RECEIVES**: D'Angelo Russell, Jacob Evans, (GRIII if needed for salary) 

**GOLDEN STATE RECEIVES**: Robert Covington, Jeff Teague, Jake Layman

This trade can't be done until after December 15th so it's hard to mock it up in a trade machine with salary matching. 

Why Minnesota does it: Minnesota could finally get another young star (not you, wiggins) to pair with KAT and there was that buzz about them getting Dlo this offseason anyway. They get their wish granted on the free agent they missed out on and get a couple of flyer type players to see what they've got. Dlo is also pretty much on KAT's timeline and if Dlo continues to improve him and Towns could make a playoff push with the right supporting cast in seasons after this coming one. 

Why Golden State does it: Keep in mind I think this only happens if the Dlo experiment is either failing or doesn't look championship quality. I think there's a chance they hold on to russell past the deadline but there's also a chance they see something that works better and jump at it. The following is just my opinion though. I think Golden State as they stand aren't true contenders. I think they won't get past a team like the Clippers or Lakers, and would struggle against the Rockets and maybe even the Jazz. I think their main current problem is that they have no way to become a next level defense as they have been able to in past years. Assuming Covington is the same guy, and Klay is fine, this trade lets them become that again. They can be a great playoff defense instead of having to cover for the deficiencies of Steph and Russell. The only problem here is really that there isn't much creation on the wing so there will be a lot of onus on Steph and Draymond to create at their spots. With this trade the Warriors also get good depth pieces in Teague and Layman who can play backup spots in the postseason and not kill the team when the stars are off the floor. Teague is also an expiring, so hey, more power to them.


--------------------------------------------------------


TRADE 2: 

**PHILADELPHIA RECEIVES**: D'Angelo Russell, salary matching (not sure which players this would be, but they probably won't play in the playoffs for the Sixers) 

**GOLDEN STATE RECEIVES**: Tobias Harris

Why Philadelphia does it: You could say Harris perhaps disappointed a bit in the playoffs last year, and that they could perhaps benefit a bit from having a good ball handling shooter/scorer who can line up next to Ben Simmons and stack the guard spot a little more, especially if you want to slide Richardson down to the 3. You could perhaps argue that Dlo instead of Tobias won't make the defense that much worse than it is with Tobias. Dlo could also potentially be your go to guy in crunch time moments as he's got the skillset to go to work in times like those. 

I'll admit that one is a bit harder to justify but it's one that intrigued me. 

Why Golden State does it: I think this trade really is nice for Golden State as it gives them that wing creator that they've had in all their championship runs again. Their defense would still be questionable, but in all the GSW championships they've had a wing creation element that takes some of the work off steph and draymond. Tobias can feed Steph and Klay for great shots and get his own shot when needed. It'll also let Klay slide back up to the 2 instead of having to work the 3 when Dlo is there. Tobias himself is also a good shooter so you have the splash triplets right there with him and steph/klay. 

--------------------------------------------------------

TRADE 3: 

**ORLANDO RECEIVES**: D'Angelo Russell, Jacob Evans

**GOLDEN STATE RECEIVES**: Aaron Gordon, DJ Augustin, Wesley Iwundu
Why Orlando Does it: Trading away Gordon isn't ideal, but you have to be willing to pay up if you want a guy like Russell, who can be their franchise star going forward and is on the timeline of their other young guys. Add a good wing piece and with Vucevic the magic could be looking at making some consecutive playoff pushes in the east in the coming seasons. 

Why Golden State Does it: I think Aaron Gordon was lowkey one of the better Kawhi defenders in last year's playoffs, just based on my eye test. He can help the defense in the postseason and they're going to need a guy like him to defend the LAs of the world. He has the ability to create for himself and gives them a nice wing presence that they need. Augustin can be  a great backup guard for them, and Iwundu gives them some additional depth, though the Warriors could also try to negotiate for Jonathan Issac instead (doubt the magic will give him up though). 

What do you guys think?

&gt; These two are their young stars. Luka has shown what a great player he can be this last season. He is great play maker and scorer. I seem him continuing to improve in that regard and improve his 3PT shooting and lowering his turnovers. 

&gt; KP has shown his potential and versatility. He is great shooter and can protect the rim with his length. He has gotten better with his 3PT shooting and shot a whooping 39% from the arc at 5 attempts in his 17-18 season. 

&gt; They both have great chemistry and will benefit from each other's skill set. KP never played with such a good play maker and Luka is going to thrive playing next to a big who can stretch the floor and finish at the rim. 

&gt; The addition of Seth Curry is an another great addition to this team. He is one of the best shooters in the league and give the much needed spacing the Mavs require. They shooting should improve as a team with the addition of Seth and the Unicorn. 

&gt; I don't see the team making the playoffs this year though. The west is super stacked and the Mavs are still relatively young. 

###Concerns###

&gt; The obvious concern is KP. He has improved his play every year but also played less and less games every season. The Mavs have him locked up for another 4 years.

All rules remain the same; I can only include players based on their contributions with the team and I can have 2-4 players at each position. With that being said, the All-Time Pistons are down below.

&amp;#x200B;

**Head Coach: Chuck Daly (1983-92)**

Accolades w/Team: 467-271 Regular Season Record, 71-42 Playoff Record, 3 Finals Appearances, 2x NBA Champion

**Assistant Coach: Flip Saunders (2005-08)**

Accolades w/Team: 176-70 Regular Season Record, 30-21 Playoff Record

**Assistant Coach: Larry Brown (2003-05)**

Accolades w/Team: 108-56 Regular Season Record, 31-17 Playoff Record, 2 Finals Appearances, 1x NBA Champion

&amp;#x200B;

**PG1: Isiah Thomas (1981-94)**

Accolades w/Team: 3 Finals Appearances, 2x NBA Champion, 1x Finals MVP, 12x All-Star, 2x All-Star Game MVP, 3x All-NBA 1st Team, 2x All-NBA 2nd TeamStats: 19.2 PPG, 3.6 RPG, 9.3 APG, 1.9 SPG, 0.3 BPG

Drafted second overall in the 1981 NBA Draft by the Pistons, Isiah Thomas spent his entire 13-year career in the Motor City. As a rookie, Zeke came onto the scene and averaged 17 PPG, 7.8 APG, and 2.1 SPG and was even selected as an All-Star for the first of 12 All-Star selections. Thomas’s next five seasons after his rookie season would be his best as he averaged 21.4 PPG, 4 RPG, 10.7 APG, and 2.3 SPG during that span which included an All-NBA selection in each of those seasons. While Zeke didn’t post the same statistics during the next three seasons, he still made the All-Star team in each one, averaged 18.7 PPG, 8.7 APG, and 1.7 SPG, and helped lead the Pistons to the Finals in each of those three years. Thomas had his postseason moments in that span from 1988-90 like when he scored 25 points in the third quarter, a Finals record, during Game 6 of the 1988 NBA Finals as well as a Finals MVP performance in the 1990 NBA Finals when he averaged 27.6 PPG, 5.2 RPG, and 7 APG in five games against the Portland Trail Blazers. While an Achilles injury ended Isiah Thomas’s career during the 1993-94 season, he is still the all-time leader in points, assists, and steals in the history of the Detroit Pistons.

&amp;#x200B;

**PG2: Chauncey Billups (2002-08, 2013-14)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 1x NBA Champion, 1x Finals MVP, 4x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 2x All-NBA 3rd Team, 2x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 16.5 PPG, 3.2 RPG, 6.2 APG, 1 SPG, 0.2 BPG

After spending the first five years of his NBA career with four different teams, Chauncey Billups signed a six-year contract worth $35 million with the Pistons after averaging 22 PPG in the first round of the 2002 postseason with the Minnesota Timberwolves. While Billups had a solid first two seasons with the Pistons as he averaged 16.6 PPG, 3.6 RPG, and 4.8 APG during that span, he first came onto the scene during the 2004 NBA Finals as he helped the Pistons win the NBA championship over the favorite Lakers in five games, won the Finals MVP, and averaged 21 PPG, 3.2 RPG, and 5.2 APG in those five games while shooting 50.9% from the field. After helping lead the Pistons to the NBA Finals again in 2005, Billups made the All-Star team in each of the next three seasons as he averaged 17.5 PPG, 3.1 RPG, and 7.6 APG during that span, and had an All-NBA selection in two of those three seasons. However, the Pistons fell short of the NBA Finals in each of those three seasons, and after two games with the team in the 2008-09 season, Mr. Big Shot was traded to the Nuggets for Allen Iverson. Billups did return for the 2013-14 season as he averaged just 3.8 PPG in 19 games, but his big shots and accolades help him make this all-time team.

&amp;#x200B;

**PG3: Dave Bing (1966-75)**

Accolades w/Team: 6x All-Star, 1966-67 Rookie of the Year, 2x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 22.6 PPG, 4.2 RPG, 6.4 APG, 1.4 SPG, 0.3 BPG

Drafted second overall by the Detroit Pistons in the 1966 NBA Draft, Dave Bing spent his first nine seasons in the NBA with the franchise. Bing had a very good rookie year as he averaged 20 PPG, 4.5 RPG, and 4.1 APG which helped him win that year’s Rookie of the Year award. After that rookie season, Bing emerged as one of the league’s top point guards during the late 1960s and early 1970s as he averaged 24.4 PPG, 4.4 RPG, and 6.5 APG during a six-year span that lasted from 1967-73. During that span, Bing also made 4 All-Star appearances as well as 2 selections to the All-NBA 1st Team. After the 1972-73 season, Bing played his final two seasons in the Motor City as his stats went down to 18.9 PPG, 3.5 RPG, and 7.3 APG during that span. While he still made the All-Star team in each of those last two seasons, Bing was traded to the Washington Bullets in the 1975 offseason. At the time when Bing was traded, he was the all-time leader in points and assists for the Pistons.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG1: Joe Dumars (1985-99)**

Accolades w/Team: 3 Finals Appearances, 2x NBA Champion, 1x Finals MVP, 6x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 2x All-NBA 3rd Team, 4x All-Defensive 1st Team, 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 16.1 PPG, 2.2 RPG, 4.5 APG, 0.9 SPG, 0.1 BPG

Joe Dumars spent his entire 14-year playing career with the Detroit Pistons, including his first nine as the backcourt partner to Isiah Thomas. Dumars was a solid player in his first three seasons as he averaged 11.8 PPG and 4.6 APG during that span. However, his fourth season would be really good as he made the All-Defensive 1st Team and posted averages of 17.2 PPG and 5.7 APG. He even helped the Pistons win their first NBA championship during the 1989 postseason as he averaged 27.3 PPG, and 6 APG against the Lakers in four NBA Finals matches to help him win that year’s Finals MVP. Dumars would be a formidable guard during the next six seasons as he averaged 20.5 PPG, 2.2 RPG, and 4.7 APG during that span which included another NBA championship in 1990 as well as five All-Star selections and four All-Defensive selections. Dumars even added a three-point shot in his game for the 1992-93 season in addition to his exceptional defense as he made 112 three-pointers that season compared to 117 in his first seven. Dumars retired after the 1998-99 season as the Pistons’ leader in games played for the franchise and joined the team’s front office in 2000 and stayed there until 2014 as he helped the Pistons win another championship in 2004 as their GM.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG2: Richard Hamilton (2002-11)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 1x NBA Champion, 3x All-Star

Stats: 18.4 PPG, 3.4 RPG, 3.8 APG, 0.9 SPG, 0.2 BPG

After averaging 20 PPG in his final season with the Washington Wizards, Rip Hamilton was traded to the Detroit Pistons before the 2002-03 season in exchange for a package that included All-Star Jerry Stackhouse. During the mid-2000s, when the Pistons were mainly a defensive-oriented team, Hamilton was a solid defender who also led the team in scoring in each of his first eight seasons as a Detroit Piston, including their championship team in 2004. From 2002-10, Hamilton was a key player as he averaged 18.8 PPG, 3.5 RPG, and 3.9 APG while also making three All-Star teams during that span. While Hamilton wasn’t the most consistent three-point shooter for the Pistons, he still led the NBA in three-point percentage in the 2005-06 season by shooting 45.8% on 1.5 attempts per game from three, which is more than 10% more than his three-point percentage during his entire nine-year tenure with the Pistons (35.4%). After the 2010-11 season, when he averaged just 14.1 PPG, Hamilton was waived by the Pistons and signed by the Chicago Bulls.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG3: Jerry Stackhouse (1997-02)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star

Stats: 22.1 PPG, 3.7 RPG, 4.4 APG, 1.1 SPG, 0.5 BPG

Jerry Stackhouse spent his NBA career with eight different NBA teams, but he is most known for his four-and-a-half-year stint with the Detroit Pistons. Acquired from the 76ers during the 1997-98 season, Stackhouse averaged 15.2 PPG during his first one-and-a-half seasons with the team while coming off the bench. However, Stackhouse had an All-Star campaign the very next season as he averaged 23.6 PPG, playing alongside Grant Hill. Without Hill, who left via free agency for the Magic, Stackhouse had a huge 2000-01 season as he averaged 29.8 PPG, which was second in the NBA that season despite shooting 40.2% from the field. Stackhouse’s scoring reduced in the 2001-02 season as he averaged 21.4 PPG, but despite the Pistons winning their division, Stackhouse shot a worse percentage from the field and was traded to the Wizards after the 2001-02 season.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF1: Grant Hill (1994-00)**

Accolades w/Team: 5x All-Star, 1994-95 Rookie of the Year, 1x All-NBA 1st Team, 4x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 21.6 PPG, 7.9 RPG, 6.3 APG, 1.6 SPG, 0.6 BPG

After drafted third overall by the Detroit Pistons in the 1994 NBA Draft, after Isiah Thomas was forced to retire, Grant Hill was a really good player during his six-year stint in the Motor City. It starts with Hill’s rookie year, where he averaged 19.9 PPG, 6.4 RPG, 5 APG, and 1.8 SPG, made the All-Star team, and won the Rookie of the Year that season. Hill was an all-around star during his next four seasons, averaging 20.9 PPG, 8.5 RPG, 6.8 APG, and 1.6 SPG in that span in which he made the All-Star team three times (1999 had no All-Star game due to the lockout) and had an All-NBA selection in all four of those seasons. After the 1999 lockout season, Hill had the best season of his career the very next year as he averaged 25.8 PPG, 6.6 RPG, and 5.2 APG. However, Hill suffered an ankle injury just before the 2000 postseason and that ankle injury would get worse in that year’s postseason, and went to the Magic through a sign-and-trade deal, after the season, during the 2000 offseason in a deal that sent Ben Wallace to Detroit.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF2: George Yardley (1953-59)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 5x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 19.1 PPG, 9.2 RPG, 1.7 APG

The flamboyant George Yardley was one of the first great scorers during the history of the NBA. After averaging just 9 PPG in his rookie season, Yardley was a very good player over the next three seasons as he averaged 18.8 PPG and 10 RPG during this span in which he made the All-Star team in each of those seasons. However, Yardley had his best season in the 1957-58 season as, thanks to his excellent mid-range jumper, he averaged a league-leading 27.8 PPG as well as 10.7 RPG. Thanks to those 27.8 points he put up on average each night, Yardley became the first player in NBA history to score 2,000 points in a single season. While Yardley did average 20.8 PPG and 7.1 RPG during the 46 games he played with the Pistons next season, he broke his hand and was traded to the Syracuse Nationals during that season.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF3: Dave DeBusschere (1962-69)**

Accolades w/Team: 3x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-Defensive 1st Team

Stats: 16.1 PPG, 11.2 RPG, 2.6 APG

An eventual Hall of Fame forward known for his defense, Dave BeBusschere played six-and-a-half seasons in his hometown of Detroit after being drafted by the Pistons with a territorial selection of the 1962 NBA Draft. DeBusschere was solid in his rookie year as he averaged 12.7 PPG and 8.7 RPG. After playing in just 15 games during his second season, DeBusschere averaged 17.3 PPG, and 12 RPG during the next four-year span in which he made the All-Star team the last three years and also played the role as coach, in addition to playing, during the first three. After averaging 16.3 PPG and 12.2 RPG during the first 29 games of the 1968-69 season, he was traded to the Knicks during the season.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF1: Ben Wallace (2000-06, 2009-12)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 1x NBA Champion, 4x All-Star, 4x Defensive Player of the Year, 3x All-NBA 2nd Team, 2x All-NBA 3rd Team, 5x All-Defensive 1st Team

Stats: 6.6 PPG, 11.1 RPG, 1.5 APG, 1.4 SPG, 2.3 BPG

When Ben Wallace was acquired by the Detroit Pistons as compensation for Grant Hill went to the Magic, he was a little-known player who averaged just 6.3 RPG. In his first season in the Motor City, Big Ben’s scoring average didn’t go up too much as he averaged 6.4 PPG, but his rebounding numbers were incredible as he averaged 13.2 RPG, which was second in the NBA. The next five seasons would be big ones for Wallace as he averaged 8.2 PPG, 12.8 RPG, 1.6 SPG, and 2.8 BPG during that span in which he made five All-NBA selections, four All-Star selections, led the league in rebounding twice as well as blocks one time, and won Defensive Player of the Year four times. During that span, Wallace also helped the Pistons win the NBA championship in 2004 as he averaged 10.3 PPG, 14.3 RPG, 1.9 SPG, and 2.4 BPG during that postseason run. After the 2005-06 season, Wallace signed a lucrative contract with the Chicago Bulls, but he returned to Detroit in 2009, although he was not the same player after that.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF2: Dennis Rodman (1986-93)**

Accolades w/Team: 3 Finals Appearances, 2x NBA Champion, 2x All-Star, 2x Defensive Player of the Year, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team, 5x All-Defensive 1st Team

Stats: 8.8 PPG, 11.5 RPG, 1.3 APG, 0.7 SPG, 0.7 BPG

Like Ben Wallace, Dennis Rodman was not much of an offensive force while being a stallworth on the defensive end of the court. Drafted 27th overall by the Pistons in the 1986 NBA Draft, Rodman was a solid player in his rookie season, averaging 6.5 PPG and 4.3 RPG despite only playing in 15 MPG. Rodman’s next four seasons were an improvement from his rookie year as he was a key player on the Bad Boys Pistons and averaged 9.4 PPG and 10.1 RPG during that span in which he helped the team win two NBA championships and won two Defensive Player of the Year award. Although the Bad Boys Pistons started to dismantle during Rodman’s last two seasons in the Motor City, they were his best seasons as he averaged 8.8 PPG and 18.5 RPG in those two seasons. However, the collapse of the Pistons caused Rodman to become depressed, and he was traded to the Spurs before the 1993-94 season after demanding a trade.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF3: Bailey Howell (1959-64)**

Accolades w/Team: 4x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 21.1 PPG, 11.8 RPG, 2.3 APG

Drafted second overall by the Pistons in the 1959 NBA Draft, Bailey Howell was a really good power forward during his five-year stay in the Motor City. As a solid player in the post, Howell had a very good rookie year as he averaged 17.8 PPG and 10.5 RPG. After that rookie year, Howell was an All-Star for each of the next four seasons with the Pistons as he averaged 22 PPG and 12.2 RPG during that span. Although Howell had an incredible work ethic as well as excellent offensive rebounding, which would later get him into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame, he was traded to the Baltimore Bullets during the 1964 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**C1: Bob Lanier (1970-80)**

Accolades w/Team: 7x All-Star, 1974 All-Star Game MVP

Stats: 22.7 PPG, 11.8 RPG, 3.3 APG, 1.2 SPG, 2 BPG

Drafted first overall in the 1970 NBA Draft by the Detroit Pistons, Bob Lanier had a really good nine-and-a-half-year tenure with the franchise as their best scorer in the post. After averaging 15.6 PPG and 8.1 RPG in his rookie year, Lanier was exceptional in his next four seasons, with point guard Dave Bing, as he averaged 24 PPG, 13.6 RPG, 3.8 APG, and 2.7 BPG during that span and even made the All-Star team in each of those seasons. After Bing was traded to the Washington Bullets, Lanier played four more full seasons with Detroit as he averaged 23.7 PPG, 11.1 RPG, and 3.2 APG in a span in which he made the All-Star team an additional three times. In the 1979-80 season, Lanier averaged 21.7 PPG and 10.1 RPG in the first 37 games, but the Pistons were horrible that year, and he was traded to the Bucks during that season. When Lanier was traded, he was the all-time leader in points, rebounds, and blocks for the Pistons.

&amp;#x200B;

**C2: Bill Laimbeer (1982-93)**

Accolades w/Team: 3 Finals Appearances, 2x NBA Champion, 3x All-Star

Stats: 13.5 PPG, 10.1 RPG, 2.1 APG, 0.7 SPG, 0.9 BPG

During his 12-year tenure with the Detroit Pistons, Bill Laimbeer became one of the most hated NBA players in the entire history of the league because of his tendency to commit hard fouls against his opponents. Acquired by the Pistons during the 1981-82 season, Laimbeer averaged 12.8 PPG and 11.3 RPG during his first 30 games as a member of the team. Over the next five seasons, Laimbeer was a dominant force as he averaged 16.1 PPG and 12.3 RPG during that span in which he also made the All-Star team four times. With his hard-nosed, dirty defensive tactics, Laimbeer helped the franchise make the NBA Finals three times, winning the whole thing twice. When Laimbeer retired 11 games into the 1993-94 season, he finished as the all-time leading rebounder and fouler for the Pistons, franchise records he still holds to this day.

&amp;#x200B;

**C3: Larry Foust (1950-57)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 6x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 15 PPG, 10.9 RPG, 1.9 APG

Larry Foust was one of the best centers during the early days of the NBA. Foust made the All-Star team in each of his first six seasons with the Detroit Pistons as he averaged 15.3 PPG and 11.2 RPG during that span. Foust also helped lead the Pistons to the NBA Finals two times, in 1955 and 1956, and was the best center in the league for the 1954-55 season, after George Mikan retired, as he averaged 17 PPG, 10 RPG, and led the NBA in field-goal percentage at 48.7% on 11.7 attempts per game. After a down 1956-57 season where he averaged 12.4 PPG and 9.1 RPG, Foust was traded to the former Minneapolis Lakers during the 1957 offseason.

**Analysis**

* Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars form a dynamic duo in the starting backcourt. Both of them are very good playmakers and scorers who elevated their teammates as they helped the Pistons win their two championships in 1989 and 1990. Hill and Lanier were really good scorers and are benefited by a great playmaker like Isiah Thomas. In addition, none of those guys are bad defensively. In fact, they are all pretty good defensively based on what I read and 4x Defensive Player of the Year Ben Wallace elevates the starting lineup's defense by a lot despite not providing much offensively.
* Off the bench, Billups and Hamilton were another backcourt duo that played together and helped the team win an NBA championship in 2004. With Billups's playmaking ability as well as the shooting and defense from both players, there shouldn't be many issues when Dumars and Thomas are off the floor. Yardley was an excellent scorer, Laimbeer was a tenacious rebounder and hard-nosed defender, and Rodman was a very hard-nosed defensive player and elevates the defense of the second unit.
* Defensively, this team is stacked. Out of the team, the only weak link defensively was Yardley, but that shouldn't be much of an issue considering all nine of the other rotation guys were very good defenders at worst. Offensively, there are a lot of guys in both the first and second unit who can lead the team in scoring on any given night like Thomas, Dumars, Hill, Lanier, and Yardley, just to give some examples.

How good is he overall? 

How good is his defense? He got an all defensive nod last year so he must be doing something right, but what are some comparisons and just how good of a defender is he?

How good is he on offense, and does he have tons of room to improve or is he closer to his ceiling? How good of a playmaker is he? Can he eventually shoot the 3 consistently?

I am a huge Zach LaVine fan. I am a Timberwolves fan, and became a fan of his when he was on the Wolves. I was pissed the night when we traded Jimmy Butler, as I felt we gave up way too much, and that we were actually the ones robbed, not the ones doing the robbing, because Butler's age and where he was at in his career didn't fit our timeline with Towns and Wiggins (who looked extremely promising at the time), and that LaVine, Dunn, and whoever we drafted with the 7th pick (probably Lauri) fit our timeline and roster much better. I had little to no worry about Zach recovering from his ACL tear. His first year back, yes he looked a little rough and struggled with efficiency, but that was to be expected. And then this year came, and he was a monster. 24, 5, and 4, on extremely efficient 47/37/83 shooting splits, and got to the line 6 times a game, which was a career high for him. 

Now, here is my question. Ever since Devin Booker got into the league, he has been heralded as ""the next Kobe"" and the next big thing. But the main argument against Zach is that his game has yet to yield winning basketball, but here's the thing: the exact same thing can be said for Booker. In my opinion, if LaVine is putting up ""empty stats"" than so is Booker. I'll admit, Booker is a better playmaker, but Zach is a better athlete. Here's what concerns me: Booker is heralded as the better shooter and all that. But this year, he shot 47% (basically same as LaVine) and shot 86% from the free throw line on 7 attempts per game, so about right in line with Zach. From 3, he shot 33% on 6.5 attempts per game. LaVine again shot 37%, and on a high number of attempts as well, 5.1 per game. And you can say Booker didn't have talent around him, same can be said for LaVine. Booker had Ayton all year. LaVine went through most of the first half with no Lauri, and no Dunn, and Jabari Parker was probably the next best player next to him, and he didn't get Otto Porter until the trade deadline. They are both bad defenders I should note as well, though I give LaVine a slightly better chance to improve on that end. In my opinion, they are about equal players right now, both having a few strengths and weaknesses separate from each other. So why does Booker always get looked at as the ""franchise cornerstone"" and better player than Zach LaVine, who is a young stud and building block in his own right.

(I'm going to reference BetOnline for these takes because I think their odds pretty well reflect the opinions I've seen on these teams.)  Denver is at 10-1 to win the west and San Antonio is at 40-1.  It seems really strange that those odds would be so different considering that I actually believe San Antonio will be the better playoff team this year.  Why would they be expected to lose this series with Murray back?  I get that Denver has a more extensive young core, but the Spurs have a really good reputation with internal improvement and still have a fairly large young core themselves.  Denver still has to worry about the aging of Plumlee and Millsap, though I don't think those two quite equal the aging factor with Aldridge, Gay, Belinelli, and DeRozan for the Spurs.  Aldridge has been aging really well, though, and he's the main guy the Spurs can't afford to lose even if Gay has been really useful for them, too.  These odds seem to ignore how much of an impact Murray can have in the playoffs this year, imo.  

Comparing them to Portland who is 20-1 to win the west is also kind of interesting.  I think Nurkic is a strong case to be load-managed long-term.  He's now had surgeries on his left knee, tibia, and fibula, and I think he is a bit of a longshot to be healthy for the playoffs.  Looking at these two teams this past season and I again don't think it's unfair to wonder what might have happened if San Antonio would have met Portland in the second round with a healthy DeJounte Murray, and what that could mean for a potential playoff matchup this year.  More importantly is that these two teams are at 46 1/2 regular season wins and I think that's kind of absurd considering the fit and injury adjustments the Blazers have to make compared to the Spurs.  If Murray's recovery goes smoothly, the Spurs are a strong candidate to start the regular season very hot as they will have more continuity than most teams, especially the Blazers.",True,False,,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,63534,public,self,"Comparing the expectations surrounding Denver, San Antonio, and Portland and why I think they're a bit off.",0,1565911398,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cqhp0x/comparing_the_expectations_surrounding_denver_san/,,,,,,,,,,,,

I wanted to look at the best defenses in NBA history.  Initially I was only concerned with dynasties (pistons, spurs, knicks), but then I expanded to top 5 defenses in the regular season that advanced at least one round in the playoffs.  I only graphed the ""best"" ones.  These had at least a distance from the origin of 5, which is an arbitrary cutoff, but looking at some that were lower, it seemed like a decent place to start.  I know the graph might be hard to read since there are so many different teams and almost all of them have red or blue as their team color so I'll include shots of the raw data as well.  The way I determined the x and y axis was somewhat simple.  For the regular season I just measured the teams Drtg vs the league average Ortg.  So if a team's Drtg was 100 and the league average Ortg was 105, their RS coordinate was 5.  For the postseason I had to weigh it for different opponents.  So if they played a team that averaged 112 in the regular season but they held them to 110 for 7 games, that would be -2\*7=-14 and another team that averaged 110 that they held to 100 over 4 games, thats -10\*4=-40.  Then I averaged it so -14-40=-54/11 total games =-4.91 or 4.91 on the PS axis.

&amp;#x200B;

I included the round and GP in the data because as I was going through it, it was apparent that the biggest drop offs were in rounds 1 and 2, since a great defense can probably alter a middling offense better than an elite one.

&amp;#x200B;

A few things on the data, I can't guarantee this is all of the defenses that have an abs value of 5 as it was just me on bbref for hours and hours, but if it's not every single year it's really close.  I chose to not include non playoff teams as well as round 1 exits because of sample size for only 1 round and I wanted to see how the best defenses translated to the playoffs.

Only goes back to 1983 as there wasn't available data for all the playoff series before then

In 1985, the NBA moved to a lottery system to discourage tanking, weighting it in 1990 so the worst teams still had the best odds at the first overall pick.  After the Philadelphia 76ers, under the leadership of Sam Hinkie, decided to increase their odds at landing a high lottery pick by utilizing this stratagem over multiple seasons, the league stepped in and changed the lottery odds to discourage the practice.  It has been a hot topic in the NBA since Hinkie took over the 76ers, and there have been many ideas to solve the issue once and for all.

After thinking about the issue, I wanted to propose a solution I have mulled over and present it to be discussed as a potential solvent for tanking.  My solution is to take the last 4 teams that missed the playoffs plus the eight teams that lose in the first round and place them in an unweighted lottery for picks 1-12.  The top ten worst records would then receive selections 13-22 while the semifinalists, conference finalists, and NBA runner up and champion would receive picks 23-30 in order of playoff finish (similar to the NFL's sorting for picks).  I believe this would eliminate tanking and promote teams to push for playoff spots as this would increase the likelihood they end up with a ""lottery"" pick.  

Because the picks would be unweighted, and include playoff and non-playoff teams, there would be no reason to tank outside the playoffs.  It would allow for teams in the NBA's middle class to potentially receive a franchise altering player thus providing hope to teams in the now undesirable middle.  It would incentivize teams to play all 82 games and sign veterans that could help their teams win games thus giving us a better product throughout the entire season.  It would also punish teams that had inept front offices as they could no longer ""luck"" into a star player thus saving their franchise from repeated failed signings.

So if they played a team that averaged 112 in the regular season but they held them to 110 for 7 games, that would be -2\\*7=-14 and another team that averaged 110 that they held to 100 over 4 games, thats -10\\*4=-40.  Then I averaged it so -14-40=-54/11 total games =-4.91 or 4.91 on the PS axis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI included the round and GP in the data because as I was going through it, it was apparent that the biggest drop offs were in rounds 1 and 2, since a great defense can probably alter a middling offense better than an elite one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few things on the data, I can\'t guarantee this is all of the defenses that have an abs value of 5 as it was just me on bbref for hours and hours, but if it\'s not every single year it\'s really close.

I wanted to look at the best defenses in NBA history.  Initially I was only concerned with dynasties (pistons, spurs, knicks), but then I expanded to top 5 defenses in the regular season that advanced at least one round in the playoffs.  I only graphed the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; ones.  These had at least a distance from the origin of 5, which is an arbitrary cutoff, but looking at some that were lower, it seemed like a decent place to start.  I know the graph might be hard to read since there are so many different teams and almost all of them have red or blue as their team color so I&amp;#39;ll include shots of the raw data as well.  The way I determined the x and y axis was somewhat simple.  For the regular season I just measured the teams Drtg vs the league average Ortg.

Another solid voting showing, 52 reponses, but with much closer scores than yesterday. Before we get started on the recap:

**[ROUND 3 VOTING FORM HERE](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/VRLD3FG)**

Quick Refresher on the criteria that was used to make the teams and the seedings. 

****

* **Only Players Who Were Selected In the Lotto Era are Eligible**

* **So only players selected from 1985 on are eligible for this exercise. (See previous posts for more explanation as to why)**
  * Only 16 teams will be created, 1 team for each lotto pick and 2 additional teams representing picks 15-30 and the second round

* **Positions and Peak is Taken into Account**

  * Each player is assumed to be at their absolute peak of their powers

* **Teams are seeded by total cumulative Win Shares on the team** 

 * This isn't a perfect method, but it's pretty fair and did a pretty good job of positioning the best teams vs the worst teams. So for example the #1 overall seed is the #1 picks team (no surprise) with a cumulative WS total of  1,412.3 and their match up is the #12 picks team (again no surprise) with a total cumulative WS of 424. This way a team like the second round picks team doesn't have to go against the #1 picks team right away.

**RESULTS**

* **Left Side of Bracket**


- **[#1 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cgvtu5/xpost_rnba_all_time_draft_picks_team_1_selection/) (80.8%, 42 votes)** defeated the  [#13 Picks Team] (https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cm0dya/all_time_nba_draft_team_13_selections/) (19.2%, 10 votes)

 * This is about the beatdown that I was expecting in this matchup. The #13 picks team pulled off an upset over the Second Round Team, but the #1 picks are just too overwhelming. There really wasn't a conceivable way for the #13 picks to matchup up size wise, and they didn't have an answer for LeBron. Despite the flaws with the #1 team; lack of spacing, only 1 true wing player, too many bigs, this team has steamrolled the competition so far, but I'm not quite sure if this will continue with the next opponent...



- **[#9 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ckbxz5/all_time_nba_draft_team_9_selections/) (52%, 27 votes)** defeated the [#2 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ch96nt/all_time_draft_picks_team_2_selection/) (48%, 25 votes)

 * This was really fun to watch through yesterday and this morning, as the teams went back and forth. There was never a point that I saw that either team had more than a 4 vote lead over the other, this was a close as it comes. The #9 picks were a darkhorse candidate for me, they have a bevy of versatile wings who can shoot and defend and they have great depth their bigs. Dirk and T-Mac on the same team is a deadly combo that seems impossible to defeat. The #2 picks were a really good team, but struggled with balance (there's a lot of busts with the #2 selection). Ultimately I think the lack of wing defenders did this team in. Kidd and Payton are all-time great defensive guards, but even they would struggle at times with defending some of these larger wings. This result could easily be flipped and it would make perfect sense.  

****

* **Right Side of Bracket**

- [#5 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ciiu10/all_time_nba_draft_team_5_selections/) (48%, 25 votes) lost to the **[#15-30 First Round Picks Team] (https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cmrcfk/all_time_nba_draft_teams_best_of_the_rest_of_the/) (52%, 27 vote)**

 * In terms of where guys were taken this is the bigest upset, but it makes complete sense. Maybe I should have split this team up with picks 15-23 and 24-30, because the rest of the First Round team has incredible depth. The #5 picks were my favorite to win, I loved the combination of spacing and defense they had. Wade, Pippen, and Garnett are forces of nature defensively, but I think not having that extra elite wing defender was the difference when you go up against Kawhi and Giannis. Prime Wade could certainly guard bigger guys, but both Kawhi and Giannis are probably too big and strong for him to realistically guard the whole game. Not to mention the Picks 15-30 team can create a devastating defensive lineup that could have Kawhi, Giannis, and AK47 all playing at the same time, just suffocating penetration with their length and size. This team I think is the favorite to win the tournament with the combo of depth and elite talent that they have. 


- *(Only 51 responses)* **[#3 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/chnuk6/all_time_draft_picks_team_3_selection/) (64.7%, 33 votes)** defeats the [#4 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ci2vzi/all_time_draft_picks_team_4_selection/) (35.3%, 18 votes)

 * This margin of victory is kind of surprising to me, I'm really curious to hear why people think it is. The guard combos  (Penny, Billups, Harden, Beal, etc..) for the #3 picks was probably the deciding factor. The #4 picks had top tier talent (CP3 and Russ), but the fit was always a bit awkward. Looking at these teams the #3 picks are certainly a much more explosive team, I mean Melo off the bench is pretty insane. This is going to be a fascinating match-up with the Non-Lotto First team, I would expect that to be much closer.

**ROUND 3 MATCHUPS**

* **Left Side of Bracket**


- **[#1 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cgvtu5/xpost_rnba_all_time_draft_picks_team_1_selection/)** vsvs **[#9 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ckbxz5/all_time_nba_draft_team_9_selections/)**

 * This is the first real test for the #1 picks. So far they've been able to bully other teams with their size and get away with their lack of wing depth, but the #9 picks might prove to be their kryptonite. Thus far the combo of Shaq, Duncan, Robinson, Davis, Ewing etc.. have just been too big for teams, for the most part you don't have 3-4 talented bigs fall very far in the draft. This is not the case with the #9 picks. Yes Dirk and STAT aren't great defensively, but they can be paired with Noah, Oakley, Drummond, big physical players who can hold their own on the post against the behemoths that the #1 picks have. Also the wing depth of T-Mac, Iggy, Marion, Hayward, DeRozan is going to be really hard for the #1 picks to defend. The #9 picks can bench Kemba and still have enough ball handlers and shot creators where they don't have to be too concerned. LeBron can match-up with any of these wings, but then who else do the #1 picks have? Irving, Rose, AI are all subpar defenders, who lack the necessary size and could be abused in the post. I would imagine LeBron is shadowing T-Mac the entire game, he's the most dynamic offensive player of the bench. Iggy and Marion have limitations as shooters and creators, allowing the smaller guards to sag off some and rely on their quickness and rim protection behind them to pick up the slack. Marion and Iggy are perfect LeBron defenders, they can hound him all game long on defense allowing other guys to focus a bit more on offense. Dirk once again is the biggest problem for the #1 picks with the spacing he provides. Anthony Davis and Duncan are great Dirk defenders, but Dirk's spacing will take them away from protecting the rim, opening up driving lanes for the wings. This team is a matchup nightmare for the #1 picks. 

 * And still the #1 picks are going to be really hard to defeat. As great of defenders that the #9 wings are, the guards for the #1 picks are just way too fast. Rose, AI, and Kyrie will be able to get by anyone on that team, and if you play Kemba a lot then the #9 picks are forfeiting the biggest advantage. Even with all the size that the #9 picks have, the #1 picks can still use their size to their advantage. If the #9 picks go with the all wing + Dirk/STAT lineup the #1 picks can abuse both of them in the post with Shaq and Robinson. If the #9 picks win it's going to be because they are playing a min of 3 wings at a time, but really 4 is the ideal number. Anthony Davis and Duncan are perfect Dirk defenders, that throws different defensive looks on the big German. Blake is going to be key for the #1 picks, if can be able to be serviceable as a wing defender then that will create matchup problems on the other end, especially with Blake's shot creating ability. The ideal lineup for the #1 picks might be something like Kyrie (for spacing), LeBron, Blake, AD, Shaq/Duncan/Robinson. Even with the size of the #9 picks they're going to get eaten alive by Shaq, the big question will be is can Shaq survive in the PnR vs the #9 picks. I think that 2000 Shaq probably can, but it will be tough. Duncan, AD, and Robinson might be better equipped to handle this match-up. Finally the biggest advantage the #1 picks have is LeBron. Yes the #9 picks have capable wing defenders who can get physical with LeBron, but LeBron is probably the second or third greatest player of all time who has performed heroics with much less talent. He can easily swing the entire match-up.

* **Right Side of Bracket**

- **[#3 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/chnuk6/all_time_draft_picks_team_3_selection/)** vs **[Picks 15-30 First Round Picks](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cmrcfk/all_time_nba_draft_teams_best_of_the_rest_of_the/)**

 * I'm not sure where to start with this contest, these teams are so evenly matched. The greatest strength for the Non-Lotto First team is Kawhi and Giannis are a killer 1-2 punch, but the #3 picks might actually be able to put up a resistance. The #3 picks have the right combo of length and size to match-up with Kawhi and Giannis at all times. Grant Hill and Sean Elliot (and Penny to a degree) are perfect Kawhi defenders. They have the right length, size, and smarts to be able to really make Kawhi work for his points. Melo was never a great defender, but he's strong and was quick enough in his prime to be able to handle Giannis, he won't be able to stop him, Giannis isn't called the Greek Freak for nothing, but Melo is a stout defender who also knows that he has 3 capable rim protectors in Gasol, Embiid, and Horford to cover his bases. Billups, Hardaway, and even Deron Williams are going to be serious problems for Nash. They're a lot bigger than Nash is and should be able to play solid defense on him, and Nash is going to be exposed by them. The Non-Lotto firsts may want to look at Lowry playing more, or even Jimmy Butler and go with no true PG. 

 * The Non-Lotto firsts are lucky enough to have some great defenders to throw at Harden. Jimmy Butler and Joe Dumars are two smart and physical defenders who can make Harden uncomfortable. Giannis and Kawhi are both great Melo or Grant Hill defenders if the #3 picks go small, the defensive versatility of this team is going to be really hard to beat. The offensive firepower that the #3 picks is hard to match up against, but they're going to be tested. 




****

These match-ups are amazing, I can see every possible combo for the finals. We have 3 really strong teams with great depth, and 1 hyper talented team that has just physically and athletically over-matched everyone so far. I can't wait to see how the voting turns out. 

The plan is to have the Final Four voting be tomorrow, followed by the Finals voting on Thursday with the winner revealed on Friday along with the results of the 2K sim.

Accolades w/Team: 203-216 Regular Season Record, 8-9 Playoff Record

**Assistant Coach: Alvin Gentry (2015-)**

Accolades w/Team: 145-183 Regular Season Record, 5-4 Playoff Record

**Assistant Coach: Monty Williams (2010-15)**

Accolades w/Team: 173-221 Regular Season Record, 2-8 Playoff Record

&amp;#x200B;

**PG1: Chris Paul (2005-11)**

Accolades w/Team: 4x All-Star, 2005-06 Rookie of the Year, 1x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team, 1x All-Defensive 1st Team, 2x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 18.7 PPG, 4.6 RPG, 9.9 APG, 2.4 SPG, 0.1 BPG

Chris Paul is one of the two greatest players in New Orleans Pelicans history. Drafted fourth overall in the 2005 NBA Draft back when the franchise was known as the Hornets, Paul had a very good rookie season when he averaged 16.1 PPG, 5.1 RPG, 7.8 APG, and 2.2 SPG which helped him win the Rookie of the Year award. After improving in his second season, Paul became a superstar in his third season in the league, averaging 21.1 PPG, 4 RPG, 11.6 APG, and 2.7 SPG which helped place second in the MVP voting and be in the discussion for the best point guard in the NBA at that time. CP3 had another exceptional season the following year, averaging 22.8 PPG, 5.5 RPG, 11 APG, and 2.8 SPG although the Hornets were not as good as they were the previous year. Paul was still an All-Star in his last two seasons with the team, but he did experience a dropoff as he averaged 16.9 PPG, 4.1 RPG, 10.1 APG, and 2.3 SPG during that span. Although he was still an elite point guard, Paul was traded to the Clippers during the 2011 offseason, but Paul was one of the league’s superstars during his six-year stay in the Crescent City.

&amp;#x200B;

**PG2: Baron Davis (2002-05)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 20.2 PPG, 4 RPG, 7 APG, 2.1 SPG, 0.4 BPG

B-Diddy was with the Hornets for only a little more than two seasons, but he is still one of only four players in franchise history to make an All-NBA team. Baron Davis was solid in his first season in New Orleans as he averaged 17.1 PPG, 3.7 RPG, 6.4 APG, and 1.8 SPG in 50 games and helped the Hornets make the playoffs. The following season, with All-Star Jamal Mashburn out for most of the season, Davis had his best season with averages of 22.9 PPG, 4.3 RPG, 7.5 APG, and a league-leading 2.4 SPG which helped him make the All-NBA 3rd Team and the Hornets make the playoffs that season. However, Davis struggled with injuries during the following season, and the Hornets were losing, which caused him to get traded to the Warriors in February of that season.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG1: Jrue Holiday (2013-)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Defensive 1st Team, 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 17.4 PPG, 4.1 RPG, 6.9 APG, 1.5 SPG, 0.6 BPG

Jrue Holiday, right now, is one of the most underrated players in the NBA. Holiday, after being traded to the Pelicans in 2013, missed a lot of games in his first two seasons in the franchise due to injuries. However, Holiday has since improved in his last four seasons as he averaged 18.1 PPG, 4.1 RPG, 6.7 APG, and 1.5 SPG during that span, including the last two seasons as he averaged 20 PPG, 4.7 RPG, 6.8 APG, and 1.6 SPG. During those last two seasons, Holiday made an All-Defensive team and after the Anthony Davis trade, Holiday will lead the Pelicans this upcoming season with a young core that includes one of the most anticipated rookies in NBA history in Zion Williamson.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG2: David Wesley (2002-04)**

Stats: 15.2 PPG, 2.5 RPG, 3.3 APG, 1.3 SPG, 0.2 BPG

David Wesley, like Baron Davis, played in New Orleans for two-and-a-half-years but he was a very good player there. Wesley had his best season during the first season in the Crescent City as he averaged 16.7 PPG and shot a really good 42.4% from the three-point line while being paired with Davis in the backcourt and helping the Hornets reach the playoffs. Even though Wesley averaged around 14 PPG during the rest of his tenure in New Orleans, his efficiency went down, and he was traded to the Rockets during the 2004-05 season.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG3: Eric Gordon (2011-16)**

Stats: 15.3 PPG, 2.4 RPG, 3.3 APG, 1 SPG, 0.2 BPG

Even though Eric Gordon missed a total of 173 games due to injuries during his five-year tenure with the New Orleans Hornets/Pelicans, he was still solid when he was healthy. Traded to New Orleans from the Clippers, Gordon only played in 51 games during his first two seasons but he averaged 17.6 PPG during that span. Gordon’s knee injuries caused his performance to decline as he played in three more seasons with the Pelicans with averages of 14.7 PPG, but his three-point percentage improved from 31% in his first two seasons to almost 41% during his last three seasons. After the 2015-16 season, Gordon signed with the Rockets where he’d win Sixth Man of the Year during the following season with them.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF1: Jamal Mashburn (2002-04)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 21.5 PPG, 6.1 RPG, 5 APG, 1 SPG, 0.2 BPG

Like Baron Davis and David Wesley, Jamal Mashburn was on the Hornets roster when the team relocated to New Orleans. During the Hornets’ first season in New Orleans, Mashburn had a really good year as he averaged 21.6 PPG, 6.1 RPG, and 5.6 APG which helped the Hornets make the playoffs, and also helped Mashburn make his first All-Star team as well as the All-NBA 3rd Team. However, in the next season, Mashburn only played in 19 games due to knee injuries. Although he averaged 20.8 PPG during those few games, Mashburn’s knee injuries didn’t get better, and he eventually retired after missing the 2004-05 season.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF2: Peja Stojakovic (2006-10)**

Stats: 14.3 PPG, 4 RPG, 1.3 APG, 0.8 SPG, 0.1 BPG

After spending a rather uneventful 40 games with the Pacers due to a trade during the middle of the previous season, Peja Stojakovic signed with the New Orleans Hornets during the 2006 offseason. After playing in only 13 games during his first season with the team, the Serbian sharpshooter played pretty well the next season as he averaged 16.4 PPG and shot 44.1% from three-point land on 6.8 attempts per game. Although Stojakovic averaged just 13 PPG over the next two seasons, he is still the all-time leader in three-pointers in the history of that franchise.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF3: Tyreke Evans (2013-17)**

Stats: 14.8 PPG, 4.8 RPG, 5.6 APG, 1.2 SPG, 0.3 BPG

Tyreke Evans was acquired by the Pelicans in the 2013 offseason via trade with the Sacramento Kings. During his first season with the team, Evans came off the bench for a majority of the 72 games he played in and averaged 14.5 PPG, 4.7 RPG, and 5 APG. Reke got a starting role in his second season with the Pelicans and was solid all-around as he averaged 16.6 PPG, 5.3 RPG, and 6.6 APG and helped the team make the playoffs. However, Tyreke only played in 51 games over the next season-and-a-half, and he was traded back to the Kings during the 2017 trade deadline in a deal that sent DeMarcus Cousins to New Orleans.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF1: David West (2003-11)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star

Stats: 16.4 PPG, 7.3 RPG, 2 APG, 0.7 SPG, 0.8 BPG

Drafted by the New Orleans Hornets in the stacked 2003 NBA Draft, David West played eight seasons for that franchise. West didn’t get much playing time in his first two seasons as he averaged just 4.5 PPG on 14.7 MPG. However, West broke out in his third season with the team as he averaged 17.1 PPG, and 7.4 RPG which helped him finish second in voting for that year’s Most Improved Player. West continued to be a really good player over his next five seasons with the team as he averaged 19.6 PPG, 8.1 RPG, and 2.4 APG during that span which included two All-Star selections. Even with his solid rebounding and very good mid-range jumper, the Hornets either lost in the first round or missed the playoffs during his last three seasons with the team, and he signed with the Pacers during the 2011 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF2: P.J. Brown (2002-06)**

Stats: 10.3 PPG, 8.5 RPG, 1.8 APG, 0.8 SPG, 0.8 BPG

While P.J. Brown didn’t put up a lot of points offensively, he was a very good rebounder and defender during his four-year stint in the Crescent City. During his first three seasons with the Hornets, Brown averaged 10.6 PPG, 8.8 RPG, and 1.9 APG during that span in which he helped the team to the playoffs those first two years. Brown’s production dwindled during his final season with the team as he averaged just 9 PPG and 7.3 RPG before being traded to the Bulls during the 2006 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF3: Ryan Anderson (2012-16)**

Stats: 16.1 PPG, 5.9 RPG, 1.1 APG, 0.5 SPG, 0.4 BPG

After winning the league’s Most Improved Player award in Orlando the previous season, Ryan Anderson signed with the New Orleans Hornets during the 2012 offseason. The 6’10” sharpshooter came off the bench in a majority of the games he played with the Hornets/Pelicans, but he averaged 16.1 PPG, 5.9 RPG, and 1.1 APG and even shoot 37.1% from three-point range on 6.3 attempts per game. After his best season in the Crescent City where he averaged 17 PPG and 6 RPG, Anderson signed with the Houston Rockets during the 2016 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**C1: Anthony Davis (2012-19)**

Accolades w/Team: 6x All-Star, 2017 All-Star Game MVP, 3x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-Defensive 1st Team, 2x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 23.7 PPG, 10.5 RPG, 2.1 APG, 1.4 SPG, 2.4 BPG

As the first overall draft pick of the 2012 NBA Draft, Anthony Davis was spectacular during his seven-year stay in the Crescent City. While Davis did average 13.5 PPG and 8.2 RPG in his rookie season, “The Brow” had a huge sophomore season as he averaged 20.8 PPG, 10 RPG, and a league-leading 2.8 BPG which helped him make the All-Star team for the first time. Davis remained the face of the franchise for the next five years as he dominated, averaging 26.3 PPG, 11.1 RPG, 2.4 APG, and 2.4 BPG during that span in which he made the All-Star team each year, earned 3 All-NBA 1st Team and All-Defensive selections each, led the NBA in blocks per game an additional two times, and placed in the Top 5 in the MVP voting two times. However, despite Davis being one of the NBA’s biggest stars, the Pelicans only made the playoffs twice during his seven-year tenure with the team, and he was traded to the Lakers after demanding a trade during the middle of last season.

&amp;#x200B;

**C2: DeMarcus Cousins (2017-18)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star

Stats: 25 PPG, 12.7 RPG, 5 APG, 1.6 SPG, 1.5 BPG

When the Pelicans acquired DeMarcus Cousins, he was a 3x All-Star with the Sacramento Kings. Cousins played 17 games after the trade deadline during the 2016-17 season for the Pelicans and averaged 24.4 PPG, 12.4 RPG, 3.9 APG, 1.5 SPG, and 1.1 BPG. Cousins did really well in the first 48 games of the next season as he averaged 25.2 PPG, 12.9 RPG, 5.4 APG, 1.6 SPG, and 1.6 BPG which helped him make the All-Star team for the fourth time. However, Cousins tore his Achilles tendon late in a game against the Houston Rockets and his 2017-18 season was over like that. After that season, Cousins was a free agent, and the Pelicans offered him less than what he felt like he deserved. Thus, he decided to sign with the Warriors for the mid-level exception during the 2018 offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

**C3: Jamaal Magloire (2002-05)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star

Stats: 11.9 PPG, 9.5 RPG, 1.1 APG, 0.5 SPG, 1.3 BPG

Jamaal Magloire is one of the five players on this all-time team that moved with the original Charlotte Hornets to New Orleans during the 2002 offseason. After a solid first season in New Orleans where he averaged 10.3 PPG and 8.8 RPG, Magloire made the All-Star team the very next season as he averaged 13.6 PPG and 10.3 RPG. However, Magloire’s third season in the Crescent City was hampered by injuries. He averaged 14.1 PPG and 9 RPG in the first 11 games of the season before a finger injury kept him out of all but 12 of the remaining games of that season. After that season, Magloire was traded to the Bucks during the 2005 offseason, but he’s still one of seven All-Stars for the franchise.

&amp;#x200B;

**C4: Tyson Chandler (2006-09)**

Stats: 10.2 PPG, 11.3 RPG, 0.9 APG, 0.5 SPG, 1.4 BPG

Although Tyson Chandler averaged 9.4 RPG during his last two seasons with the Bulls, he was still a disappointment there considering he was the second overall pick in the 2001 NBA Draft, and he was traded to the New Orleans Hornets during the 2006 offseason. During his first season with the Hornets, Chandler averaged only 9.5 PPG, but he averaged 12.4 RPG which was second in the league in that category. The following season, Chandler had his best season as a pro with averages of 11.8 PPG, and 11.7 RPG which helped the Hornets get the second seed that year. However, Chandler’s next season was marred by disappointment and injuries as he averaged 8.8 PPG and 8.7 RPG in just 45 games, and he was traded to the Charlotte Bobcats after that season.

**Analysis**

* Chris Paul has a really good offensive talent around him. As a playmaking point guard that can also score, Paul can shoot or drive to the basket or pass to solid three-pointers in Jrue Holiday and Jamal Mashburn, kick to David West for a mid-range shot, or pass it to Anthony Davis who can score inside or with a jumpshot whether that be a mid-range or a three-pointer. I should also mention that the defense is pretty good as CP3, AD, and Jrue all made at least one All-Defensive team with the franchise.
* The bench is solid. B-Diddy is the backup point guard and a solid playmaker. He has shooters like David Wesley and Peja Stojakovic as well as DeMarcus Cousins who is a force inside and is also a solid three-point shooters. P.J. Brown isn't going to do much offensively, but he is pretty good defensively.

**[ROUND 2 VOTING FORM HERE](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Y3F9DXX)**

Quick Refresher on the criteria that was used to make the teams and the seedings. 

****

* **Only Players Who Were Selected In the Lotto Era are Eligible**

* **So only players selected from 1985 on are eligible for this exercise. (See previous posts for more explanation as to why)**
  * Only 16 teams will be created, 1 team for each lotto pick and 2 additional teams representing picks 15-30 and the second round

* **Positions and Peak is Taken into Account**

  * Each player is assumed to be at their absolute peak of their powers

* **Teams are seeded by total cumulative Win Shares on the team** 

 * This isn't a perfect method, but it's pretty fair and did a pretty good job of positioning the best teams vs the worst teams. So for example the #1 overall seed is the #1 picks team (no surprise) with a cumulative WS total of  1,412.3 and their match up is the #12 picks team (again no surprise) with a total cumulative WS of 424. This way a team like the second round picks team doesn't have to go against the #1 picks team right away.

**RESULTS**

* **Left Side of Bracket**


- **[#1 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cgvtu5/xpost_rnba_all_time_draft_picks_team_1_selection/) (96.5%, 55 votes)** defeated the  [#12 Picks Team] (https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/clkrw8/all_time_nba_draft_team_12_selections/) (3.5%, 2 votes)

 * Honestly only having 2 troll votes is pretty good, or there are 2 people who, despite never watching basketball, decided to vote in this poll and picked the plucky underdog. I'm only surprised that it wasn't 100%

- [Second Round Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cn5yyg/all_time_nba_draft_team_second_round_picks/) (47.4%, 27 votes) lost to the **[#13 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cm0dya/all_time_nba_draft_team_13_selections/) (52.6%, 30 votes)**

 * First upset of the tournament, although the teams were pretty evenly matched I'm still surprised by the outcome. Sure the #13 picks have Kobe and Malone, but I thought the depth and versatility of the second round picks would carry them to the second round. I will say from a narrative standpoint this might be better, Kobe vs LeBron, Kobe vs Shaq, really it's going to be Kobe vs everyone (don't think he would want it any other way though)

    * Still I'm not sure how the #13 picks made it through. Rodman and Draymond, not to mention Gasol, are pretty great guys to throw at Malone to stifle him. It seems like the lack of perimeter defense, which was pointed out in the post, was the reason for the Second Round Picks defeat. I can see a game where Kobe, Booker, Mitchell all go off, but how iso heavy would that offense be and would it be able to score consistently against a very good defensive team? Curious about people's thoughts below.

- **[#9 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ckbxz5/all_time_nba_draft_team_9_selections/) (98.3%, 56 votes)** defeated the [#8 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cjvz66/all_time_nba_draft_team_8_selections/) (1.7%, 1 vote)
 * So maybe there is really just 1 troll vote and the other vote for the #12 picks team is just a massive Mookie Blaylock fan. 

- **[#2 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ch96nt/all_time_draft_picks_team_2_selection/) (79%, 45 votes)** defeated the [#7 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cjea5h/all_time_nba_draft_team_7_selections/) (21%, 12 votes)
 * Tough break for the #7 picks team, despite Steph's greatness they just didn't have the horses to win. I thought it might be a bit closer, but the margin of defeat makes perfect sense

* **Right Side of Bracket**

- **[#5 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ciiu10/all_time_nba_draft_team_5_selections/) (98.3%, 56 votes)** defeated the [#14 Picks Team] (https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cmb7it/all_time_nba_draft_teams_14_selections/) (1.7%, 1 vote)

 * Starting to think that the 1 non troll vote might be Mookie Blaylock, or could just be a huge Muggsy Bogues fan. Maybe Nick Collison? 

- **[Picks 15-30, First Round](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cmrcfk/all_time_nba_draft_teams_best_of_the_rest_of_the/) (98.3%, 56 votes)** defeats the  [#10 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ckpe58/all_time_nba_draft_teams_10_selections/) (1.7%, 1 vote)

 * I'm really struggling figuring out the other vote for the #12 picks team, maybe this is just next level trolling.

- **[#3 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/chnuk6/all_time_draft_picks_team_3_selection/) (89.5%, 51 votes)** defeats the [#11 Picks Team](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cl4lfo/all_time_nba_draft_team_11_selections/) (10.5%, 6 votes)

 * Not unexpected by the outcome, maybe a bit by the margin, but it's hard to argue given how good the #3 team is.

- **[#4 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ci2vzi/all_time_draft_picks_team_4_selection/) (89.5%, 51 votes)**  defeats [#6 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/civr4c/nba_all_time_draft_team_6_selections/) (10.5%, 6 votes)

 * Surprised it was this close, but Blazers fans are rabid. Not much to analyze here.

**ROUND 2 MATCHUPS**

* **Left Side of Bracket**


- **[#1 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cgvtu5/xpost_rnba_all_time_draft_picks_team_1_selection/)** vsvs **[#13 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cm0dya/all_time_nba_draft_team_13_selections/)**

 * This is a really fascinating match-up, the #1 overall seed in the tournament vs the only upset thus far. Kobe and Malone proved to be a dynamic 1-2 punch, and the amount of guard and wing depth on the team is not to be understated. With that said who is guarding Shaq, Robinson, Ewing, Duncan? Malone was a good defender, but he's not a rim protector. Dale Davis is probably the best interior defender on the #13 picks team and he has some experience ""guarding"" Shaq who only averaged 38/17 on 61% shooting in the 2000 NBA Finals (that is a fucking absurd statline). The #13 picks have some capable defenders to throw at LeBron, but it's LeBron (there is a fun debate about which version of prime LeBron to pick, I personally think it's the '13 Heatles LeBron). The only way the #13 picks win is if their guards just go off, which they very well could. There isn't a good guard defender on the #1 picks team, but I would imagine LeBron would check Kobe in crunch time which was always the NBA's Finals dream. 



- **[#2 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ch96nt/all_time_draft_picks_team_2_selection/)** vs **[#9 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ckbxz5/all_time_nba_draft_team_9_selections/)**

 * I would honestly pay money to see this game actually played out. I feel bad for Kemba who is going to be hounded by Kidd and Payton, but the wing versatility for the #9 team does present some challenges. I'm guessing Durant and Payton would take turns guard T-Mac (good luck with that). Durant's length gives him a leg up, even though Payton was a maniac who legitimately thought (and almost could) guard anyone. The #9 squad can role out their all wings lineup of Iggy, Marion, T-Mac, Hayward and whatever big they want and cause some serious fits for the #2 picks team. Kidd and Payton can both guard bigger guys, any they are quick enough to switch everything, but these wings are going to be really challenging to contain. #9 can throw several defenders at Durant to make him uncomfortable, Marion and Iggy are probably two of the best Durant defenders in the tourney and even T-Mac or Hayward can guard Durant effectively to a degree that anyone can.

 * LMA is going to have a hard time with Dirk, Durant and Zo might be better options, but once again good fucking luck. I like that the #9 team can play big, if you put Zo on Dirk then LMA is going to get roasted by Stoudemire. The defensive bigs off the bench, Noah and Oak, are perfect guys to matchup against the bigs on the #2 picks team. This is going to come down to the wire and boil down to can Payton and Kidd guard the bevy of big wings on the #9 squad (I think they can) and can the wings on the #9 squad just throw bodies at Durant and tire him out (I also think they can). I honestly don't know who wins, but I would love to see it.

* **Right Side of Bracket**

- **[#5 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ciiu10/all_time_nba_draft_team_5_selections/)** vs **[Picks 15-30, First Round](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cmrcfk/all_time_nba_draft_teams_best_of_the_rest_of_the/)**

 * Another fantastic match-up between two really dynamic teams that is essentially a coin flip. The Non-Lotto First Round team is going to be a real tough out with Kawhi and Giannis on the same team, but I think this #5 picks team might be able to contain them. Pippen and Kawhi is a wash, yes Kawhi is a better scorer than Scottie, but Pippen is a much better distributor. I imagine Pippen will guard Kawhi and Kawhi probably picks up Carter or Wade. I'm not sure who guards Giannis, but I think Garnett might be a perfect Giannis defender for spells. Garnett's combination of foot speed, defensive positioning, intelligence, and size can give Giannis fits. Steve Smith off the bench is probably too small to effectively guard Giannis and I don't love the idea of Juwan Howard. Maybe Pippen and Garnett take Giannis duty and Wade goes head to head with Kawhi. Kawhi has the size advantage, but prime Wade is a really good defender who plays a lot bigger than his size. 

    *  Rubio is a good Nash foil, you wouldn't want Wade or Allen to be on him consistently. This game will come down to who controls the pace. The Non-Lotto First time is going to want to run non-stop, which the #5 picks team can probably keep up with them, but if the #5 picks can turn it into a halfcourt game then I think their combo of size and athleticism on offense and defense will be really hard to overcome.


- **[#4 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ci2vzi/all_time_draft_picks_team_4_selection/)**  vs **[#3 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/chnuk6/all_time_draft_picks_team_3_selection/)**

 *  I honestly can't figure out who will win this game.  CP3 and Russ are a flawed, but hyper-talented backcourt who I don't know if they can coexist. The #3 picks have so many guards combos they can play with, Penny and Billups would be excellent defensive foils for Russ and CP3, while Harden presents a match-up nightmare for both players. I think this will be won at the wings with how well Hill and Melo play. Hill can lock-down Glen Rice or Odom, or Mashburn or Jamison, prime Grant Hill was a defensive nightmare. Both of these teams are able to counter each other, but I think Melo is going to be a real problem for the #4 picks. Bosh is a great defender, but he's going to be cooked if he guards Melo, Odom might be the better fit, and he had success guarding Melo. A lineup by the #3 picks of Harden, Beal, Hill, Melo and a big would be really hard for the #4 squad to match-up against. This should be a really close contest and I'm really excited to see how it plays out. 

****

The first round proved to be largely non-competitive, which I expected, but this second round should be really interesting. We have 3 match-ups that are essentially coin flips in my mind. 

As far as the 2K sim by /u/FudgeCheese12 I'm thinking of letting the voting play out (final round results would be done by Friday) and then comparing that to the sim to not influence the voting, but I'm probably overthinking it. 

The plan is to have the Final Four voting be tomorrow, followed by the Finals voting on Thursday with the winner revealed on Friday along with the results of the 2K sim.

**When we discuss who is the GOAT; Michael Jordan is easily the most sought out and popular answer. His finals record, scoring attributes, vicious dunks are things that are commonly brought up but rarely do we see KAJ, Russell or Wilt thrown in the mix. (*I'm not saying they are better or they deserve the title just an observation*)**

* MJ emerged when basketball was just booming. News outlets, papers, and magazines were covering games like never before. TV's picked up in popularity like crazy in the 60's as people became obsessed with space travel, Beatles on the Ed Sullivan Show and nighttime broadcasts.

* The 70s-90s is when cable started becoming popular and MJ had ""access"" to SportsCenter or George Michael Sports Machine. None of the previous players had this kind of exposure and marketing that MJ was about to garner. 

* He was the first athlete to have a shoe named after him and also the first to have his shoes banned in the NBA. Nike was merging at the same time and started promoting Jordan like any athlete before. He was branded different to Magic or Bird. He had more swagger, allure, ""aura"" to him. 

* This actually got to the point where players were getting annoyed by how much attention he was receiving. Jordan finished with ROY but was knocked out in the first round. 

* MJ continued to garner national attention but failed to go deep in the playoffs although he was playing phenomenal. This began to cause uneasiness as people were getting restless for MJ to win his first championship but the narrative took a change =&gt; Pistons. 

* The Detroit Pistons were aggressive, physical and played hard. Their image took a turn when some of the team members made comments about MJ and Isiah backed his team up. His comments were blown up and they became the Bad Boys. ESPN 30 for 30 does a great job covering this. 

* The media now had a ""villain"" in Pistons and america's favorite BB star in MJ. It's easy to see how MJ's amazing performances along with the dislike for Pistons created the perfect environment to make Jordan look like a god. 

* The media, Nike, and marketing teams did everything to highlight his performances and they did it. He was the most famous person at the time and hailed as basketball god.  His athletic leaping ability, slam dunk contests, commercials and advertisements along with Space Jam mythologized him. 

##**Although MJ is one of the best basketball players and arguably the best I think the marketing by Nike, the media coverage, and the rise of popularity in Basketball across the world is a huge reason why MJ's legacy as the GOAT is so secure.**##

&amp;#x200B;

**Head Coach: Paul Silas (1999-02, 2010-12)**

Accolades w/Team: 193-208 Regular Season Record, 11-12 Playoff Record

**Assistant Coach: Allan Bristow (1991-96)**

Accolades w/Team: 207-203 Regular Season Record, 5-8 Playoff Record

**Assistant Coach: Steve Clifford (2013-18)**

Accolades w/Team: 196-214 Regular Season Record, 3-8 Playoff Record

&amp;#x200B;

**PG1: Kemba Walker (2011-19)**

Accolades w/Team: 3x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 19.8 PPG, 3.8 RPG, 5.5 APG, 1.3 SPG, 0.4 BPG

After leading UConn to a national championship and winning the Most Outstanding Player in the Final Four in the 2011 NCAA Tournament, Kemba Walker was drafted ninth overall by the then-Charlotte Bobcats in the 2011 NBA Draft. Walker improved his statistics, for the most part, in each of his first five seasons in Charlotte from 12.1 PPG in his rookie season to 20.9 PPG in his fifth season. However, Walker became an All-Star for the first time during the 2016-17 season as he averaged 23.2 PPG, 3.9 RPG, and 5.5 APG. After Walker had another All-Star season in the 2017-18 season with averages of 22.1 PPG, Kardiac Kemba had his best season last year as he averaged 25.6 PPG, 4.4 RPG, and 5.9 APG and had his first All-NBA selection as well. However, the Hornets missed the playoffs in the last three seasons, and Walker left Charlotte as their all-time leading scorer to join the Boston Celtics in free agency a month ago.

&amp;#x200B;

**PG2: Baron Davis (1999-02)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star

Stats: 12.6 PPG, 3.7 RPG, 6.5 APG, 1.8 SPG, 0.4 BPG

Drafted third overall in the 1999 NBA Draft by the Hornets, Baron Davis spent the first three years of his NBA career in the Queen City. Davis went from averaging 5.9 PPG on 19.6 MPG as a rookie to averaging 13.8 PPG, 5 RPG, 7.3 APG, and 2.1 SPG in his second season with the team. B-Diddy had an All-Star campaign in his third season with the Hornets as he averaged 18.1 PPG, 4.3 RPG, 8.5 APG, and 2.1 SPG. His postseason performance in 2002 was even better than his regular season as he averaged 22.6 PPG, 7 RPG, 7.9 APG, and 3.6 SPG despite shooting a below-average 37.8% from the field. However, the Hornets left Charlotte in 2002 for New Orleans, and Baron Davis went with them to the Big Easy, the first of three players on this all-time team that relocated with the first Hornets franchise to New Orleans.

&amp;#x200B;

**PG3: Muggsy Bogues (1988-97)**

Stats: 8.8 PPG, 2.9 RPG, 8.8 APG, 1.7 SPG

An extremely undersized point guard at 5’3”, Muggsy Bogues had a very solid nine-year tenure with the Hornets. After drafted in the expansion draft, Bogues had an okay first year with the team, averaging just 5.4 PPG and 7.8 APG. However, Bogues improved and remained a consistent point guard from 1989 to [this moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_6wunmLn5M) with the future owner of the Hornets in the 1995 postseason as he averaged 9.5 PPG, 3.2 RPG, 9.3 APG, and 1.8 SPG including two seasons where he averaged at least 10 APG during that span. Bogues was never the same player after 1995 and was traded to the Warriors at the start of the 1997-98 season.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG1: Eddie Jones (1999-00)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team, 2x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 19.2 PPG, 4.5 RPG, 4.2 APG, 2.8 SPG, 0.8 BPG

Eddie Jones was a two-time All-Star with the Lakers when he was acquired by the Hornets during the 1999 lockout season. In 30 games with the Hornets in 1999, Jones averaged 17 PPG, 3.9 RPG, 4.2 APG, and 3 SPG. Although the Hornets went 19-11 in the 30 games that Jones played in, the Hornets were unable to make the playoffs even though he made the All-Defensive 2nd Team. Jones had an even better 1999-00 season with the team as he averaged 20.1 PPG, 4.8 RPG, 4.2 APG, and a league-leading 2.7 SPG, made the All-Star team and All-NBA 3rd Team, and helped the Hornets return to the playoffs. The Hornets lost in the first round of the playoffs and Jones went to Miami during the 2000 off-season.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG2: Dell Curry (1988-98)**

Accolades w/Team: 1993-94 Sixth Man of the Year

Stats: 14 PPG, 2.9 RPG, 2 APG, 1.1 SPG, 0.3 BPG

I know Dell Curry did much more for the Hornets than Eddie Jones did but I had to make Dell come off the bench considering he started in only 77 out of the franchise-leading 701 games he played for the franchise. After being drafted in the expansion draft by the Hornets in 1988, Curry had an okay first season, averaging 11.9 PPG but he had a much better year in his second season with the team as he averaged 16 PPG. He had a down season the year after that but he remained consistent during the next six seasons as he averaged 15.5 PPG, 3.5 RPG, and 2.3 APG over that span. After averaging 9.4 PPG in the final season with the Hornets, he signed with the Bucks before the 1998-99 season. Dell is still involved in the NBA after his retirement as he works as a color commentator with the Hornets and has two sons in the NBA, including two-time MVP and the greatest three-point shooter of all-time in Stephen Curry.

&amp;#x200B;

**SG3: Kendall Gill (1990-93, 1995-96)**

Stats: 15.6 PPG, 4.5 RPG, 4.2 APG, 1.5 SPG, 0.5 BPG

Drafted fifth overall in the 1990 NBA Draft, Kendall Gill was a solid player for the three-and-a-half seasons he played for the Hornets. After averaging 11 PPG in his rookie campaign, Gill had a really good sophomore season where he averaged 20.5 PPG, 5.1 RPG, 4.2 APG, and 1.9 SPG. Gill dropped a bit in his third season, and he was traded to the Supersonics before the 1993-94 season. He returned to the Hornets at the start of the 1995-96 season where he averaged 12.9 PPG, 5.3 RPG, and 6.3 APG in 36 games before being traded to the Nets in a deal that sent Kenny Anderson to Charlotte.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF1: Glen Rice (1995-98)**

Accolades w/Team: 3x All-Star, 1997 All-Star Game MVP, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 23.5 PPG, 4.4 RPG, 2.4 APG, 1 SPG, 0.3 BPG

The Hornets acquired sharpshooter Glen Rice in the 1995 off-season after they had to trade Alonzo Mourning because of his beef with fellow star Larry Johnson. After making the All-Star team for the first time in the 1995-96 season when he averaged 21.6 PPG, Rice had a huge 1996-97 season as he averaged 26.8 PPG, 4 RPG, 2 APG, won All-Star Game MVP, made the All-NBA 2nd Team, and even led the league in three-point percentage at 47% on 5.6 attempts per game. He had another All-Star campaign in the 1997-98 season when he averaged 22.3 PPG, but he missed the beginning of the following season, and he was traded to the Lakers during the middle of next season for a package that included Eddie Jones.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF2: Gerald Wallace (2004-11)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star, 1x All-Defensive 1st Team

Stats: 16.4 PPG, 7.5 RPG, 2.4 APG, 1.8 SPG, 1.2 BPG

Although Gerald Wallace averaged only 3.4 PPG on 9.7 MPG in his three seasons in Sacramento, the then-expansion Charlotte Bobcats took the chance on him and picked him up in the expansion draft in 2004. After averaging 11.1 PPG in his first season in the Queen City, Wallace improved even more in his second season with the team as he averaged 15.2 PPG, 7.5 RPG, and a league-leading 2.5 SPG. Even though the Bobcats were losing, Wallace was still pretty good as he averaged 18 PPG, 7 RPG, 2.9 APG, and 1.9 SPG over the next three seasons. However, Wallace had a huge season in the 2009-10 season with averages of 18.2 PPG, 10 RPG, and 1.5 SPG, made the All-Star team as well as the All-Defensive 1st Team and even helped the Bobcats reach the playoffs for the first time. Unfortunately, the Bobcats returned to their losing ways the very next season, and he was traded in the middle of that season to the Portland Trail Blazers.

&amp;#x200B;

**SF3: Jamal Mashburn (2000-02)**

Stats: 20.6 PPG, 7.1 RPG, 5 APG, 1.1 SPG, 0.2 BPG

When the Hornets traded Eddie Jones in a sign-and-trade deal to the Miami Heat in 2000, they got three-point shooter and scorer Jamal Mashburn in return. Although he only played in a season and a half in Charlotte, Mashburn was still very good, especially in his first season when he averaged 20.1 PPG, 7.6 RPG, and 5.4 APG and helped the Hornets reach the playoffs. Mashburn played even better in that 2001 postseason as he averaged 24.9 PPG, 6.2 RPG, and 5.7 APG in 10 postseason games. While Mashburn averaged 21.5 PPG, 6.1 RPG, and 4.3 APG the following year, he got injured and only played in 40 games which made him play only ten minutes in the 2002 postseason. After that season, the Hornets moved to New Orleans, and Mashburn joined the team in the Crescent City for the 2002-03 season.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF1: Larry Johnson (1991-96)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star, 1991-92 Rookie of the Year, 1x All-NBA 2nd TeamStats: 19.6 PPG, 9.2 RPG, 4.1 APG, 0.8 SPG, 0.4 BPG

When Larry Johnson was drafted first overall in the 1991 NBA Draft, he was expected to be the next big superstar. Although he fell short of those expectations, he is still one of, if not the greatest player in Hornets history. He had an exceptional rookie season where he averaged 19.2 PPG, 11 RPG, and 3.6 APG which helped him win the Rookie of the Year award. Johnson followed that rookie campaign with an even better sophomore campaign as he averaged 22.1 PPG, 10.5 RPG, and 4.3 APG, made the All-Star team as well as the All-NBA 2nd Team and even helped the Hornets reach the playoffs for the first time in franchise history. “Grandmama” was so good that the Hornets paid him $85 million over 12 years during the 1993 off-season after just two seasons with the team. However, Johnson suffered a back injury that derailed his athleticism, and he played just 51 games in his third season with averages of 16.4 PPG, 8.8 RPG, and 3.6 APG. While Johnson did play in 162 out of 164 possible games over the next two seasons and averaged 19.7 PPG, 7.8 RPG, and 4.5 APG during that span, he was not the same after that back injury, and he was traded to the Knicks during the 1996 off-season for the backup power forward on this all-time team.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF2: Anthony Mason (1996-00)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-NBA 3rd Team, 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 13.4 PPG, 10 RPG, 4.8 APG, 0.9 SPG, 0.3 BPG

Anthony Mason was acquired by the Hornets in the deal that sent Larry Johnson to the Knicks, and he turned out to be a solid player in his three years in the Queen City. Mase averaged 16.2 PPG, 11.4 RPG, and 5.7 APG, which earned him a spot on the All-NBA 3rd Team, All-Defensive 2nd Team, and helped the Hornets reach the playoffs with a 13-win improvement from last season. Although Mason was not as productive in his final two seasons in Charlotte as he was in his first, he still averaged 12.2 PPG and 9.4 RPG and helped them make the playoffs both times. However, he was traded to the Heat in the 2000 offseason despite his production with the Hornets.

&amp;#x200B;

**PF3: Elden Campbell (1999-02)**

Stats: 13.5 PPG, 7.7 RPG, 1.5 APG, 0.8 SPG, 1.8 BPG

Acquired by the Hornets from the Lakers during the 1999 season, Elden Campbell was a solid big man during his three-and-a-half-year stay in Charlotte. After averaging 15.3 PPG and 9.4 RPG during the 32 games he played during his first half-season in the Queen City, Campbell continued to be a solid role player for the Hornets during the early 2000s as he averaged 13.2 PPG, 7.4 RPG, 1.4 APG, and 1.8 BPG. Campbell, like Davis and Mashburn, were on the roster when the Hornets moved to New Orleans during the 2002 offseason, although Campbell’s numbers fell drastically in the Crescent City.

&amp;#x200B;

**C1: Alonzo Mourning (1992-95)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star

Stats: 21.3 PPG, 10.1 RPG, 1.3 APG, 0.5 SPG, 3.2 BPG

Although the Hornets fell short in the 1992 NBA Draft Lottery for the bragging rights to Shaq, they still made a really good selection with the second pick of that year’s draft with Georgetown star Alonzo Mourning. Mourning had an exceptional rookie year where he averaged 21 PPG, 10.3 RPG, and 3.5 BPG, helped the Hornets reach the playoffs for the first time, and even helped them reach the second round of the postseason as he hit the series-clinching shot in Game 4 of the first round against the Celtics. During the next two seasons, Mourning made the All-Star team in both seasons and averaged 21.4 PPG, 10 RPG, and 3 BPG. However, Mourning rejected a contract extension from the Hornets after his third season which caused the team to send him to Miami in a deal that sent Glen Rice to Charlotte.

&amp;#x200B;

**C2: Al Jefferson (2013-16)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 17.5 PPG, 8.9 RPG, 1.8 APG, 0.8 SPG, 1.1 BPG

Al Jefferson was the biggest free-agent acquisition in the short history of the Charlotte Bobcats. His first season in the Queen City turned out to be a big one for Big Al as he averaged 21.8 PPG, 10.8 RPG, and 2.1 APG which got him on the All-NBA 3rd Team as well as the Bobcats in the playoffs for the second time in franchise history. After his first season in Charlotte, the team rebranded to become the Hornets. However, Jefferson struggled with injuries during the next two seasons as he missed 52 games and averaged 14.7 PPG and 7.6 RPG during that span. After the 2015-16, Jefferson signed with the Pacers but didn’t do much over there.

&amp;#x200B;

**C3: Emeka Okafor (2004-09)**

Accolades w/Team: 2004-05 Rookie of the Year

Stats: 14 PPG, 10.7 RPG, 0.9 APG, 0.8 SPG, 1.9 BPG

As the second selection of the 2004 NBA Draft as well as the first NBA Draft selection in Charlotte Bobcats history, Emeka Okafor was a solid player during his five-year stay in the Queen City. He won the Rookie of the Year in his season in Charlotte as he averaged 15.1 PPG and 10.9 RPG despite the Bobcats’ abysmal record. Okafor continued to average a double-double in each of the next four seasons as he averaged 13.7 PPG and 10.6 RPG during that span. However, the Bobcats continued their losing ways, and Okafor was traded to New Orleans during the 2009 offseason for Tyson Chandler.

**TL;DR All-Time Hornets Roster**

|PG|**Kemba Walker**|Baron Davis, Muggsy Bogues|
|SG|**Eddie Jones**|Dell Curry, Kendall Gill|
|SF|**Glen Rice**|*Gerald Wallace*, Jamal Mashburn|

**Analysis**

* Although the Hornets might be one of the worst all-time teams, this team is still really good. Offensively, Kemba, Eddie Jones, Rice, Johnson, and Mourning all scored at least 20 PPG during their best season with the Hornets. There's lots of spacing on this team as Walker, Jones, Rice, and Johnson (in the latter two years of his Hornets tenure) could all shoot threes. Defensively, it's not the best but Jones was a steal machine (2.8) and Mourning was a block machine (3.2 BPG) with the Hornets.
* The bench is okay but it's solid all-around. B-Diddy was a very good scorer and playmaker, Jefferson was very good in the post, Dell Curry could shoot three-pointers off the bench. Defensively, Wallace and Mason were really good as both made an All-Defensive team in Charlotte.

Welcome back to another edition of **Basketball, Stat**. Hopefully you enjoyed the [last post I did on PER](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cmrkv3/basketball_stat_player_efficiency_rating_per/). As a follow up, I wanted to do a post covering **Regularized Adjusted Plus/Minus (RAPM)**. For those of you who might have missed the first post or introduction, I wanted to do a series covering many of the advanced stats or metrics that are used in the NBA. The idea is that we see these stats all of the time comparing players, but I know for myself at least, I didn't have a firm grasp of what goes into these numbers. So given that, I wanted to build that understanding for myself and share what I find!

&amp;#x200B;

# The Basics

To get to **RAPM**, we first have to get to **APM**, and we will have to do some work just to get there! So to start, **APM** is a variation of the standard **Plus/Minus** stat. If you're unfamiliar with Plus/Minus, it is a very simple concept: while a player is on the court, whatever the net score for his team is translates to his Plus/Minus. In other words, if Player A enters the game with a score of 50-50, then exits the game with his team winning 75-70, he would have a Plus/Minus of **+5** for that ""**stint**."" This stat is cumulative and you can use it for certain stretches of a game (e.g. the Lakers were +10 when LeBron was on the court in the first half), or for an entire game (e.g. even though the Lakers lost, they were +3 when LeBron was on the court), or even throughout the season (e.g. the Lakers are only 4th in the West, but are +100 with LeBron on the court so far this season).

But I'm sure you can already see the potential flaws in using standard Plus/Minus to measure player performance. For example, it doesn't account for competition or other players on your team. You can put just about any player as the fifth in a lineup of Steph, LeBron, AD, and Giannis, and that player will have a positive Plus/Minus. Similarly, if your minutes only come against garbage-time lineups, you're Plus/Minus will be higher than it should be. But this also raises some questions: Does a player with an unexpectedly high Plus/Minus benefit from circumstances, or is he doing something that creates value that we might not be seeing? Is a player with an unexpectedly low Plus/Minus not as good as we thought, or is he just in an unfortunate situation? Well to try and answer some of these questions, many people have tried to tweak the stat to account for various things. But **Dan Rosenbaum** was the one who really articulated and defined the stat in 2004. Here's part of what he wrote:

&gt;However, these “unadjusted” plus/minus ratings do not measure the value of a player per se; they measure the value of the player relative to the players that substitute in for him.  In addition, there are differences in the quality of players that players play with and against.  A weak starter on a team with exceptionally good starters (relative to bench players) will generally get a very good unadjusted plus/minus rating – regardless of their actual contribution to the team.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thus, a better measure of player value would “adjust” these plus/minus ratings to account for the quality of players that a given player plays with and against.  In addition, it would account for home court advantage and for clutch time/garbage time play.  Thus, unlike in unadjusted plus/minus ratings, these “adjusted” plus/minus ratings do not reward players simply for being fortunate to being playing with teammates better than their opponents.

But even with that, there's still a lot of ambiguity around APM, as there are many different versions by different people with slight tweaks. But we will focus on the work Dan did for APM at first, and that will launch us into RAPM!

&amp;#x200B;

# The ""Formula"" - APM

***Disclaimer***\*: While I do have a Masters in Engineering, it's been a long time since I've had any graduate level math classes. I'm going to do my best to explain this at a high level, but I don't doubt that there will be some things I've misunderstood or miscommunicated. If you are a graduate level math expert, please feel free to correct or clarify anything I might have mistakenly misrepresented, and I will edit and credit you.\*

APM is going to be much tougher to explain, because it's not simply calculated by plugging numbers into a formula and getting a number back. To get APM, we must return to our college math classes and remember how to do a linear regression. But fear not! This is not a subpar attempt to teach you linear algebra, so I will do my best to explain it in a way the average basketball fan can understand.

Returning to our Plus/Minus example, let's take the idea of **stints**. We can define a **stint** as a period of play in which no substitutions were made and that will have a margin (e.g. +2 if Team A wins that stint by 2 points). In his original article, Rosenbaum observed over 60,000 stints over two seasons in order to calculate his first public set of APM stats.

For each stint, we have 10 players on a court, 5 players for Team A, the home team, and 5 players for Team B, the away team. Let's call the players for Team A as follows: P₁, P₂, P₃, P₄, P₅. And then for Team B, we will have: P₆, P₇, P₈, P₉, P₁₀.

If a player is playing on the home team, P = 1. If a player is playing on the away team, P = -1. And if a player is not in the game for that stint, P = 0.

APM tries to figure out how these players work together to reach the margin on the court during that time, while also accounting for home court advantage (b₀). So let's lay that out:

&amp;#x200B;

Margin =  b₀ + b₁P₁ + b₂P₂ + b₃P₃ + b₄P₄ + b₅P₅ -+ b₆P₆ + b₇P₇ + b₈P₈ + b₉P₉ + b₁₀P₁₀

&amp;#x200B;

And ""Margin"" is the offensive rating (points per 100 possessions) of Team A - the offensive rating of Team B during that stint. Quick note to say that we use offensive rating difference instead of actual score difference in case one team gets more possessions than the other. This makes it a ""per 100 possessions"" margin.

&amp;#x200B;

If we were actually in a college linear algebra class, this is the part where we would start using matrices with lots of 1s, 0s, and -1s to solve for the ""b"" coefficients. But alas, we're not, so I'll save you the eye-sore and just assume we run a linear regression here.

But in simple terms, what the regression is doing is trying to find the values of all of the ""**b""s** that correspond to each player that makes this equation true over all of the stints that we are evaluating.

So this regression is solving for all of the ""b"" coefficients, and that is ultimately what is each player's Pure APM (this is how Dan refers to it). You can interpret each player's Pure APM as the value a player is adding per 100 possessions according to the regression. It uses thousands of stints for data points to see how all of the ""players"" impact each other and minimize standard error of the regression. So we solve the issue of players playing with either elite or subpar lineups that will impact their standard Plus/Minus, and we get a closer representation of how much value they are adding to their team.

If you look at these raw values, you will absolutely see some outliers, and even small adjustments to the numbers will cause huge swings in the results. So Dan does a few things to try and adjust his results and turn Pure APM into APM, but this is where we will part ways with Dan's APM and introduce **RAPM!**

&amp;#x200B;

# The ""Formula"" - RAPM

As we begin our discussion on RAPM, this is where things can get extremely math-heavy! Again, I won't deep-dive into what would be covered in a college linear algebra class, but if you wish to do so yourself, [here](https://squared2020.com/2017/09/18/deep-dive-on-regularized-adjusted-plus-minus-i-introductory-example/) is a great article that gets into that level of detail. I also want to drop the name of Jermias Engelmann here, since he's largely credited with the creation of RAPM. He did an awesome lecture on it you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuC0YZTADcE).

But with that said, let's talk about what RAPM is compared to APM. So with APM, we will inevitably have instances where there are players with small player times that result in giant outliers. Since APM is accounting for all of the relationships of how the players impact each other, this will affect the whole model, and you will end up with some extremely ""off"" values that don't make sense. On top of that, even the numbers that do make sense will have a large mathematical margin of error according to the model. And again, small tweaks in any numbers in the model could impact things drastically.

So **RAPM** applies a **filter**, to put it simply. The filter is a technique called **ridge regression** that attempts to filter out the ""bad"" pieces of data without changing the ones that are valid. For those interested, here's the equation:

&amp;#x200B;

β = ( X^(T)X + ƛI )^(-1)X^(T)Y

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't a perfect analogy by any means, but for the less-mathematically inclinded, you can think of it kind of like a water faucet that hinges on the value of  ƛ (lambda) in the filter equation. If lambda is zero, it's like the faucet is turned all of the way on, meaning every piece of data gets through, so at lamba = 0, RAPM is the same as APM since the filter isn't actually filtering anything. Conversely, as lambda approaches infinity, it's as if the faucet is turned completely off, so none of the data gets through, and RAPM = 0 for everyone! So we need to find the sweet spot for lambda, so that we're getting the right amount of data. We want as much data as possible where we still have a low margin of error. It's not extremely important for us here at this level, but if you're curious at all, a guy named Joseph Sill [wrote a paper](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/joeSillSloanSportsPaperWithLogo.pdf) for the Sloan Conference and found that the ideal lambda is close to 2,000 for 1 year of data, or close to 3,000 for 3 years of data.

So when you apply this filter, it gives us a much better balance in terms of which data is used. You won't over the issue of ""overfitting,"" where it takes every piece of data, including the guy who played 5 minutes and went 4/4 from 3, and had a Plus-Minus of +10 in those random minutes. This kind of data throws off normal APM and would likely overrate that player, because it doesn't necessarily recognize this as an outlier automatically. But RAPM does!

So that is how RAPM is calculated! There really is lots of room for minor variations, so if you go looking at various RAPM calculations that are available online, you might notice they're all different. Again, given the nature of how it's calculated, that's just going to be part of the package with RAPM, but in general, the numbers should all be relatively close and ultimately tell you the same information with only slight nuances. For example, some people will calculate O-RAPM and D-RAPM separately, then add the two together for overall RAPM. Some won't separate them. Some will use 2 seasons of data at a time, some will use just 1. Some will have slightly different values of lambda. So it's important when looking at RAPM measurements to realize what the model is using.

&amp;#x200B;

# Taking a Step Back: Strengths and Weaknesses

So at this point, you might have realized that we haven't used a single basketball value in calculating RAPM other than the score of the game. That's one my favorite things about this stat! Ultimately, the point of basketball is to outscore your opponent, and you do that by maximizing the difference between the rate at which you score and the rate at which your opponent scores. And RAPM focuses on players doing that exclusively. Your points scored, rebounds, and assists absolutely play a part in how well you do that, but RAPM looks below the surface of those numbers to see how you're impacting the game based on the scores while you're in the game, while accounting for who else is on the floor.

But with that said, there's still some head-scratching results at times. And given the nature of how it's calculated, RAPM makes it extremely difficult to go back and find where the errors come from. That perhaps is my biggest frustration with the stat. Going through people's RAPM data, and seeing an extremely random player in the top 10 raises lots of questions: Is this player extremely underrated? Do we need to adjust the model because we're getting an outlier result? Are we going to get this outlier result no matter how we adjust and we just need to ignore it? We also often get players ""drafting"" off others. Said another way, often times a pair of players' minutes lineup to the point where they play up to 80% of their minutes together. In such cases, it's hard to fully separate their evaluation in the regression, so often one will be boosted by the other or dragged down.

So again, I think we'll see something that's a common theme with every advanced stat out there, we can't rely on RAPM blindly. RAPM is something that helps us uncover the players that traditional box score stats miss, the Shane Battiers of the world. But even when we see an unexpected player, RAPM alone isn't reliable enough to know that a player is a positive impact player. So ultimately I treat it as a clue or a piece of the puzzle, as should be the case with any stat or player evaluation. But we can be more specific here and say that this is a tool that is looking specifically for impact on the scoring difference, regardless of the box score. So RAPM is somewhere where a player that is creating value on defense, via screen assits, or through hockey assists would shine. Executing to a well-designed scheme and being in the right spot that enables your teammate to get an open shot is something that is recognized by RAPM (not directly, but through impact on scoring margin).

&amp;#x200B;

# Historical Examples

Again, we want to look back at actual data from past years to compare historical data to what we expect to see from RAPM. But as we discussed earlier, RAPM does not necessarily have a single, specific way to calculate, as there are different values of theta, multi-year vs single-year datasets, etc. So we need to choose one data source, and I will be looking at [this website](https://basketball-analytics.gitlab.io/rapm-data/) and their calculated RAPM. In their ""About"" section, they detail how they've calculated the RAPM, but for simplicity, they are using a single-year RAPM calculation, where ORAPM and DRAPM are both calculated and added together.

We can really make our main points about RAPM just by looking at one data set, so let's take a look at the top 10 from the 2018-19 regular season:

|Rank|Player|Team|Poss|ORAPM|DRAPM|RAPM|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Kevin Durant|GSW|12,315|5.2647|1.4193|6.684|
|2|Danny Green|TOR|9.830|4.297|2.1749|6.4719|
|3|Stephen Curry|GSW|10,669|4.3916|1.0492|5.4409|
|4|Paul George|OKC|13,310|1.8271|3.5296|5.3567|
|5|Jrue Holiday|NOP|11,097|3.2686|1.7695|5.0382|
|6|Derrick White|SAS|7,424|2.5176|2.2822|4.7998|
|7|Jayson Tatum|BOS|10,820|2.0052|1.9543|3.9595|
|8|Joel Embiid|PHI|9,886|2.406|1.4051|3.8111|
|9|Al Horford|BOS|8,644|3.145|0.5891|3.734|
|10|Jimmy Butler|PHI|8,225|2.7189|0.9049|3.6238|

Well that's interesting! With our first small set of data, we already have quite a few unexpected results! Durant at 1 makes sense, and Steph Curry at 3 being an example of someone who plays often with him and is an elite player in his own right also makes a lot of sense. Paul George had an incredible season last year, so him at 4 looks solid as well. But Danny Green at 2, Jrue Holiday at 5, and Derrick White at 6 are huge surprises! So again, we don't want to take these numbers as prescriptive, so our takeaway shouldn't be ""Danny Green was better than Steph last year."" That's clearly not the case for anyone that follows basketball.

But it should prompt us to ask, ""Did Danny Green, Jrue Holiday, and Derrick White provide a lot of value that we're not seeing in the box score?"" I would guess the answer is yes here, but to know, we really need to dig in to each of those player's seasons. We need to watch film to see what they're doing on defense and off the ball. We need to look at spacing data to see if maybe Danny Green's shooting is drawing players to him and increasing the spacing on the floor while's he's here. We need to look at other players on their teams and see if they have similar RAPMs that could be positively impacting these numbers.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, we see a number of players far down the rankings that we would expect:

* Kemba Walker ranked 460, with an RAPM of -0.5252
* Ben Simmons ranked 445, with an RAPM of -0.4669
* Devin Booker ranked 435, with an RAPM of -0.4186
* Blake Griffin ranked 425, with an RAPM of -0.3952
* D'Angelo Russell ranked 390, with an RAPM of -0.2611

Several of these I expected, while others were big surprises. Devin Booker is often someone talked about who puts up ""empty stats."" Let me say that I don't fully believe that's the case, but I do think his point scoring output has caused him to be overrated, and he hasn't impacted winning at a high level. But does this mean Devin Booker is a bad player? Absolutely not! It means that if assumed Devin Booker was going to be a future All-Stat, we should re-think that opinion and look more closely about the areas of his game that we might be missing. Is he missing lots of defensive rotations? Is he over-shooting and dragging down his and/or his team's scoring efficiency? Again, it's something we have to watch out for, but RAPM isn't going to tell us; it simply alerts us of a potential player misevaluation.

# Conclusion

So essentially, **RAPM is a ""jumping off"" point**. It's a signal that maybe we're missing something. Looking back at this list, I would say that Al Horford in the top 10 makes a lot of sense, but it's not an opinion that would be widely accepted 5 years ago. He's another player in the Shane Battier mold that impacts the game without filling up the box score. RAPM tells us that. But that doesn't mean we can blindly accept it! I would be hard pressed to believe that Danny Green was the best player on the Raptors, much less the 2nd best player in the league last year. But I would venture a guess that his impact was underrated by the average fan. Similar things can be said for Jrue Holiday and Derrick White (and I'm especially interested into digging into how White ended up there!).

Since RAPM was invented, there have also been several new metrics created that are improvements on RAPM, such as **RPM** and **PIPM**. I will likely visit both of those metrics in a future post.

But hopefully this was helpful for you and educational! I know that for me, learning how APM and RAPM were calculated was extremely helpful in terms of understanding what I'm really looking at when I see these numbers.

**The Rules:**

1. There are 3 rounds and every round a team can steal or protect a player

2. You can only steal a player that has played a game for your team in the past

3. If a player has been protected or stolen before your turn, the team cannot steal him (no double stealsies).

4. The order is determined by last years records (think NFL draft) and it is a straight draft ie. not serpentine 

5. Think 2k franchise fantasy draft for salary rules. No salary cap or tax for the first season only. Trade salary rules still apply

6.  Trading stolen players is allowed (See the Grizzlies as an example of stealing just trade again)

**[VOTING FORM HERE](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/XKYTVZ7)**


****

* **Only Players Who Were Selected In the Lotto Era are Eligible**

* **So only players selected from 1985 on are eligible for this exercise. (See previous posts for more explanation as to why)**
  * Only 16 teams will be created, 1 team for each lotto pick and 2 additional teams representing picks 15-30 and the second round

* **Positions and Peak is Taken into Account**

  * Each player is assumed to be at their absolute peak of their powers

* **Teams are seeded by total cumulative Win Shares on the team** 

 * This isn't a perfect method, but it's pretty fair and did a pretty good job of positioning the best teams vs the worst teams. So for example the #1 overall seed is the #1 picks team (no surprise) with a cumulative WS total of  1,412.3 and their match up is the #12 picks team (again no surprise) with a total cumulative WS of 424. This way a team like the second round picks team doesn't have to go against the #1 picks team right away. 




********

**MATCHUPS**

* **Left Side of Bracket**


- **[#1 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cgvtu5/xpost_rnba_all_time_draft_picks_team_1_selection/)** vs **[#12 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/clkrw8/all_time_nba_draft_team_12_selections/)** 

 * Not a ton of drama here, this pits probably the most talented team in the field vs easily the worst team. I can't imagine anyone voting against the #1 squad here, they should coast easily into the next round. 

- **[Second Round Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cn5yyg/all_time_nba_draft_team_second_round_picks/)** vs **[#13 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cm0dya/all_time_nba_draft_team_13_selections/)**
 * This is a really interesting match-up, the Second Round team is a much more complete team. They have a ton of talented bigs and a lot of defensive verstatility that allows them to go big or small. Rodman and Draymond are both great guys to throw at Malone, Malone will still get buckets, but he's really going to labor. The key to this match-up will be if Kobe and the other scoring guards will be contained. 

- **[#9 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ckbxz5/all_time_nba_draft_team_9_selections/)** vs **[#8 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cjvz66/all_time_nba_draft_team_8_selections/)**
 * This is another pretty non-competitive match-up. The #8 picks team is going to be killed inside by STAT and outside by Dirk. I don't really see any realistic way the #8 picks can contend

- **[#2 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ch96nt/all_time_draft_picks_team_2_selection/)** vs **[#7 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cjea5h/all_time_nba_draft_team_7_selections/)**
 * This is a really tough break for the #7 picks team, who I thought could make a bit of a run, as their guards get to face Jason Kidd and Gary Payton who will be able to hound both KJ and Steph. LMA and Zo should really feast on the bigs on the #7 team, Nene and Roy Tarpley will really have to play at the top of their game. The #7 picks only hope is that Steph and Mullin just go nuclear at the same time, but even still it should be a bit on an uphill battle. 

****

* **Right Side of Bracket**

- **[#5 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ciiu10/all_time_nba_draft_team_5_selections/)** vs **[#14 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cmb7it/all_time_nba_draft_teams_14_selections/)**

 * The #14 picks are facing one of their worst match-ups in the entire field. Prime Wade and Pippen can absolutely neutralize the best perimeter threats and the lack of a back-to-the basket big allows Garnett to be unleashed. I would imagine this game would get ugly fast. The #14 picks can shoot, and they're going to have to shoot a ton to even really compete. 

- **[Picks 15-30, First Round](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cmrcfk/all_time_nba_draft_teams_best_of_the_rest_of_the/)** vs **[#10 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ckpe58/all_time_nba_draft_teams_10_selections/)**

 * This is a really fascinating match-up, both teams mirror each other to a degree, especially with their strengths at wing. Dumars, Kawhi, and Giannis are probably some of the best defenders you can imagine for JJ, Pierce, and PG13, but at the same time the are all pretty good defenders in their own right. The #10 picks might want to lean heavily on Brook Lopez's spacing to draw Gobert and the other bigs from the basket. The 15-30 picks team is really deep and really versatile and should be able to counter any lineup thrown at them. This should be a close match-up, but the #10 picks might be out-manned here.

- **[#3 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/chnuk6/all_time_draft_picks_team_3_selection/)** vs **[#11 Picks Team](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cl4lfo/all_time_nba_draft_team_11_selections/)**

 * There is a common theme so far with this match-ups, teams that heavily rely on the 3 vs more atheltic opponents who can throw multiple defenders at their shooters. The #11 team is the best shooting team in the field by a pretty sizable margin, but they have a really hard challenge trying to contain the wings and bigs on the #3 picks team. Grant Hill and Billups will be key in this match-up, both will be able to clamp down on some of the shooters on the #11 team. The #11 team is going to just have Klay, Reggie, JJ, and Houston running off screens the entire game. All it will take is one missed switch and they will drain a 3. I have no doubt that the #11 picks team will score, but I'm skeptical about if they can defend the #3 picks, especially the bigs. Embiid and Pau are really going to feast (no offense to Myles Turner, but he is going to really have his hands full). Klay can check Harden, but he's not going to be able to slow him down enough. The real problem is who guards Melo? You can go big and throw Horry on him, but he'll just blow by him, and if you put Klay on him he's just going to bully him. 

- **[#4 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ci2vzi/all_time_draft_picks_team_4_selection/)**  vs **[#6 Picks Team](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/civr4c/nba_all_time_draft_team_6_selections/)** 

 * What a great guard matchup, CP3 and Russ vs Lillard and Brandon Roy, but I'm afraid that CP3 and Russ will have the upper hand (sorry Portland fans). Defensively it's not a bad matchup for CP3 and Russ, obviously Lillard and Roy will score, but prime CP3 is an all-time great PG defender and Russ's athleticism should prove difficult for Roy. The problem with the #6 picks is the lack of depth in the frontcourt, Bosh is going to be able to get whatever shot he wants when he wants it. Kaman and Noel really don't stand much of a chance. 

****

Well there it is, the first round for the tournament. There's a couple of tough contests, but I expect to see a lot of blowouts. Voting will close tomorrow at 9 am and the next round will be posted shortly after that. I'm also really excited to show the results of a NBA 2K custom sim that /u/FudgeCheese12 put together that will allow us to compare, to a degree, how the consensus here aligns with the simulation on 2K. I'll have more on that tomorrow, but I just wanted to shout out /u/FudgeCheese12 for all of his hard work.

#*Who would you choose and why?*#

#*How would you build around them? What kind of players? What play-style?*#

##**The Joker**##

* 2018 - 2019 Regular Season: **Games Started - 80**; PPG - 20.1; **AST - 7.3**; TRB - 10.6; **STL - 1.7**; BLK - .7

* 2018 - 2019 Post Season: **Games Started - 14**; **PPG - 25.1**; **AST - 8.4**; **TRB - 13**; **STL - 1.1**; BLK - .9


* One of the best offensively versatile big men in the league. Amazing BBIQ. Excellent distributor and creator. 

* Not the most athletic and has some holes in his defense but not a huge liability. 

##**JoJo** 

* 2018 - 2019 Regular Season: Games Started - 60; **PPG - 27.5**; AST - 2.7; **TRB - 13.6**; STL - .7; **BLK - 1.9** 

* 2018 - 2019 Post - Season: Games Started - 11; PPG - 20.2; AST - 3.4; TRB - - 10.6; STL - .7; **BLK - 2.3**

* One of the most athletic and dominant players on both sides of the floor. Excellent in the post and still ""raw"" (has room to improve). Very few players can guard 1v1 and poses a nightmare match-up problem for 90% of the teams in the league. 

* Still somewhat inexperienced and has trouble with double-teams (although he improved from two seasons ago). His health is a big concern but if teams can manage his load effectively during the regular season and unleash him in the playoffs shouldn't be too big of a concern but albeit still to be pointed out. 

##**KAT** 

* 2018 - 2019 Regular Season: Games Started - 77; **PPG - 24.4**; AST - 3.4; **TRB - 12.4**; STL - .9; **BLK - 1.6** 

* 2017 - 2018 Post - Season: Games Started - 5; PPG - 15.2; AST - 2.2; TRB - - 13.4; STL - .4; **BLK - 1**

* The Wolves didn't make the playoffs last season so I pulled the 18-18 post season. 

* KAT is little different compared to the above and I honestly didn't watch much of him so I'm not going to expand about him more. I'll let you guys expand more.

* However I do remember him being very passive during the playoffs. Never demanding the ball much.  

#**Some things to consider**#
* Jokic has a higher floor then Embiid; he has great BBIQ and is so versatile. I can't think of a single player that has similar skillet as him in the league. 

* Embiid has a lower floor but I think has a higher ceiling. He is still so raw and inexperienced but still dominating the league. If he works on his shooting and learns how to utilize doubles to create for his teammates I can honestly see him being an MVP. 

* I personally think Simmons is holding him back to a certain extent. Replacing Simmons with a PG who can space better and doesn't clog the paint would do take his game to another level. 

* Although I'm wary of Embiid's health I don't think it should be too much of a concern.

1.) Blazer fan who watched every minute of the WCSF

2.) Not sold on Jamal as neither the 2nd star to Jokic nor a point guard for a championship team

**The trade:**

Jamal Murray+Paul Millsap for Jrue Holiday+Darius Miller

Innocently think this is a good trade for both sides especially if Denver doesn't truly believe in Murray long term. 

**Why Denver does it:**

Not only is Jrue a far better overall point guard than Murray, but it seems Jamal's shots distributed evenly between Jrue and Gary Harris would do wonders for the Nuggets' offense. Harris felt really under-utilized vs Portland. Maybe Malone adjusts this anyway next season with Murray-Harris but Murray also has to become a better defender AND playmaker for the Nuggets to get over the hump. Rodney Hood called him [the matchup he likes](https://youtu.be/cG_GizhvqSA?t=362) at the one of the most pivotal points in the series. Trading for Grant is what makes the deal work imo. Grant will be great next to Jokic regardless. Also get a solid bench wing in Miller. Personally think this trade puts them right there with the LA teams and the Bucks as favorites.

**Why New Orleans does it:**

Who is the #1 option on offense moving forward? NAW looks good but the future core of the Pels feels like it could use a shooting/scoring boost. Murray in a pure scoring role next to good defenders and length could be amazing. Not to mention a potential closer role for Murray depending how you feel about Ingram. Plus Millsap is a great vet on an expiring.

Marc Gasol had a better DRTG, had more DWS, had a higher DPM, and had a higher BLK%. Gasol also averaged nearly double the amount of blocks than James did. Throw in the fact that Gasol's defense was amazing in the pick-&amp;-roll and was great at switching onto smaller players. 

Gasol also helped propel Memphis to the #1 DRTG in the NBA and was the reason Memphis was both #1 in OPP PPG &amp; #3 in OPP FG%. And this showed due to the fact that Memphis made the WCF.

Now Gasol *may* not have passed the eye-test as the league's best defender but both team &amp; advanced statistics prove otherwise.

I realized this when I was reading through the comments on the post asking you to name your top 5 centers. I saw a lot of people put Hakeem number 1, which, as good as he was, is extremely disrespectful to Kareem. Don't get me wrong, I love Olajuwon's game, but people have been calling him underrated and overlooked for quite a bit, and now everybody is on the bandwagon. He is a top 5 center for sure, maybe top 2 even. But just because he gets disrespected often does not mean he is a better player. I am not going to bother making the comparison between his career and Kareem's, because it seems very clear who had a better one. The same thing happens with a decent amount of overlooked/underrated players, with people acting like they are better just because not many fans take notice of their play.   I'd say a good example of this in today's NBA might be Conley. No knock on his game, I like him a lot, but he hasn't been an all-star simply because the other WC guards were/are better than him. People act like he is been getting snubbed for years when, in reality, you could make a reasonable argument for him in 1 or 2 season at best. Sorry if this sounded like a rant.

So if the Lakers go big, it means the Clippers big (Trez probably) guards Boogie.  Which leaves Kawhi or PG to guard Anthony Davis.  Do you think either can?  We just saw Kawhi put the clamps on Giannis, does that mean he could handle AD as well?

PG is a little taller, but everybody always talks about how strong Kawhi is so I would think Kawhi would have a better shot.  In which case, AD is forced to guard one of these two guys which is a mismatch the other way.

Second, he shot 47% FG, which was better than Dirk who shot 41% FG and really struggled from the field throughout the series. Lebron actually made more 3 pointers in the series than Dirk. The only real stinker was Lebron's free throw shooting which is always a weakness for him (60% in the 2011 Finals). If he makes a couple more of his free throws he would have averaged 24/25ppg instead of 18.

But most importantly, Lebron was being double teamed on his screen and rolls, and double teamed on his postups. The Mavs actually went over all of Lebron's screen even when he was way out at the 3 point line 30 feet deep. His defender would go over the screen and the roll defender would press up resulting in a double team. Lebron would pass to the roll man, and Bosh or Haslem became decision makers with the ball which they were truly terrible at (eg. Bosh just dropped the dribbled the ball and lost it or fell down on some plays, Haslem would hesitate to shoot the open mid-range jumper giving the defense time to recover from the pnr.

And from his postups, Miami's shooters didn't convert. Mike Bibby in particular was bad shooting 29% from 3. Mike Miller shot 38% from 3 which is very good. But compare that to the 2012 Finals. In the 2012 Finals Miller shot **63% from 3**. Mike Bibby was gone and Shane Battier was on the team and he shot 57% from 3 in the 2012 Finals. Norris Cole, Wade, Jones, and Bosh all shot north of 40% from 3 also in the 2012 Finals.

I contend that the real difference between the 2011 Finals and the 2012 Finals was that the Heat role players made their shots in 2012 and did not in 2011. In 2011 Lebron was one of the better 3 point shooters on the Heat. In 2012, he was the worst which was a good sign for the Heat since that meant the actual 3 point specialists were hitting.",True,False,,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,63274,public,self,Lebron James did not choke in the 2011 NBA Finals.,0,1565752765,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/coy6vc/lebron_james_did_not_choke_in_the_2011_nba_finals/,,,,,,,,,,,,
