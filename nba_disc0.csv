ESPN has been posting the All-Time lineups for each team, and we were debating who's All-Time lineup would win: Warriors vs Lakers. The gut instinct is to go with Lakers: Magic, Jerry West, Kobe, Kareem, Shaq with either Phil Jackson or Pat Riley as coach. But the more I think about it, I don't hate the Warrior's chances with Curry, Klay, KD, Draymond, Wilt and Steve Kerr as coach. Let's assume they're playing by today's rules and all players are at their primes.

I would imagine the match-ups would be:
West-Curry
Magic-Thompson
Kobe-Green
KAJ-KD
Shaq-Wilt?

I gotta think the first team has some variation of Giannis, Anthony Davis, LeBron James, James Harden, and maybe Kawhi? I really don’t know since it’s a shortened season. Makes it hard to say.

Hey everyone - the reception to my video on Harden's deceleration was excellent (much appreciated) so figured I'd share this new one. In this skills science video analysis, I broke down Harden’s step back jumper technique, including his two main variations &amp; multiple modifications to keep the defense guessing via the lens of biomechanics &amp; sports science. Thanks to the mods for letting me post.

Here’s a table of contents, header (sub-headings):

\- 0:00 Intro

\- 0:29 The step back (#1 - horizontal space, #2 - lateral space)

\- 3:16 Modifications (timing variation, step back leg position, sequenced off another move, walk back, off the right leg)

For those at work or the hard of hearing, I've transcribed subtitles on YouTube so sound isn't required.

Summary (will do my best without visuals): According to NBA advanced data, Harden shoots roughly 61% of his 3's on step backs and hits at a clip of roughly 37%. He utilizes two different step back variations to either create horizontal space (when the defender is playing him relatively straight up) or more lateral space (when the defender is playing him on one shoulder, typically the left shoulder). In the former case, he uses a jab dribble to his left leg, deweights and shifts load to his left leg to create a ""stretch-shorten"" cycle (SSC) to generate a high level step back thrust while timing it with the defender being on his heels. On the step back, he again uses the SSC principle with his feet to generate quick lift and get off a clean release (in the video, he also kicks out his leg for the and-1). To create lateral space, Harden starts with a similar SSC off his left leg but then goes into a lateral gather step and lateral hop to generate a large thrust and create space. On the lateral move - as he loads for his jumper - you'll often see his R leg stabilize while his L leg is in the SSC position to generate the quick upwards lift. Overlying both of these moves, is that everything is in rhythm which optimizes coordination and the compact sequence. Lastly, Harden has numerous modifications to keep defenders off the scent including using his dribbling cadence to vary timing, changing his step back leg position, sequencing off another move.

For reference, I’m a DPT and youth basketball coach well-versed in sports science and biomechanics, with sports rehab &amp; performance clinics in West LA and Valencia, CA.

Melo in his prime was thought of as a decent slasher but his finishing rates at the rim were middling-to-below-average. 

He wasn’t a particularly good passer or defender (both man and team defense, although he had some good stretches of play defending the post). 

His post-up efficiency was average/below average for much of his career. His three point shooting was slightly below league average for his career, although he had some good three point shooting years. 

His mid-range game was heavily lauded but his shooting %’s from 10-16 and 16-23 ft. are 40.4% and 41.6%, solid but not otherworldly (both roughly in line with league averages/slightly above average, although he did author a few 44-45% seasons from those ranges). 

He was a good rebounder for his position, didn’t turn the ball over much, and was excellent at getting to the line, shot well from there. 

Is this a fair appraisal? I know a player is more than the sum of his parts, but I’m genuinely curious as to what Melo’s really great stand-alone skills were. I tend to think he’s a little overrated and his supporting casts (I’m too lazy to check but I remember seeing that, before 2013 or so his teams were around 42-36 with him out of the lineup, a decent enough winning % over a decent enough sample size to conclude that his supporting casts were not ALL bad).

The person I was talking to said that Manu arguably wasn't even the second best player on those Spurs teams, because of Tony Parker. That got me to take a look at Parker's numbers and, frankly, I was shocked by how bad his numbers were, especially in the playoffs, for a guy who is as highly regarded as he is.

In the regular season Tony Parker had some pretty solid numbers, but none of them are really all that eye popping. He never had a single season above 10 win shares or 4.0 VORP. His career WS/48 is .140. His career TS% is only .546. His assist number aren't that impressive (5.6 apg career average, and never surpassed 8 apg), and his net rating is only a +4. That certainly doesn't make Parker a scrub, but I was expecting more impressive numbers.

So, of course, I looked at the playoff numbers, since that's where his reputation really comes from, right? The guy has 4 rings. But, suffice it to say, I was less than impressed. Tony Parker has a net rating of -5 in the playoffs. His TS% is only .516. He has four playoff runs with negative VORP ratings, he never averaged more than 7 apg, his career WS/48 was .084, and his best playoff run was a .152 WS/48 mark.

Here is a comparison of his advanced metrics against Manu and Duncan in the team's 4 title runs:

2003: Parker: -0.1 VORP, .468 TS%, 1.1 WS, 0.063 WS/48, -6 net rating

Manu: 1.0 VORP, .522 TS%, 2.1 WS, .152 WS/48, +10 net rating (Manu's rookie season)

Duncan: 3.1 VORP, .577 TS%, 5.9 WS, .279 WS/48, +24 net rating

&amp;#x200B;

2005: Parker: -0.2 VORP, .490 TS%, 0.6 WS, .032 WS/48, -11 net rating

Manu: 2.2 VORP, .652 TS%, 4.2 WS, .260 WS/48, +20 net rating

Duncan: 1.6 VORP, .526 TS%, 3.5 WS, .191 WS/48, +10 net rating

&amp;#x200B;

2007: Parker: 0.6 VORP, .523 TS%, 1.6 WS, .100 WS/48, -4 net rating

Manu: 1.2 VORP, .559 TS%, 2.6 WS, .204 WS/48, +12 net rating

Duncan: 1.7 VORP, .556 TS%, 3.3 WS, .214 WS/48, +13 net rating

&amp;#x200B;

2014: Parker: 0.1 VORP, .531 TS%, 1.1 WS, .071 WS/48, -6 net rating

Manu: 1.1 VORP, .593 TS%, 2.2 WS, .184 WS/48, +10 net rating

Duncan 1.0 VORP, .568 TS%, 3.2 WS, .204 WS/48, +16 net rating

&amp;#x200B;

Now, obviously, Duncan and Manu were both playoff studs. On the all time list, Duncan is third for career playoff win shares and Manu is 20th (just behind Dwayne Wade and John Stockton, and just ahead of Kevin McHale and Chauncey Billups). Parker ranks 57th in playoff win shares (despite ranking 6th in career playoff games played). He has 4 rings, but didn't even manage to post a net positive ranking a single time in any of those runs (while Duncan is a career +11 in the playoffs, and Manu is a career +8). Both Duncan and Manu generally improved their numbers in the playoffs, while Parker's numbers tended to crater more often than not.

So, that brings me back to my question: Were the Spurs ever really a big 3? Or, was Parker more of a role player who benefitted from playing with a couple of all-time playoff studs?

Also, depending on your answer to the above, does it change your perception of Manu at all, if he is looked at as more of a clear #2 (essentially the Pippen of the Spurs dynasty), as opposed to just being part of a big 3?",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,87132,public,self,Were the Spurs Ever Really a Big 3?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/gnjtuk/were_the_spurs_ever_really_a_big_3/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s also not rhetorical, I’m looking for an actual answer to this. 

So a lot is made of LeBron making 9 trips to the finals and only having three wins. 3-6 does not sound good, especially when you consider that his peers he’s being compared against have much better records. 

But when you actually analyze those 6 losses, it seems almost unfair to hold the vast majority of them against him. 

2007 was essentially unwinnable at the time, he was not ready to carry that cavs team against a prime Spurs dynasty team. It would’ve been a downright miracle The fact he was even there was incredible. 

2015 was extremely impressive that he even got to 6. Love and Kyrie both went down and he was playing with cast always from other teams against a Warriors GOAT level team. 

2017 and 18 are obviously ridiculous and should not be held against him. 

So when you really look at his losses objectively, ‘11 and ‘14 are the only ones that should be held against him as a player. But people act as though he is a finals choke. 

I firmly believe if you swap LeBron outright for any other player in nba history on those cavs teams they still lose. 

Now if the argument is that ‘11 is such a bad choke job that without winning 5-6 rings he will never be able to make up for it, that I can get behind. That finals was absolutely embarrassing and *should* be held against him.

My question is that after Lebron leaves a franchise, why do they always end up in rebuild mode. He supposedly makes his teammates better, but when he leaves they regress heavily. I personally believe this is because he runs the offense and forces other players to play as spot up shooters or lob threats, we've seen the terrifying duo of bron and ad as a lob duo, but has AD's game repressed from this? he relies on Bron's playmaking to score so will he demonstrate the same numbers without lebron?

Which of these prospects is the best fit for this season? Who is the best going forward as Klay and Steph become older vets? 

I’m gonna assume they’ll be in the top 3 or 4 picks. So the likely suspects are Anthony Edwards, Obi Toppin, Wiseman, and then maybe Lamelo.

Anthony Edwards - Would fit in well defensively and could basically be interchangeable with Wiggins as a slasher/sporadic shooter. However, GS has plenty of guards already and probably needs more help with the bigs. Edwards seems to have the most potential with his athleticism and seems like a good kid. Could be a great piece for 3 or 4 years down the road when Steph and Klay take a back seat and Edwards is entering his own.

Wiseman - Limited film but can clearly run the break and be a diver(I think that’s the word). He’d be one of the best alley oop threats on day 1, especially with the classic Draymond and Steph pick &amp; roll on the wing. He’d probably be the best option for their offense. He seems to be a good rim protector but with how tall he is, he may have some difficulty defending the perimeter. Could potentially be an Anthony Davis type player if he puts in the work and stays healthy. Could really be the main guy in 4 or 5 years. 

Toppin - He’s 22 years old but is pretty polished. He’d really solidify the Warriors small ball lineup and could offer some help right away from 3 point range. There’s a stigma about taking guys who’ve played more than 1 or two years in college this early. He also doesn’t facilitate much, despite handling the ball quite a bit. I don’t know what his ceiling is. Could he be a poor man’s Amare Stoudemire or a shorter David West? I’m not seeing him as a super star, that’s for sure. Maybe a low tier 2nd piece or a high 3rd piece. 

Lamelo - I don’t see how he fits into this team. Are they really going to let a 6’9 rookie with an insane father take the ball out of Steph’s hands? I think even if Lamelo came from a normal family it’s just not a good fit. He’s ball dominant and I’m scared about his freaky shooting mechanics (despite being a good shooter by most accounts). I think he’ll probably be a good player but it seems like the least likely fit between these 4.

Giannis also holds opponents to the lowest FG% near the rim. You could argue that Giannis has a better defensive supporting cast and that possibly inflates his advanced numbers but the Bucks' defensive rating without players such as Bledsoe, DiVencenzo, Lopez, and Matthews off the court and with Giannis on the court is still the best defensive rating in the league. 

One could also argue that Davis has been more versatile defensively this season but the chart below reveals that they've spent indentical percentages of their playing time guarding each of the 5 positions with the only noticeable difference being Davis spending nearly 9% more of his playing time guarding centers.

Another argument I've read is that Davis has spent more of his playing time guarding tougher offensive options, but once again based on the chart below, it reveals that they spend identical percentages of their playing time guarding each specific offensive option.

[https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA\_stats\_per\_game.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats_per_game.html)

3PA have gone from 2.8 in 1980 to 33.9 in 2020.

FGA (including 3s) have been as high as 109.4 in 1961, as low as 78.2 in 1999, and are currently 88.8.

PTS have been as high as 118.8 in 1962, as low as 91.6 in 1999, and currently are 111.4.

The relative FG% of 2P vs 3P (balance would be 1.5) was as high as 2.26 in 1983 (meaning 2P was more efficient), as low as 1.32 in 2004 (meaning the 3P was more efficient), and is currently 1.46 (almost balanced).

I'll give one suggestion below, but you can cover more ground if you want:

To me essentially what has happened is players have gotten really good shooting the 3. It started being undervalued in the early 1990s and by the mid 1990s was completely unbalanced. Just recently has the league caught on and balanced the situation almost. 

However, there are so many 3s and it may even get worse.  Here are FG% by shot location:

* Corner 3s: .425
* Low Paint: .600
* Other 3s: .369 (on average)
* Other 2s:  .425 (roughly on average) (this is completely inefficient relative to any 3)

[https://www.82games.com/locations.htm](https://www.82games.com/locations.htm)

I don't see how they can balance this while keeping the corner 3. More of an issue, the only shot better than a 3 is a shot right under the basket. Right now, the numbers say:

1. Corner 3,
2. Shot by basket,
3. any 3, and lastly
4. any other 2.

Somehow the 3 has to get harder even without a corner 3 and/or 2s have to get easier.  Otherwise, it will just be dunks, layups, short shots, and 3s at some point.

The easiest solution would be to move back the 3 as well as remove the corner 3.  How far do you go?

Two system guys with strong scoring performances battled back-and-forth, not necessarily dazzling you with their highlight reel performances but with their excellent fundamental moves to get buckets and execution of great offenses. But one was standing out a little more than the other.


The transfer from Fordham had to wait until his senior year to make a huge impact on the Villanova roster. And when he did, his talent shined. Considered to be a PJ Tucker comparable, Golden State saw their new Draymond Green in the scoring forward. They would look over criticism over his athleticism, age and size and would instead see the hard-working leader oozing potential. 


His 14 points, 4.6 rebounds and 2.1 assist per game included 13 20+ point games, 4 double-doubles, all while on the worst team in the NBA and with questionable guard play. Despite not being a 'point-forward' and his statistics showing that he works better off-the-ball, he's managed to earn his paycheck and more importantly, earn his spot in the future.


What is even more impressive has been his development as a scorer. You were drafting him because he could score but in college, he struggled with the pull-up jumper game. With the expectation that he was joining a fast-pace Kerr motion offense, and his lack of point-forward skills, his 'catch-and-shoot' style wasn't necessarily enough. Because of how the guards of the Warriors loved to use their handles to open up the court, working off the dribble was an essential piece of the game.


Since joining the Warriors, he's been a 40.2% pull-up shooter and has found comfort in taking more shots from the situation--2.1 out of his 10.5 per game, with makes within 10 feet from the basket not being included.  Despite still having comfort in the catch-and-shoot game, he's tested the waters on improving his handles and his shot off the dribble. His 4 shot-attempts, averaging above 50% off the dribble, is promising but his turnovers that come with developing the skill have been a minor setback. 


His transition scoring,  needs improvement. He can bust his ass down the floor but instead of following his momentum for the dunk or strong finish, [he'll pro hop and then work for the bucket](https://youtu.be/BtemW6UeBL0?t=58). Despite being an solid finisher at the rim, he acts as if he's taking a jump shot from deep and forces too much strength from his legs. He'll kick them out, as if he is attempting to draw contact, but instead he looks like an octopus flailing.   


He's an off-ball rat that will set the hard screens and work into the pick-and-roll. He lucked out going from a Jay Wright motion system into a Steve Kerr motion system because it rewards effort. Athletically, you aren't getting a top prospect but you're getting a smart prospect. He spaces the floor well, finding himself in situations were the catch-and-shoot is optimal.


When the conversation inevitably comes, deciding between Pascall and Draymond, it should be an incredibly interest debate. Paschall is by far the better scorer, better teammate and has the better ceiling that what Draymond has to offer. And defensively, Paschall matches the Green's aggression but lack the ability to guard larger defenders that Green will forever be known for. The offensive mistakes Paschall makes--mostly his turnovers due to bad passes off of the dribble-- get abused more and if he isn't able to develop better rebounding skills, his defensive aggression away from the rim can become a liability. But the potential he has shown in his first year and already finding with the weaker Warriors line-up is nerve wrecking for the rest of the NBA. 


If the Warriors want to look for their next evolution of their line-up, Paschall might just be the answer. Offensive versatility has always appeared to be the focus of Kerr--if there is a new way the team can get a bucket, he'll incorporate it into their system. His ability to score from all over the court in many different ways hasn't necessarily put fear into the eyes of us fans that hope the Warriors aren't going to ruin our basketball lives for years to come.  Even if the world thinks drafting Wiseman is the move that will take them to the next level, Paschall shouldn't go unnoticed.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,87035,public,self,Golden State's Thing of Beauty in Eric Paschall and He's the Man That Should Worry Non-Warriors Fans,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/gn2ii0/golden_states_thing_of_beauty_in_eric_paschall/,all_ads,6,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'r2py4kIXZhJ_IiwcX-RPwYQw6X6fGC4syUDcS4mDw8k', 'resolutions': [{'height': 81, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/ZqdRWvyGm-CwIPapsMh3OEHacgHvCSO3LxDBEqnFgOg.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=456ee5712d5a78da2ad42f4fef1763537f8b1007', 'width': 108}, {'height': 162, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/ZqdRWvyGm-CwIPapsMh3OEHacgHvCSO3LxDBEqnFgOg.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4aa5611051d429c584a1828674e19047954665de', 'width': 216}, {'height': 240, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/ZqdRWvyGm-CwIPapsMh3OEHacgHvCSO3LxDBEqnFgOg.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65b81b15021e08300a14a9f7c99f2bbad97a6872', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/ZqdRWvyGm-CwIPapsMh3OEHacgHvCSO3LxDBEqnFgOg.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=6502fdad978e210190a85ed1f222e38d153e341a', 'width': 480}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,

Feel free to disagree, I always love a debate

1. Jayson Tatum, whether the Celtics don’t trade the pick or they do, Tatum is the obvious choice for both Philly and Boston. If Philly wanted Tatum Boston wouldn’t have done the trade so he ends up in Boston regardless.

2. Donavan Mitchell, this was between Donavan and Bam but I’m the Lakers case I think Mitchell is the better choice, whether they keep him or use him as the centerpiece of the AD trade. Hypothetically if they used him to trade for AD then they potentially give up less picks than when they used Alonzo in the trade.

3.  DeAaron Fox, while I believe Bam is the better player, the sixers already had Joel Embiid and would not be looking to draft a center, playing behind Joel it’s likely Bam never becomes the all star he is currently. The sixers originally took Markelle Fultz who did not turn out well for them. DeAaron Fox has proven to be the best point guard from the class and has improved his shooting since being drafted. I’m not entirely sure how he fits in with the rest of the roster but I think he is the best choice for philly.

4. Bam Adebayo, originally the suns selected Josh Jackson, that turned out to be a bad idea. I would love to see Devin Booker and Bam Adebayo play together, it would be an interesting duo. I don’t know how their record changes but if they already have Bam maybe they take Luka in the next draft, that would be an interesting team.

5. Lonzo Ball, this Kong’s team was bad, I think they should take the best available player and with their current point guard off the board I believe that Lonzo is the next best player, it took a couple season for him to really hit his stride and while he’s not exactly the superstar you want, he is a good piece to build with.

6. Jonathan Isaac, this pick stays the same, I considered John Collins or Lauri Markkanen but Orlando already has a good frontcourt with Vucevic and Gordon. I think that Isaac is more of a PF but he can fit in as a SF better than Lauri it Collins. Ideally they would take a point guard but the two best ones are already off the board and at this point Markelle and Dennis Smith are reaches

7. Lauri Markkanen, this pick also doesn’t change. I imagine the timbeerwolves still trade for Jimmy because I’m just fixing the draft order, not other mistakes made by teams. Lauri has had some injuries and his last season was not great, but I blame the coaching staff. I think they mess up any other player just as much so they should stick with Lauri here.

8. Luke Kennard, this was a tough win and I narrowed it down to Kennard or Fultz. This pick may seem a bit odd as neither of them are really close to being the best available player but at the time New York still had Porzingis and needed someone to pair with him. I think that Fultz or Kennard could be good but I ultimately went with Kennard who I believe is a better player.

9. John Collins, the Dallas Mavericks didnt have a player to build around with dirk on the decline. I think they just go best available and lucky for them John Collins is still here. 

10. OG Annunoby, assuming Portland still trades for this pick I think that they improve their lackluster small forward position by taking arguably the best player available in OG Annunoby, he helps them defensively and has improve as an offensive player since being drafted, I think he fits well with Dame and CJ

11. Jarrett Allen, I considered taking Josh Hart, Markelle Fultz, or Derrick White here big with Kemba and Jeremy Lamb already being a solid backcourt I determined that Jarrett Allen is the best choice for where they were

12. Markelle Fultz, at this point I do t like many of the options for the Pistons but Markelle could potentially be a good point guard for them. Reggie Jackson’s decent bit not a great starting point guard. Maybe Markelle and Drummond can have a nice pick and roll

13. Josh Hart, he’s no Spida Mitchell but Donavans long gone by now so the Jazz take the best shooting guard and possibly player available in Josh Hart

14. Zach Collins, Bam Adebayo is off the board so the Heat go with a different big man in Zach Collins, I considered Derick White here but if I remember correctly Goran Dragic was an all star this year.

Unmentioned players:
Kyle Kuzma, I am not a Kyle Kuzma fan. I think was severely overrated his first two seasons just because he could shoot better than Ball or Ingram. I don’t think he’s strong enough to defend PFs or quick enough to defend SFs. Defensively he is positionless one a bad way. Some players compensate for bad defense with amazing offense but Kyle isn’t good enough offensively to make up for the lack of defense.

Josh Jackson, yeesh this guy was way overhyped going into the draft. He is okay on defense and bad on offense. He also has some character questions and might not even go in the first round of the draft looking back. 

Derrick White, I wanted to squeeze him in here at some point but this class is stacked and I couldn’t find a spot for him to fit in

Dennis Smith Jr, I think he could be a decent starter for a team. However he is inefficient and I don’t see him as a lottery pick in this class

Frank Ntlikina, I like Frank but he is bad offensively and hasn’t been given enough of a chance to prove he was worth a lottery pick.

This mock will be done assuming the draft order remains stagnant relative to the current standings. In this draft, more than ever, I anticipate there will be unprecedented amounts of picks down under the basis of need. This is due to the fact that there is a lot of uncertainty near the top of the big board. Team fit might triumph consensus BPA quite a few times. 

After each pick announcement, I entailed a little lineup projection for each team, basically, what the roster would look like after the rookie addition. While this is a projection for the 2020-2021 season, I used the 2019-2020 roster for simplicity. This will be denoted as Projected Squad (PS). I also have denoted the core members of each team, the foundation players, as members of the CORE list. 

***(1) Golden State Warriors***

*Selection: James Wiseman (center)*

If the Warriors don't trade their pick, this is who I think they'll select. An immediate impact big guy with terrific size. Yes, I know there are rumors that suggest they aren’t interested, BUT I almost am certain that they will look to trade this pick. If they don’t, I still see them getting Wiseman. 

CORE: Curry, Klay, Dray, Wiggins, Wiseman, Paschall, Looney, and Poole

PS: **Warriors**:

Curry/Randle

Klay/Poole

Wiggins/Paschall

Green/Chriss

Wiseman/Looney 

\----

***(2) Cleveland Cavaliers***

*Selection: Deni Avidja (forward)*

This one, I anticipate will garner some confusion, but really I think it could be a brilliant move. Advidja might be the most well-rounded player in the draft and plays with good passing skills and IQ. Cleveland was 24th in assists and last in turnovers…  Deni would fit nicely, he’s what the Cavs need right now. They don’t need another streaky scorer or guard, a forward would do just nicely. 

CORE: Garland, Sexton, Porter, Deni, Nance, and Drummond

PS: **Cavs**:

Garland/Delly

Sexton/Porter

Deni/Osman

Love/Nance

Drummond/Thompson

\----

***(3) Minnesota Timberwolves***

*Selection: Onyeka Okongwu (forward/big)*

I originally mocked Lamelo here, then thought… nah, doesn’t make sense, then I mocked Anthony Edwards... And still, it felt a bit wrong. 

This is where team fit triumphs consensus BPA most notably. Lamelo would make the team one of the worst defensively in the league, and Edwards wouldn’t help either. Minnesota rates 28th in points allowed per game. Onyeka makes complete sense to me, Minnesota get a high potential player that they can partner with KAT in the frontcourt, and help fortify their terrible defense. 

CORE: KAT, Dlo, Onyeka, Okogie, Beasley, and Culver

PS: **Wolves**:

DLo/Okogie

Beasley/Evans

Culver/Layman

Onyeka/Juan

KAT/Reid

\----

***(4) Atlanta Hawks***

*Selection: Anthony Edwards (wing)*

The consensus no.1pick by many, Edwards slides all the way to 4 and gives the Hawks a much-needed shot creator, however, he comes with issues in the department of consistency. When Trae is off the floor/off the ball, the Hawks offense stagnates. Collins is the only other established scorer they have as Reddish and Huerter are a year or two away from reaching that status. Edwards infuses their offense with athleticism and shot creation. A perfect pick-up for the Hawks. 

CORE: Trae, Collins, Reddish, Edwards, Capela, and Huerter

PS: **ATL**:

Trae/Teague

Edwards/Huerter

Reddish/Hunter

Collins/Skal

Capela/Dewayne

\----

***(5) Detroit Pistons*** 

*Selection: Lamelo Ball (guard)*

The Pistons have young talent in Sekou, Kennard, and Wood, and are led by two injury-prone players with Rose and Griffin. I see them going after their franchise point guard at 5, and pairing him with Kennard in the backcourt. Lamelo would give them a new element as he has amazing potential. Lamelo’s passing, Kennard’s shooting, Sekou’s athleticism/potential, and their promising franchise center, Christian Wood, could equate to relevancy a few years down the line. 

CORE: Wood, Lamelo, Kennard, Sekou, Griffin, Rose, Gallo, and Svi

PS: **Detroit**: 

Lamelo/Rose

Galloway/Svi

Kennard/Snell

Griffin/Sekou

Wood/Henson

\----

***(6) New York Knicks***

*Selection: Killian Hayes (guard)*

The Knicks are in a really weird place. On one hand, they need talent and potential (Cole Anthony has that) but on the other, they also need consistency and unselfishness (not as much). A Cole and RJ backcourt would be very hot and cold at times and ball movement would be nonexistent. 

That's why I see them taking Hayes as the next guard off the board. He is a good passer, young, has a high ceiling and would pair much better with RJ. Also, they both are lefthanded so they could be lefty-friends. On a more serious note, some, including myself, view Killian as the darkhorse of the draft. 

CORE: RJ, Robinson, Frank, and Randle

PS: **Knicks**:

Killian/Frank

***(7) Chicago Bulls***

*Selection: Tyrese Haliburton (guard)*

The Bulls are a bit bummed that Hayes is off the board, and take the next best true point guard in the draft. I see them eventually trading away Lavine and allowing White to be the 2, but even if they both remain, Haliburton’s consistency, relative size, and floor spacing/management is hard to turn down. 

CORE: Lavine, White, Lauri, Carter, and Tyrese

PS: **Bulls**:

Coby/Haliburton

Lavine/Valentine

Otto/Sato

Lauri/Thad

Wendell/Gafford

\----

***(8) Charlotte Hornets*** 

*Selection: Tyrese Maxey (guard)*

I see Maxey going 8, but he’s one of my favorite candidates for ROTY, especially as three-guard lineups are showing more and more success (The Thunder). Rozier is not the longterm point guard, Graham is. Maxey gives the Hornets a good shot creator and a great defender to pair him with. Watch out, the Hornets are on the rise. 

CORE: Graham, Washington, Maxey, Bridges, Rozier, and Monk

PS: **Hornets**:

Graham/Rozier

Maxey/Monk

Bridges/Martin

Washington/Mcdaniels

Zeller/Willy

\----

***(9) Washington Wizards***

*Selection: Devin Vassell (forward)*

With Wall coming back next season, I feel Vassell would add some much-needed 3&amp;D to this supercharged offensive team, and while they'd have to deal with the issue at the 5 in FA or with another pick, I feel this is the right move. Saddiq Bey was also an option. 

CORE: Beal, Rui, Bertans, Wall, Brown, Vassell, Robinson, and Ish

PS: **Wiz**:

Wall/Ish

Beal/Robinson

Vassell/Brown

Rui/Bertans

Bryant/Wagner

\----

***(10) Phoenix Suns***

*Selection: Obi Toppin (forward/big)*

The Suns have no reason not to try to swing for the fences with POTY, Obi Toppin. He has unreal athleticism, size, and is a scorer on all three levels of the court. Yeah, he’s on the older side, and pretty bad at defense, but I don’t see the Suns, even as a below-average defensive team, turning him down. They’ll have to address defense in free agency, and Toppin would have to play the 4 spot in order to fit with Ayton. 

CORE: Booker, Ayton, Oubre, Toppin, Rubio, and Bridges

PS: **Suns**:

Rubio/Jevon

Booker/Cam

Oubre/Bridges

Toppin/Saric

Ayton/Baynes

\----

***(11) San Antonio Spurs***

*Selection: Saddiq Bey (forward)*

A great 3&amp;D player that will make an immediate impact and pair nicely with their young core as they overtake Demar and Aldridge. This is a very ‘Spurs’ pick, they get good two-way play from a mature, consistent player. 

CORE: Murray, Walker, White, Demar, Bey, Johnson, Gay, and Lamar

PS: **Spurs**: 

Murray/White

Walker/Forbes

Demar/Saddiq

Lyles/Gay

Aldridge/Jakob

\----

***(12) Sacramento Kings***

*Selection: Precious Achiuwa* 

This was the hardest pick to project by far. The Kings roster on paper looks solid, they seem to have great guard depth, an upper tier SF, a good, young rotation of PF/C. Yeah, yeah, I know Bagley has had his fair share of injuries and trading Dewayne surely didn't help, but I think it must be coaching, because they greatly disappointed this year. 

I have them picking another PF. One of the best defenders in the draft, you can never have too many scrappy, defensive wings. This is a pretty generic pick, to be honest, but it seemed like the most logical. 

CORE: Fox, Hield, Bagley, Bogdan, Achiuwa, Bjelica, Barnes, and Holmes 

PS: **Kings**:

Fox/Cory

Bogdan/Hield

Barnes/Bazemore

Bjelica/Achiuwa

Bagley/Holmes

\----

***(13) New Orleans Pelicans***

*Selection: Aaron Neismith (guard)*

This is another tough one, they are built well. But I see them drafting a SG/SF, Neismith would be perfect for them, giving them another marksman to rotate off the bench, and possibly the eventual starter over Jrue. This team could be contending in a few seasons. 

CORE: Zion, Ingram, Lonzo, Jrue, Hayes, Favors, Aaron, Hart, NAW, etc!

PS: **Pels**: 

Lonzo/NAW

Jrue/Neismith

Ingram/Hart

Zion/Kenrich

Favors/Hayes

\----

***(14) Portland Trailblazers***

*Selection: Patrick Williams (forward)*

A young, long, wing that can shoot, the Blazers continue to garner fire power to surround Dame and co. with. Especially considering the lack of depth and injury woes they experienced, this pick is a safe bet to make. 

CORE: Dame, CJ, Nurkic, Collins, Simons, Williams, Hood, Melo, and Little

PS: **Blazers**: 

Dame/Simons

CJ/Trent

Hood/Williams

Collins/Melo

Nurk/Hassan

\----

That’s right, I don’t have Cole Anthony getting taken in the lottery. I see him going 15 to Orlando. So, might as well...

***(15) Orlando Magic*** 

*Selection: Cole Anthony (guard)* 

Cole Anthony and Markelle Fultz have good potential as a backcourt, Magic take BPA. 

CORE: Isaac, Fultz, Gordon, Anthony, Vuc, Fournier, and Bamba

PS: **Magic**:

Markelle/DJ

Fournier/Cole

Ennis/Ross

Isaac/Gordon

Vuc/Bamba

I get not liking a guy, I get not liking fans around a guy but it's easy to see why things get done.

Why does Michael Jordan release a 9 part documentary ?( originally set to air after the finals) and yes MJ released it they had to have his go ahead. It's pretty simple it's been 20 years MJ is fading from Relevancy, less people have watched him play. More and more people are giving LeBron credit and saying hey this might be the Goat. This is MJ's way of popping back in trying to stay relevant to people. It's why the entire 9 part documentary was a complete and total ball washing of MJ and only his side of things. Whether you are a MJ fan or not that's what that documentary was

So to see that then see Jordan fans get upset at the media asking LeBron about it or other questions is crazy. Calling it an attention grab

LeBron was asked about an NFL career that he pursued during the lockout of 2011 because Doc Rivers came out and was like He could have been the greatest NFL player ever. LeBron answered it by saying he didn't know how long the lockout was that he basically included more strength exercises in his routine and he's dreamed of being an NFL player. Another guy In the interview comes out says LeBron was offered a contract by Jerry Jones.

Excerpt from her book:

""Ending eight years after it first began and five years after losing my virginity to my father, it scares me to think how much longer the abuse would have went on had I not spit out the dreadful truth to my mother during one of our many heated disagreements.  Disagreements that were sometimes anything but pleasant and often featured no indication of love between the two of us.

So as she ranted and raved about how no slutty daughter of hers better get pregnant and bring any bastard children into her house.  I finally heard myself saying: “If I am so much of a slut, why don’t you keep your husband out of my bed?”

When I finally found the courage to let my father’s deeds tumble from my lips, I did not know what to expect, but I never in a million years would have guessed that my mother would turn on me. Her words of betrayals did far more damage to me than my father’s deeds. They spoke volumes to the fact that she really did not care about me, which my father obviously knew. It is because she was so expressive with her dislike for me that probably made my father know he could get away with violating me.

My father confessed his actions on the same day that I disclosed them to my mother. And on that frightful day of admission, I watched my mother, looking for a sign, any sign that she cared about me.

The memory of my father whispering in my ear during the wee hours of the night about the beauty of my body has played over and over in my head for many years. And as if that has not been incapacitating enough by itself, having to comprehend the fact that more often than not, he had just gotten out of the bed he shared with my mother to find his way to my bedroom has just added to the realization of the painful situation.""

However, the only reason I even knew enough about the topic was because I once had a legendary debate in high school including Thomas. I'll admit that my tone in the last post was pretty negative towards Thomas, so you'd be correct in assuming that I was debating against Thomas in this debate. Who was I debating for? None other than Jason Kidd. I made a point in the last post that there's a difference between being slept on and being underrated, so I will be careful not to call Jason Kidd underrated unless I actually think he is underrated. I'd assume most people would put Kidd in the 45-30 range on their all-time list, which is about where I think he deserves to be. However, I think that Jason Kidd is definitely slept on. I rarely ever hear him being brought up in discussions about NBA greats, especially among point guards. I usually hear Magic, Steph, Stockton, Oscar, West, Zeke, and sometimes Paul and Nash's names as the all-time great point guards, but never Kidd. Speaking of point guards, while I don't think Kidd is particularly underrated overall, I do believe him to be underrated on the all-time point guards list. All eight of the players I've just mentioned are almost always ranked above Kidd, meaning that Kidd barely makes the top 10 all-time point guards list in most people's eyes. I think he deserves better than that.

Before I get started, I'm gonna address some common arguments against my last post. I came to the conclusion that Thomas was properly rated, so people who disagreed came from both ways, some saying Thomas was underrated and some saying Thomas was overrated. The ones who said he was underrated generally said that advanced stats don't matter and if you watch the games and look at his accomplishments, he's better than his current rating. Those who said he was overrated pointed to his advanced stats and said they were atrocious for an all-time great and there's no way that someone with those stats can be rated as highly as Thomas is rated. Both of these points of view are wrong, at least in my opinion. I fall pretty much right in the middle of these viewpoints. You definitely need to watch the games if you want to make a fair assumption about a player, but you can't just do that alone because your eyes can sometimes deceive you. That's where stats come in. Stats should be used to help you analyze what you've just saw from the tape. However, you can't just look at stats and stats only, because stats need context in order to be properly utilized. If you're just looking at the advanced stats, you're probably doing something wrong, but if you're not looking at the stats at all, you're also probably doing something wrong. The best way to determine the level of greatness of an NBA player is by looking at both stats and film, and in doing so, I've determined that Isiah Thomas is neither underrated nor overrated.

# Scoring

The biggest knock on Kidd's game is his scoring, and there's good reason behind it. Kidd averaged less than 13 points per game on a putrid 40% shooting for his career. No matter what way you look at it, Kidd was bad at scoring. However, there are some aspects of his scoring that go unnoticed. He is normally labeled as a terrible three point shooter, and this simply isn't true. To begin his career, he was nicknamed ""Ason Kidd"" due to his lack of a J, but since his career started, he never stopped working on his jump shot. By the time he landed on the Nets, he wasn't the greatest shooter, but he was a decent three point shooter for his era and he could no longer be left open from three. By the time his second stint with the Mavericks, came, his jump shot was one of the most valuable aspects of his game. He made 554 three pointers from being acquired by the Mavericks in 2008 until he left in 2012, which amounted to almost 2 per game, and he shot the three at a 38.8% clip during that time. Additionally, he shot the lights out during that 2011 Mavericks playoff run, especially in the Finals, and he hit some big shots that were crucial to the Mavs during that run. At the time of his retirement, Kidd placed third on the all-time three pointers list, although with the inflation of three point attempts in the modern NBA, he sits at 10th now.

Other than his shooting, he wasn't a very capable scorer. His lack of efficiency might be a little overstated, as his true shooting percentage was 50.7%, which as I mentioned in the Thomas post, was comparable to Isiah Thomas' efficiency. This comparison has more to do with Thomas being inefficient than Kidd not being inefficient, but it should still be known. And I believe that his efficiency numbers are negatively influenced by the fact that he had the ball in his hands often without the intention to score, meaning he had to put up a lot of bad shots due to the shot clock, but even factoring that in, he still wasn't efficient. Overall, Kidd was not a great scorer, but that doesn't mean he was not a great player. Kidd was not just good, but great at pretty much everything else in basketball, so saying that he's not an all-time great is essentially saying that scoring is the only thing that matters in the NBA.

# Passing

Obviously, Jason Kidd was a great passer, and everyone knows that. As the number two in all-time assists, a five-time league leader in assists, and possessing an assist to turnover ratio of just over 3, the fact that Jason Kidd was an all-time great at passing is undeniable. If you look at the film, you would see that he constantly made passes that were unfathomable for other stars without committing many turnovers and he shares the title of ""best transition passer"" with Magic Johnson if not owning that title outright. Teammates of Kidd's who had any offensive talent were hard to come by during Kidd's prime, but Kidd made the few who did even better. Vince Carter, Richard Jefferson, Kerry Kittles, Kenyon Martin, and Keith Van Horn all experienced some significant drop-offs in production pretty soon after they weren't teammates of Kidd's anymore. Overall, I think it's pretty hard to come up with players throughout NBA history who were better passers than Kidd. I'd probably have to put Magic and CP3 ahead of him, but I think that's where the list ends. Stockton has a case as the all-time leader in assists and one of only two players two average double-digit assists for his career, but you also have to consider that he played with an easy assist target in Karl Malone for his whole career and the system he played in inflated his assist totals. Nash comes to mind as a great passer, but he consistently had some phenomenal offensive help on his team. Other than that, I don't think anyone qualifies as a better passer than Jason Kidd, and for that, Kidd deserves a lot of credit.

# Defense

Everyone knows that Jason Kidd was a good defender, but people sometimes don't notice that he's one of the greatest defensive guards in NBA history. He ranks 2nd all-time in steals and averaged an impressive 1.9 per game, but steals and blocks don't mean very much when evaluating defense. His advanced stats are indicative of an all-time great defender, but advanced defensive stats are not without flaw and therefore are not the end-all-be-all. He's a nine-time all-defensive team member, and among guards, only Kobe Bryant has made more. What's perhaps more important than any of these things is the eye-test, and as a Nets fan, I've definitely seen my fair share of Jason Kidd games. I've re-watched everything I could find for the sake of debate, and I've determined that Jason Kidd was everything you could ask for from a guard on defense. He was very tough, gave a lot of effort, always knew when to help, play passing lanes, and stay on his man, had a lot of size for a point guard and used it well, and was quick and athletic enough to keep up with all his matchups. Even when his athleticism faded as he aged, he was still the most valuable perimeter defender on a championship winning team and he was the primary defender on LeBron James who had the worst series of his career. I'd say that you have to put Jordan and Payton in front of him, but other than that, no guard throughout NBA history has a rock-solid case to be considered a better defender than him. Moncrief has a couple of DPOY's to boot, but those were the first DPOY's ever given out so the precedent that the award is almost always given to bigs had not been set yet. Kobe has more all-defensive teams than him but I think his toughness and reputation has overrated his defensive ability a tad. And Chris Paul is about even with him, both with 9 all-defensive teams and Paul having the steals titles although Kidd was able to guard more positions. Overall, I'd put Kidd third all-time in terms of defensive guards, but even if you would put him lower, there's no denying that he was an all-time great defender.

# Rebounding

Jason Kidd was one of the best rebounding guards of all time. Everyone knows this, but people seem to ignore this fact when ranking him all-time. He averaged 6.3 boards per game for his career, and that's coming from a 6 foot 4 point guard. He's 64th on the all-time rebounds list, and every single player ahead of him is either a forward or center. Thanks in large part to his rebounding, he posted 107 triple-doubles during his career, which has only been surpassed by Oscar Robertson, Russell Westbrook, and Magic Johnson. It's pretty common knowledge that Jason Kidd was a good rebounder, but no one seems to care when it comes to discussing his career. This might be because it's uncommon for point guards to be good at rebounding, so when people rank point guards, they forget to mention rebounding altogether. In any case, Jason Kidd was a great rebounder and he deserves credit for it.

# Advanced Stats

I'm going to preface this section by reiterating that advanced stats are neither the end-all-be-all nor absolutely meaningless. They mean something towards a player's career, but not everything. In terms of win shares, Kidd currently ranks 33rd in NBA history, which ranks seventh among point guards, behind John Stockton, Oscar Robertson, Chris Paul, Jerry West, Gary Payton, and Magic Johnson. In terms of BPM, he's 39th all-time, although he was higher on the list before the formula for BPM was changed this year. Currently, there are eight point guards ahead of him in this stat, but of the eight, five of them are active and their career BPM's will probably drop when they exit their prime. Most impressive is his VORP, which ranks 18th in history and is only surpassed by John Stockton, Chris Paul, and Magic Johnson among point guards. When all of these are considered, his advanced stats are indicative of a player who is around number 30 on the all-time list and number six or seven in terms of point guards.

# Playoffs

The other big counterargument towards Kidd's career was that he never won a championship in his prime. This may be true, but a championship is a team accomplishment, and most of the factors that go into winning a championship are not under an individual player's control. One of the biggest factors that goes into winning a championship that the player has no control over is their supporting cast. Jason Kidd didn't have a supporting cast. This is best referenced by the fact that the Nets went from being a 26 win team in 2001 without Kidd to being a 52 win team in 2002 with Kidd. Kidd carried this team to the NBA Finals twice. Yes, the Eastern Conference was weak during the time, but so was his supporting cast. The only meaningful teammates he had during those runs were Kenyon Martin in his second and third years, Richard Jefferson in his first two years, Keith Van Horn, and a post-ACL tear Kerry Kittles. They lost in the Finals both of those years, but they played the Shaq-Kobe Lakers in 2002 and the prime Duncan-Popovich Spurs in 2003, and very few teams in NBA history would've been able to beat either of them. A little bit later, he got some help in Vince Carter, but the Kidd-Carter duo did not experience much success. Why? Because other than Kidd, Carter, Jefferson, and maybe Nenad Krstic before the injury problems, those Nets had absolutely no talent.

Kidd finally had some team success when he got traded and won a championship with the 2011 Mavericks. A lot of people discredit Kidd for this title because he was past his prime, but I think he deserves more credit than he gets for two reasons. The first reason is that he was much more than just a role player. He led the Mavericks in minutes, assists, steals, and three pointers, and he placed third on the team in win shares. All said, he definitely wasn't at his peak, but he wasn't as washed as Gary Payton in 2006 or Tracy McGrady in 2013. The other reason is because the 2011 Mavericks made the greatest Finals run in NBA history. They were underdogs in three out of the four series they played in, they swept the reigning championship Lakers, they beat three future MVP's against the Thunder, and to cap it off they beat LeBron and the Big 3 Heat in the Finals. Kidd was instrumental in this run, shooting brilliantly, playing fantastic defense, and hitting some crucial shots throughout the run. I still don't think this championship is as valuable as a player in their prime winning a championship as the star of their team, but I do think it's more valuable than he gets credit for.

# Conclusion

If you factor in every aspect, there is no way you can say Jason Kidd didn't have a great NBA career. On my all-time list, Jason Kidd ranks 28th, although my ranking of him may be slightly biased due to the fact that I'm a Nets fan, but I don't think he deserves a ranking much lower than that. I originally said that most people would rank him somewhere in the 45-30 range, and while I certainly think 30 is not too high for him, I don't think 45 is high enough to fairly rank him. I believe that Kidd deserves to be in the 35-25 range, which makes him slightly underrated in my opinion, but it's not too much of a problem. I do think it's a problem, however, that he is never really discussed among the all time greats. Players like Allen Iverson, Reggie Miller, and Patrick Ewing are all considered all-time greats more often than Kidd is, even when Kidd is greater all-time than them, or at the very least on par with them. I also think Jason Kidd's ranking among point guards is a problem. I've already mentioned that Kidd is generally around number nine on people's all-time point guards lists, behind Magic, West, Curry, Stockton, Paul, Nash, Robertson, and Thomas. Of these players, I believe only Magic, West, and Curry have irrefutable cases to be greater all-time than him. I'd also rank Paul ahead of him due to his scoring, but I would place Kidd above the rest of them

* Stockton is the all time assist leader and averages more assists than Kidd, but due to having Karl Malone on his team, playing in an era where there were more assists per game than Kidd, and playing in a system that inflated his assist numbers, it was easier for Stockton to get his assists than Kidd and I would say Kidd is a slightly better passer than him. I also think Kidd is a better defender and rebounder than Stockton, although Stockton was a more efficient scorer than Kidd. Both have great advanced stats although Stockton's are slightly better. Both made the Finals twice in their prime and lost to amazing teams both times, and while Stockton faced better competition in the West than Kidd did in the East, Stockton also had better teammates than Kidd so that evens out, and Kidd has a championship to his name while Stockton doesn't, so overall, I'd say Kidd had a better career.
* Thomas scored in higher volume than Kidd although he was just as inefficient than him. Besides that, Kidd was the superior passer, defender, and rebounder, and Kidd's advanced stats beat Thomas' in a landslide. Thomas has two prime championships to his name, but his supporting cast was far greater than Kidd's, and while he faced greater competition in the East than Kidd, his competition has become overrated as the years go by, and the same goes for his competition in the Finals. Again, I'm choosing Kidd.
* Both Nash and Kidd were some of the greatest passers of all time, and I think the difference between the value of their passing abilities is negligible, but as an incredibly efficient scorer and accurate shooter, Nash was definitely a more impactful offensive player than Kidd. The difference, however, is that while Nash played very little defense, Kidd was an all-time elite defender and he was also a fantastic rebounder while Nash wasn't. Their advanced stats are pretty much equivalent. Nash never made the Finals in his career although it was incredibly tough to make it in the West at the time, but Nash did have a better supporting cast than Kidd. Their amount of playoff success during their primes considering the competition and supporting casts is about equal, but Kidd has the Mavs title over Nash. All said, I'm placing Kidd above Nash
* And I'm probably going to get a lot of backlash for Robertson, but this is the comparison is the one I feel the least strongly about. Robertson was clearly a better offensive player than Kidd and he is an all-time great rebounder similar to Kidd, but from what I can tell, Robertson wasn't much of a defender. Advanced stats largely didn't exist back then, so that can't really be compared. However, while Robertson was averaging those crazy stats, his teams were routinely missing the playoffs, and it wasn't until he joined Kareem that he won a championship, and by that point his numbers dropped severely. I would put Kidd above Robertson for now but if you would like to put Robertson ahead, then I'd have no problem with it whatsoever.

Everything put together, I think Jason Kidd is properly rated if not slightly underrated, although he is slept on far too often and his placement on the all-time point guard rankings is far too low.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,86873,public,self,Jason Kidd is slept on and underrated on the all-time list,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/gmca90/jason_kidd_is_slept_on_and_underrated_on_the/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,

This is my first time contributing content to this sub, let me know if you think there are interesting ways to further expand this research, or other ways to extrapolate from this data that I haven't included here.

I was looking at individual seasons with over 20 FGA (arbitrary number that indicates extreme FGA as only 1-8 players reach this per season) and over 50% FG%.

I found that in the last 40 years (I started with 80-81) 148 individual seasons with &gt;20FGA have been played by 49 individual players. 80/148 came before 2001, 68 came after 2001. Of those 148 seasons, **36** (24%) have also managed to achieve &gt;50% FG%. However, the distribution of those seasons is telling, with 31 coming before 2001, and only **five** seasons of &gt;20FGA and &gt;50%FG coming after 2001; the year that illegal defence rules were removed, and zone defence was introduced. 

This means that:

\- **39% (31/80) of players who shot over 20 FGA pre-2001 were able to do it with over 50% efficiency**

\- **7% (5/68) of players were able to achieve this after the introduction of zone defence**. 

What do you think about this data? I'm a relatively new basketball fan and would love to hear your input on how to interpret this data. I don't really have a pre-determined stance coming into this. I decided to look this up because of the /r/nba post talking about MJ averaging 34.5 ppg between 1986 and 1990, and I was curious how efficient he was, and how exceptional that efficiency may have been. However, this data or conversation isn't limited to MJ by any means, that was just the springboard that led me to collect this data.

Blake Griffin is a must-cut to me, same as Aldridge, Horford, and Batum. But what about other names such as Westbrook, Vucevic, or Barnes? It's a really interesting debate to have when it comes to some those players in terms of their value, levels production, and age combined.

Ages 35+: 79% Jordan, 21% LeBron
Ages under 35: 66% Jordan, 34% LeBron
Total: 73% Jordan, 27% LeBron

So it's clear that the vast majority of people think MJ is the GOAT. I personally think LeBron is, but have no problem in people thinking differently, there is much cause for debate on that. What I do have a problem with is people undermining LeBron's career now and saying there's a huge difference between him and Jordan, that Jordan is just on another level entirely and one guy even said that he should be compared to guys like Magic Johnson (no disrespect to Magic), because he has no right to be compared to the clear GOAT that is MJ. That pissed me off. 


So I thought about it and came to an understanding that a lot of people are influenced by Jordan's documentary now. The older people who watched him play are getting a nostalgia trip back to the 90s and the younger people who didn't watch him play are watching this documentary series about how great Jordan was. The one thing I hate when debating anything sports related is nostalgia. It's inevitable that it will play a factor in people's judgement, but some people just let it cloud their judgement entirely. Same with Kobe (may he rest in peace) . While he was playing people always seemed to compare him to LeBron and when he finally retired, people took a step back and a lot of them realised that he wasn't in the top 3 players of all time, but rather in that top 10 range. When he passed away, I saw a lot of people putting him back in the top 3 and some of them even have him over LeBron, which is crazy to me.


Now let's assume Jordan hadn't released a documentary, but LeBron had instead. It shifts all focus away from Jordan and on LeBron. It would show how LeBron took the 06-07 Cavs to the Finals without a nowhere near good enough supporting cast, how he was clearly the most dominant and most complete player in the league in his Miami days, how he overcame a 3-1 deficit to beat one of the best teams of all time, with the best regular season record of all time, the 15-16 Warriors and brought a championship to Cleveland in his first year back there, how he managed to lead another team that had no right to be in the Finals in the 17-18 Cavs to the 2018 Finals, with his second best player being a shell of his former self in Kevin Love and managed to score 51 in the first game of that series, against the best team of all time, and still end up losing etc. These moments would be more dramatized and you get players, coaches and journalists talking about LeBron's greatness and his influence on the game. The younger fans would eat it up and the older ones would develop more of an appreciation to LeBron than they had before. Hell, after the 2016 Finals I saw a lot of people calling him the GOAT just based off of that.


That's all I wanted to say. I think Jordan and LeBron aren't far off and you can make a case for both of them to be the GOAT. But, to think that Jordan is on a level on his own and uncomparable to LeBron just doesn't seem right and I think it's influenced a lot because of the narrative that this documentary presents.

I follow football, and we do not have similar thing as the NBA all star game. Wikipedia is also not helping me understand the value of this game to fans today. Apparently in the fifties there was not enough public attention to the League, so they created an exhibition game to rally the newspapers and fans to pay more attention to the sport. Which I can sort off understand, the brilliance of basketball is very visual and commentary on the radio would not be the same as it is for cricket or baseball. I am sure the all-star game also got newspapers to write columns about basketball rather than keeping it as a footer in the sport section. And fans could visit these games and see great players.

Here it goes!

Pheonix gets :

Andrew Wiggins +Eric Paschall +Looney+ Poole
Picks -  GSW-1st round (2020)+ Minnesotas 1st round (2021) +GSW- 1st round (2022) + Minnesota and Denver's 2nd Round (2021)

GSW gets:

Kelly Oubre + Ricky Rubio + Baynes

First let's address the easy part of this trade:

Why does Golden State do this? Oubre has gotten better each year since he was drafted, this year defensively he has been at his best. His efg% + 3% both career highs and very nice. His Ft% isn't a liability. 

Rubio! This is kinda brutal for him cause he's be coming off the bench to substitute Steph. But damn Rubio's play making,  his shooting have been great especially in the last two years.

BAYNES! He fits this team so well, he stretches, Baynes is great at setting screens and a perfect pick and pop candidate.

Why does Pheonix do this?

This is clearly not in Pheonix's best interest because Oubre, Baynes,  and Rubio have all been terrific this year.  But here's why they take the deal.

Wiggins whether he is efficient or not ( he's not) he's likely always going to be the other version of DeMar DeRozan.  He'll never take a team over the hump but he's certainly a good 2nd option and a great 3rd option. Additionally, Pheonix gets Eric Paschall and his promise.

Here's the real reason, the picks!  They at worst get the 5th pick in this draft at best get the first ( so first and ten in 2020)! Three first and two seconds isn't too shabby for taking on Wiggins.

Having won 6 out of 8 championships, and later still showing he can play very well on a Wizards team when he was 40 years old, the Bulls dynasty was given the option to defend their title until they lost it.  Obviously its hard to speculate about possible player rosters, fit, salary, etc., but assuming Krause kept the Bulls mostly intact with Phil, MJ, and Scottie at the helm, here are the actual real life roster moves that would have been impacted:

Jud Buechler, to Detroit Pistons 1999

Scott Burrell, to New Jersey Nets 1999

Ron Harper, to Los Angeles Lakers (part of Lakers championships in 2000 and 2001)

Steve Kerr, to San Antonio Spurs 1999 (part of Spurs championship in 1999)

Scottie Pippin, to Portland Trailblazers 1999

Dennis Rodman, to Los Angeles Lakers 1999

Phil Jackson/Tex Winter, to Los Angeles Lakers 2000 (part of Lakers championships in 2000, 2001, and 2002)

The breakup of the Bulls would contribute to championship teams for the next 4 years.  Assuming those players stay with the Bulls, the Spurs would have to replace Steve Kerr, and the Lakers would have to replace their entire championship coaching staff along with 2 years of Ron Harper.  Of those championship, the ones I remember most are of course from the Lakers, I remember Harper being very good and helped to mentor Derek Fisher, but I recall Fisher hit the big shots and Harper was more there to lead and calm the team down when things got out of hand.  Not to take anything away from Harper, but I think player-wise, the Lakers would have been fine with a different replacement.  Coaching is another thing though.

Out of the East, the Bulls would have had to face a lockout-shortened ECF champs of the Knicks lead by Patrick Ewing in 1999, a Pacers team with Reggie Miller the following year, a Sixers team with the MVP Allen Iverson, COTY Larry Brown, and DPOTY Dikembe Mutombo, and Sixth Man Aaron Mckie in 2001 (the only team to take a win off the 15-1 Lakers and they had to do it in overtime), and a back-to-back ECF winner in the New Jersey Nets lead by Jason Kidd in 2002 and 2003.  

Of course Father Time is unbeaten but the age in which he beats you varies with everyone.  How long could the Bulls have prolonged their championship dynasty?  

I think they would have had a serious threat to lose it the next year against the Spurs.  Of course winning 6 championships in 8 years is super impressive, but it took them 6 games to beat the Jazz and with the exception of Game 3, all the games were won by 5 or less points, that's something I don't think most people remember.  So the Bulls had to get very lucky to eke out their 4 wins against the Jazz, but the Spurs presented them with a different problem.  Their Twin Towers of Duncan and Robinson were going to feast on the center of the Bulls.  In 1999, Dennis Rodman was a shell of his former self, maybe he keeps most of his abilities under another year of harsh MJ guidance, but he only played 23 games for the Lakers when he signed with them that year.  The Bulls were always a guard dominated team, their center was never really that impressive.  I think the Spurs give all they can to the Bulls and it would be a very close series.

No matter how long MJ plays on though, i think he doesn't make it through the Shaq/Kobe teams without a loss.  Yes, Phil was absolutely integral to that team, but what's not mentioned is that Shaq was on a mission in 2000 to win.  That Lakers team went 67-15 in the regular season, I think its top 3 in Lakers all time regular season wins.  Shaq was MVP that year and as we all know, he was the only one to beat MJ during his dynasty run.  Yes, MJ only came back during the middle of the year, but Shaq still beat him.  Now this was MVP Shaq, most dominant ever, whatever MJ could have done against the Twin Towers the previous year, he would have had to face Shaq 3 times and I don't think he wins all 3.  Plus, you've got Kobe, the only guy who MJ said could beat him one-on-one (""cause he stole all my moves!"").  Kobe worships MJ and would likely rise to the challenge facing his idol in the Finals.  Kobe is just as ruthless at MJ was, remember he basically refused to let MJ win by blocking him towards the end of one of the All-Star games, I think he would definitely take his play up a notch.  

I do think MJ makes it out of the East at least in the next 2 years, he's long had Ewing and Miller's numbers.  But Iverson in 2001 I think would be too quick for MJ to handle.  I think a 40 year old MJ definitely would get tired trying to chase AI around the court.  Unless Krause finds a defensive stopper to guard him, and at that point nobody could guard AI, the Bulls team may not even make it to the Finals that year.  

By my count, MJ could have realistically won 1 or 2 more championships if the Bulls remained mostly intact, a possible one against the Spurs, and a less likely but still possible one against the Lakers depending how you feel about their replacement coach, but I think they'd be done by 2001 for sure.  Even MJ couldn't carry the Wizards to a winning record over his time playing with the team, and while he personally was very good, you couldn't win with MJ as your best player in the 2000's anymore.  Even if you assume MJ would be more likely to keep in shape had he not taken a few years off after his last title, it would have been more wear and tear on his knee which kept him out a lot during his Wizards tenure.  So hold your heads up high, Bulls fans, the title would likely have come to a halt the next year or two and MJ wouldn't be thought of as the invincible monster that his reputation has been built on.  Like it or not, Krause breaking up the team probably helped to cement MJ's legacy as never having lost in the Finals.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,86764,public,self,"If the Jordan Bulls never broke up, who would have eventually beaten them?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/glt0e4/if_the_jordan_bulls_never_broke_up_who_would_have/,some_ads,7,112a98bc-8b9a-11e8-9ae9-0e6672d65b8e,Team Discussion,,,,,,,,,

They were 20-47 before this break with Trae Young getting no help whatsoever. They're nowhere near as dominant as the 60 win 14-15 Hawks with an outstanding number of 4 All-Stars - Al Horford, Paul Millsap, Jeff Teague and Kyle Korver. What if I told you, that back in the 02-03 season there was an another Hawks team with 4 All-Star quality players, that wasn't even close to making the playoffs. Well, here's the story about that team.

So the Hawks just finished the 02-03 season and things weren't looking good for them. They selected Pau Gasol with the 3rd pick of the 2001 draft, only to trade him to Memphis for their star player, Shareef Abdur-Rahim. The trade looked good at the time with Abdur-Rahim making the 2002 All-Star Game, despite the Hawks having a 33-49 record and finishing as the 12th seed in the East. To make things worse, their All-Star rim protector, that they acquired from Philly in free agency, Theo Ratliff was out for the entire season with a hip injury. They knew they had to do something in the off-season, so they made a move to get Milwaukee's star forward Glenn Robinson in exchange for Toni Kukoč, Leon Smith and a first round pick. Robinson was a proven player, making the All-Star Game 2 times in the last 3 seasons, so with the addition of him to a team that already had Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Theo Ratliff and their up-and-coming star in Jason Terry, the team was bound to get over the hump and make the playoffs for the first time in 5 seasons. So what went wrong? Well, I'll go through everyone in the ""Big 4"" individually and then talk about the other factors that came into play in them having another terrible year, finishing as the 11th seed in the East.

**SHAREEF ABDUR-RAHIM**

**Stats for the season:** 19.9 PPG/8.4 RPG/3.0 APG/1.1 SPG/0.5 BPG/48 FG%/35 3P%/84 FT%/38.1 MPG

Shareef was selected 3rd overall in the star-studded 1996 draft. He played his entire career for the underachieving Vancouver Grizzlies, who, despite his best efforts, failed to make the playoffs in his 5 years there. He then got traded to the Hawks, where he made his first All-Star team in 2002.

Shareef played the most minutes a game on that team alongside Terry, being the second option on offense after Robinson. He was a good PF efficiency wise, having a 57 TS%. To make a comparison, he was in front of All-Stars Jermaine O'Neal, Shawn Marion and Stephon Marbury who had similar scoring numbers as his. He led the Hawks in PER with 19.9, being in front of All-Stars Peja Stojaković and Michael Jordan.

He was undoubtedly their best player this season. He led the team in Win Shares with 9.7, being top 20 in the league in that as well. His main weakness was his defense, but he wasn't even their worst defensive player that year. He absolutely exploded against the Knicks for 33 on 62% shooting, being 2-2 on threes that game and had a great game against the second seed Kings as well, scoring 32, but having a -7 plus minus, with Webber dropping 27. He used to absolutely live at the free throw line, being 11th in the league at free throws attempted and 8th at free throws made. He also both played and started 81 games that season.

To sum it up, ""Reef"", despite his flaws on defense, was undeniably the Hawks' best player that year.

Theo was in the league for 5 years before arriving at Atlanta, playing for both the Pistons and the 76ers, respectively. He broke out when he got to Philly, averaging over 11 PPG and 3 BPG in every of his three and a half seasons he spent there, as well as leading the league in blocks per game in the 2000-2001 season with 3.7 blocks, which led to him being selected as an All-Star for the first time in his career. He was brought to Atlanta the next year, but only appeared in 3 games for the Hawks his first season there because of a hip injury.

Offensively, he was bad. He averaged a 46 FG% on only 7.3 attempts a game, which for a center simply doesn't cut it. He was a good free throw shooter for a center, I'll give him that. He finished the season being top 10 in that area at his position. That would make his TS% to be a bit better at 51%. Despite his flaws offensively, the Hawks didn't need him for that. He was there to be their big, strong rim protector, so let's see how he did in that area.

Theo led the Hawks in Defensive Win Shares and he continued to be a beast at blocking shots too, he led the league once again alongside Ben Wallace with 3.2 BPG. He was the only player that had a positive Defensive Box Plus/Minus out of their whole entire starting lineup. His PER is not great, having the lowest one out of the ""Big 4"". He had a 20 point game in a loss to Toronto and flirted with 10 blocks in three games that season, coming up one block short. Theo, just like Shareef, played and started 81 games that season.

To sum it up, Ratliff was still an elite rim protector, but was terrible on offense.

**GLENN ROBINSON**

**Stats for the season:** 20.8 PPG/6.6 RPG/3.0 APG/1.3 SPG/0.4 BPG/43 FG%/34 3P%/88 FT%/37.6 MPG

The former first overall pick of the 1994 draft arrived at Atlanta after 8 solid years in Milwaukee. He made the playoffs three times in that span, almost going to the Finals in 2001 alongside Ray Allen, but getting eliminated by the 76ers in 7 games in the ECF. He made the All-Star Game two times, in 2000 and 2001.

Robinson was the most proven player out of the whole group. He made the ECF with one game keeping him out of the Finals, as the first option on that Bucks team. Like I mentioned before, he made 2 all star teams in a span of 3 years. He was literally the ""Big Dog"" among the team and was expected to lead them to the playoffs. In reality, he was beyond the shadow of a doubt the worst player of the Hawks' ""Big 4"".

So Glenn had the highest usage rate out of the entire team with 28.8%. He also had the worst TS% out of all the starters with the exception of Theo Ratliff and Dion Glover, when he was starting. On top of all that he had a 1.0 Offensive Win Share. Let that sink in. Glenn shared the second spot in the league with Paul Pierce in turnovers per game with 3.6, only 0.1 behind the leaders in Jason Kidd and Steve Francis. You want to know the difference between those 3 guys and Glenn? Francis averaged 6.2 APG, Kidd averaged 8.9, while Pierce averaged 4.4. The only player that's top 20 in TOPG that averaged less APG than Glenn was Darius Miles with 2.6 and he was 20th. Shaq even had more assists than him. He was 13th in total turnovers despite playing only 69 games that year. So on top of all of that offensively, an area where he's expected to strive and be the best on his team at, let's go over the defense.

He was one of the, if not the, worst defender on his team, having the worst DBPM rating out of all starters with a -1.5. He had an okay-ish 1.9 DWS rating, at least when compared to the rest of the team. His all around BPM was also the worst among the ""Big 4"". His best scoring games were 37 point, efficient double-doubles in wins against Seattle and Philly, and the Hawks won 9 in 13 games in which he wasn't playing. To add on, he had just a 0.8 VORP which was triple less than the teams' two best players in that stat, Terry and Shareef. He played 69 games that season, starting 68 of them.

To sum it up, ""Big Dog"" had a really bad season on both ends of the floor which was shown by the Hawks playing better without him.

**JASON TERRY**

**Stats for the season:** 17 PPG/7.4 APG/3.4 RPG/1.6 SPG/0.2 BPG/43 FG%/37 3P%/89 FT%/38.0 MPG

Terry was drafted by the Hawks with the 11th pick in the 1999 draft. ""The Jet"" broke out his sophomore season averaging 19.7 PPG on a horrible Hawks team. He finally got some help with Shareef last season and now this season with both Ratliff and Robinson.

Terry was the teams' second best player that season after Shareef. He continued to maintain his good play from last season, having the same TS% at 55% and a slightly less PER at 18.2. His points took a hit from adding Glenn Robinson to the mix, but he averaged 1.7 more assists per game to make up for it. He led the Hawks in both Offensive Box Plus/Minus and overall BPM, and was second in Win Shares. He was their third option on offense, behind Glenn and Shareef. 

His main problem, just like with Robinson, was turnover proneness. He came in at 14th in TOPG and 11th in total turnovers. His Assist/Turnover ratio was still miles better than Glen's though. Despite having the highest STL% of starters, he still wasn't a good defensive player (you noticing a common trend here?), with the -1.2 DBPM to show for it. He was comparable to players like Gilbert Arenas and Ricky Davis that season, DBPM wise. Jason's best games were a 33 point game in a win over Houston and a 31 point game, in which he made 6 for 7 threes vs Utah. He played and started 81 games that season.

To sum it up, ""The Jet"" continued his promising play on the offensive end, but still struggled with the defensive side of the ball.

**THE BENCH**

The final starter spot was debatable. Dion Glover started 42 games that year at shooting guard, averaging around 10 PPG, 4 RPG and 2 APG. He wasn't very efficient TS% wise. You also had Ira Newble, who started 45 games, averaging about 8 PPG and 4 RPG. Ira also had the best TS% on the team after ""Reef"" with 56% and was third in Offensive Win Shares. He was a decent player to have. Their bench wasn't nearly good nor deep enough as it should have been. Only Alan Henderson, Darvin Ham and Dan Dickau played over 50 games that season, with Darvin Ham being atrocious and Dickau being slightly less awful. Henderson was also a bad scorer for a center like Ratliff and was the only player to play 82 games that year. The rest of the bench consisted of a young, Nazr Mohammed, an old, bad Emanual Davis, a decent defender in Jermaine Jackson and the rest of the guys didn't play enough games to be worth a mention.

To sum it up, their bench wasn't good, didn't have a scorer off it and wasn't deep. It was a complete mess.

**COACHING**

So Lon Kruger was their coach for the past 2 awful seasons and was fired 27 games into the season with an 11-16 start. This was Krugers' first time coaching an NBA team, arriving from Illinois and he obviously wasn't cut out for it. He was an assistant coach for the Knicks the next season, before going back to college ball. 

Terry Stotts replaced Kruger as the head coach. This was also the first time Stotts was a head coach for an NBA team, being a long-time assistant in the league. Stotts managed to finish out the season with a 24-31 record. Stotts found success in the NBA eventually, as the head coach of the Trailblazers.

Both coaches were inexperienced and were first-timers at head coaching an NBA team, which certainly played a part in the Hawks finishing with a 35-47 record. 

**TEAM INFORMATION**

The Hawks finished 18th in the league at points per game and 21st in points allowed. They ranked 23rd in Offensive Rating and 22nd in Defensive Rating.

You would have expected them to be among the last teams in the league at points allowed, having had no good defenders outside of Ratliff, but you expected them to do better on offense. The team had three good scorers in Abdur-Rahim, Robinson and Terry and still wasn't in the top half of the league in that area. I guess not having a scorer off the bench played a part in that, alongside Robinson's bad season.

**CONCLUSION**

The team wasn't great by any standards, but with the quality they had on paper, they should have at least made the playoffs that year. Shareef was 26, Terry was 25 and Glenn and Theo were 29, they weren't old. Shareef, Glenn and Theo were all recent All-Stars, so presumably they were in their primes. You add in a young ""J.T."" who was improving each season and had the ability to drop 20 points a game and that should have been enough to make the playoffs in the weaker Eastern Conference, especially during the 2000s. 

The team suffered because of a horrible bench, lack of experience on coaching and Glenn Robinson not playing like his usual All-Star self. The Hawks were also a horrendous defensive team that season, despite having the league leader in blocks.

In conclusion, although not perfect, the team underachieved by finishing as the 11th seed, 7 games off of the 8th seed Magic. Despite having the quality on paper, they still managed to be that far off of the playoff picture, which shows just how much flawed this team actually was.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,86680,public,self,The 2002-03 Hawks - a complete failure of a really talented team,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/glfsdh/the_200203_hawks_a_complete_failure_of_a_really/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,

One example of this is nearly every person, who isn't a Bucks fan, constantly posting about how Giannis isn't returning to Milwaukee and how they're certain he's signing with Golden State. 

And a lot of those people aren't really assessing Golden State's situation for both, the present and the foreseeable future. Let's begin with their salary cap situation. It's bad, to say the least. They have virtually no cap space to add defense, depth, and shooting. In fact, they don't even have the cap space to sign Giannis to a lucrative contract so they'd have to trade either Green or Thompson along with Wiggins which leaves the team without their defensive anchor or their primary on-ball defender and secondary scoring option along with losing a solid 20 point scorer in Andrew Wiggins. 

Now correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't the whole idea of Giannis signing with Golden State exist mainly because of the possibility he could play with Curry, Green, and Thompson? And if they lose one of the latter two, then the team is severely compromised. Especially if they hypothetically trade Thompson given that they have virtually no cap room to add another quality scoring option and floor-spacer. Although they'd likely trade Green since Giannis would fill his defensive role much better since he'd be the better defensive player at that specific point in time. 

So I've expressed that they have no cap space to add any sort of depth and that they'd likely have to trade either Green or Thompson along with Wiggins just to make room for Giannis. But say by some miraculous way they do find a way to retain their core and still be able to sign Giannis, many people are forgetting that their core are far removed from their peaks as players. 

Curry, Green, and Thompson will all be over 31 years-old with injury history along with slowly declining. Curry in these past few seasons has been dealing with multiple ankle and hand injuries, has missed a fair amount of playoff games, and is coming off of missing nearly an entire season meaning he won't be in the same physical condition or have the same stamina he once did.

Meanwhile, Thompson is recovering from a ruptured ACL tear and likely hasn't even picked up a basketball in a nearly a year so it's likely he'll lose a step in terms of endurance and stamina given his brand of basketball relies mainly on cutting, switching directions on a die, and constantly being active off the ball. And not to mention that his brand of defense also relies on the things I listed in my previous point. 

As for Green, well, he has been rapidly declining as well as suffering from a few minor injuries here and there. His defense is what has suffered the most, his passing has grown quite careless and sloppy, his foot speed and lateral quickness isn't quite as good as it was in seasons past, he's also utterly atrocious as a scorer and provides the exact opposite of what a team would want to build around Giannis. The only reason he even stays in this hypothetical equation is because of how good a defense consisting of him and Giannis would be. 

And that's not even mentioning how these players have hade 5 consecutive finals appearances or how they've constantly made the playoffs for 7 consecutive seasons. To put it candidly, they're older, they're not quite as good as they once were, and they all might struggle with conditioning and  health in their later seasons. 

Simply put, they have no cap room to add depth or retain their core, and even if they were to retain their core they'd be far past their best days as players and would all likely struggle with health.

For depth, they'd have to rely on Chriss, Lee, Paschall, and Poole as well as whoever becomes their first round pick this season. And given that Lee and Poole are sadly not very good along with Chriss being wildly inconsistent, that is not the ideal bench you'd surround Giannis. And honestly, me mentioning that first round pick is redundant since it's likely they'd also trade that player. 

Honestly, people should worry more about Golden State's current situation instead of being hopeful that Giannis signs there. And I'm also quite sure that Giannis is also aware of this situation. 

**TL;DR: Golden State has no cap space to add depth, sign Giannis, and retain their core so it's likely either Green or Thompson get traded. Their core is also older, not as healthy, and aren't in the same shape due to multiple finals berths as well as some missing an entire season. Their current depth chart consists of awful young players with Paschall being the only quality young player.**",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,86656,public,self,Why signing Golden State isn't the best option for Giannis,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/glc2m5/why_signing_golden_state_isnt_the_best_option_for/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,

I got really excited when the pandemic forced an early release. But since it’s started and we’re near the finish line, I’ve been underwhelmed to put it perfectly. 

We were promised never before seen footage of the last Bulls championship season and a camera crew following that team around. What was left out of commercials and what the majority of the film is actually about is the history of Michael Jordan and the players that surrounded him. We were taken to multiple flashbacks of the 70s and 80s, with episodes talking about how Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, and Phil Jackson came to be. It’s downed Jerry Krause every chance it gets, and you really only get a one-sided perspective unless Reinsdorf is backing him up. 

The majority of episodes have been flashbacks that we’ve seen many times before (Dream Team, Jordan’s “shot”, Jordan’s performance against Boston, baseball, etc). And then you say, “well they’re trying to appeal to the non-basketball fan crowd too”, but you’re also not fulfilling the purpose of the documentary that’s also the title. They’ve skipped around the 1998 season so much because of the flashbacks, that we really don’t have that much more of an understanding than we already had. It’s Jordan being a competitive leader to teammates and that’s honestly it. 

And now tomorrow are the final two episodes. We really don’t have any great insight into that 1998 team because the majority of the documentary was detailing how players/coaches got to Chicago, and to me that’s disappointing. Sure you get all the players and people interviewed, but it’s modern and nothing special.  I expected ten episodes that showed the 98 squad behind the scenes, not detailing flashbacks. But instead we got an oral history of the Bulls and a documentary used to put MJ on a pedestal of his own. 

This show has gotten huge ratings and rave reviews, so my opinion is probably unpopular, but “The Last Dance” didn’t really set out what it was teased to do in my opinion. It wasn’t really about the Last Dance, as much as it was about the history of Michael Jordan and how he influenced his role guys.

There was a comment under the Zeke post that lumped Nash in with Magic and Curry and placed him OVER Isiah Thomas and AI. During the redraftables series by Bill Simmons Nash was picked 2-3 spots AHEAD of Iverson. This is out of hand.

The revisionist narratives around Steve Nash’s career are out of hand. I love Steve Nash’s game, his off balance floaters around the rim, his pace, his shooting, his creativity. Steve Nash is one of the greatest pg’s of all time but the way he’s talked about now doesn’t line up with his career.

Steve Nash was not, at any point in his career, better than Isaiah Thomas (or Allen Iverson). Magic and Curry were dominant players who left their imprint on every game they played and the game as a whole. Nash is one of the greats but he wasn’t even the best guard of his era. The only reason anyone puts his name in that air is because of the two MVPs (which he totally deserved when looking back over the stats and playoff success of other stars during that period). Stats nerds love of Nash is out of hand. 

Nash played more seasons than either of them (Zeke and AI) and has less All-Stars (“He WaS iN ThE WEsT” he also outlasted both of them by half a decade and the gap isn’t close), the same amount of All-NBA 1sts, fewer points, steals, and blocks than either of them (despite the extra years) and he’s less accomplished in the playoffs than either of them. 

I know this isn’t a Steve Nash post, but between y’all, Bill Simmons, and advanced stats guys this is out of pocket. Nash was an excellent shooter and played with an emphasis on pace and efficiency that was well ahead of his time. He never dominated games, especially in crunch time like Zeke or AI, he was miles behind defensively and his reputation among players never justified this revisionist view of his career.

Look at All Star games, the games where the best basketball players in the world are going head to head. Nash was never that guy on that stage. AI and Zeke dominated...Nash only *started* twice...He also never scored in double figures.

Steve Nash is an all time great basketball player whose style paved the way for modern NBA offenses, but he was never in the class of Magic/Curry/Zeke and no one actually watching basketball during the 00’s was taking Nash over AI.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,86559,public,self,Steve Nash is Overrated,0,[],0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/gkvgtv/steve_nash_is_overrated/,some_ads,7,099e778a-8b9a-11e8-b53d-0eebf66bed8a,Player Discussion,,,,,,,,,

ESPN had him just barely in at 9. But, I disagree. A player with his resume shouldn't even be considered out of the top 10. I believe he has a case over anyone but Jordan himself. I know this is going to get downvoted into oblivion, but at least hear me out.

Kobe is arguably the greatest scorer of all time, and at the very minimum, top 3. Adjusted for pace, his 2006 season is the 3rd highest scoring season ever. His 5 year peak is also the 3rd highest ever. Going away from the statistics, he is widely considered the most skilled and clutch player ever. Obviously, these two aspects of his game are intangible and can't be measured, but it should definitely be considered. 

His overall resume is challenged by so few players, I can count them on one hand. No other player, except for Kareem has as many combined defensive and offensive accolades. He has the 2nd most all stars ever, tied for 1st in all NBA teams, 2nd in all defensive teams, 1st in all star MVPs. 5 championships, 1 MVP(imo it should be more), 2 FMVP, was the greatest player for an entire DECADE. If it weren't for his rape case and negative perception by the media, he would definitely have won more than 1 MVP. Similar to Lebron after 'The Decision', when he should've won it over DRose.

Much of the disrespect towards him come from two things, that he was carried by Shaq during the 3-peat , and that he was inefficient and a ball hog. While Shaq was better in the finals, arguments could be made that in the some of the overall playoffs, Kobe was the better player. In 2001, Kobe outscored Shaq in the 2 most vital series, against the Spurs and Kings, where he had one of the greatest moments in playoff history, scoring 48 and grabbing 16 boards. They had identical WS/48, Kobe had better VORP, and Shaq and had the better BPM. Throughout, the 3-peat Kobe constantly showed up when Shaq didn't, such as against the Spurs, whom he consistently shredded through the peat and the rest of his career. Shaq might have been the better player, but he would barely make out of the 1st round without Kobe.

Kobe is also considered inefficient, and although he wasn't one of the most efficient player ever, he is actually  much more efficient than average. Throughout his career, he is +4.4 relative true shooting, and has never dipped below the average true shooting, except for his last 3 years when he was injured.

I feel like Kobe's last few years ruined a lot of our perceptions of him as a player and made many people forget how good he actually was.

It seems like everyone is saying that Thomas is slept on, underrated, and just an amazing basketball talent. While I agree with the last point, I disagree with the first two. See, people have told me they think Thomas is underrated, to which I ask them where they believe Thomas should be ranked, and almost every time, they say somewhere in the 30's or late 20's all time. Here's some news: Pretty much everyone has Thomas somewhere from 25-40 on their all-time list, meaning that if you think Thomas is underrated, you would have to think he's top 25 all-time, and I don't think you can make a sound argument to support putting him in your top 25 all-time list.

An argument that I've seen more and more frequently is about his scoring, in that ""if he wanted to, he could've scored much more than 19 points per game."" Hard disagree. Thomas was, in a word, inefficient. He shot 45% from the field, which doesn't seem too bad, but he was a 29% 3 point shooter and a poor free throw shooter for a point guard. True shooting is a much more effective measure of a player's efficiency, and Thomas' TS% was 51.6%. In case you don't know, that's real bad. Let's put that into perspective. The league average TS% from the 1982 season until the 1994 season was 53.7%, meaning that Thomas shot 2.1% below league-average. Another player who is considered inefficient (for good reason) is Jason Kidd. The league average TS% from 1995 to 2013 was 53.1%, and Jason Kidd's 50.7% TS was 2.4% below league-average. So Thomas scored 19 points per game, which is good, but it was on Jason Kidd level efficiency. Sure, he could've decided to score more and pass less if he wanted to, but in that case, he would've been considered a small, inefficient scorer, and therefore would've been played less, so he wouldn't have enough time to score more than 19 a game.

Thomas was obviously a great passer, and while I don't particularly see people overrating his passing ability, it should be said that he's not without his flaws. He averaged a career 9.3 assists per game, which is like, really good. However, he also averaged 3.8 turnovers. The only players who have more turnovers per game than him in their career are Magic Johnson, Russell Westbrook, and John Wall. You could say his high turnover numbers are due to his high assist numbers, but his assist to turnover ratio is not great, at just 2.46. This mark is significantly lower than the A/TO of game's greatest passers, such as Magic Johnson (2.89), John Stockton (3.72), Jason Kidd (3.02), Steve Nash (2.97), and Chris Paul (3.94). You also have to watch some of the film if you want to make valid statements about players, and that I did. I didn't really notice him making advanced or creative passes as often as the aforementioned passing greats, and a lot of his assists were more a product of his outstanding teammates than his own passing. Overall, I'd still categorize Isiah Thomas as a great passer, but he's not on the same tier as players like Magic, Nash, Kidd, and CP3.

Thomas' defensive ability is also something I don't really hear being talked about that often, but I should at least share my thoughts about his defense. I'm not really sure what the public opinion on Thomas' defense is, but I do know that one of my friends (HUGE Pistons fan) believes that Thomas was an all-time great defender. I would guess that the majority of people think his defense is greater than it actually was. Casuals would point out his 1.9 steals per game and say that he was a very good defender, but us real fans know that defense goes way beyond just steals. I don't think advanced stats are the end-all-be-all to determine how good a defender is, but Thomas' advanced defensive stats were pedestrian. He finished his career with 39.5 DWS in 13 season which rounds out to just over 3 per season, which is decent but not great. his career DBPM is 0.2, meaning that he is just barely above average according to that stat, and his career defensive rating sits at 107, which is probably the least effective advanced defensive stat, but altogether, his advanced stats pit Thomas as an average if not slightly above average defender. If he was truly an elite defender, he probably should've made at least one all-defensive team during his career, right? Well, he didn't. Additionally, I watched some film, specifically focusing on his defense, and while he certainly give adequate effort on defense and was quick enough to keep up with pretty much everyone, his defensive IQ was suspect and he was far too small to match up with most players outside the point guard position. With everything in mind, I would call Isiah Thomas a slightly above average defender at best.

Thomas has a reputation for being a fantastically clutch player and a great leader, and this is the only reputation of his that I can't really argue with. I mean, there was the time he pulled a reverse Chris Webber, ignoring his coach's frantic calls for a timeout so that he could inbound the ball to Larry Bird for the win, who if you don't already know, was on the other team. That does leave a stain on his legacy, but overall, he was great in the clutch and he deserves credit for that. And there is not much you can say about Isiah Thomas being a leader. He was the leader of the Bad Boys, a team known for their toughness and erratic behavior on the court, but he was able to make sure that most of the players remained on the team and there weren't too many internal issues in the locker room or off the court that we know of. Sure, players on other teams didn't like him, but his teammates did, and that's really what matters. Of all the players in NBA history, Thomas was one of the best in the clutch and one of the best leaders. Of course, that's not the only thing that matters in an NBA career, but if you're going to praise Isiah Thomas for something, praise him for that.

There's one thing that people who praise Thomas never talk about, which is his advanced stats, and there's good reason behind it. Talking about Thomas' advanced stats inherently lower the greatness of Thomas' career, which is the opposite of what Isiah Thomas-praisers are trying to accomplish. The most common advanced stat used by NBA fans is probably win shares, and Thomas finished his career with 80.7 of them. For reference, that's 154th in NBA history, behind players such as Kevin Love, Joe Johnson, Richard Jefferson, and Steve Smith. Nothing against those guys, but Thomas is unanimously considered greater than them. He posted a WS/48 of .109 throughout his career, which doesn't even break the top 250 in NBA history, and theoretically, the average WS/48 is .100 (5 players on the court at a time, .100\*5=.500, and a team getting .500 WS/48 theoretically means they win half their games), so according to this stat, Thomas is barely an above average player. His career BPM is 2.6, which ranks 84th all time, behind players like Al Horford and Maurice Cheeks. An average BPM is 0.0, so Thomas is definitely above average in this stat, but +2.6 is not top 40-25 status. Finally, he has a career VORP of 41.6, which is a respectable 51st all time, but even then, his rank in VORP is clearly below his career all-time ranking according to most people. Advanced stats aren't everything, but it's not like they exist for no reason and are completely useless. I don't think Thomas is as low on the all-time list as his advanced stats indicate, but his advanced stats suggest that maybe he wasn't really all as effective as we all thought he was.

The most common thing that people who say that Isiah Thomas is underrated highlight is what he did in the playoffs. In terms of an individual standpoint, this is warranted. Thomas increased both his volume and efficiency, pretty much across the board in the playoffs. Additionally, his advanced stats are much improved in the playoffs as opposed to the regular season. However, what I think is overstated is the difficulty of Thomas' playoff runs. People mention the fact that Thomas beat Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Michael Jordan in the playoffs as if he's some kind of assassin that dominates legendary players and teams and sends them home packing. This simply isn't true. First of all, his supporting cast was legendary. He consistently played with 4 Hall-of-Fame or all-star level players in Joe Dumars, Dennis Rodman, Bill Laimbeer, and Adrian Dantley/Mark Aguirre. There was also John Salley, Rick Mahorn, and Vinnie ""The Microwave"" Johnson off the bench and a twice-over Hall-of-Fame coach Chuck Daly to support these players. On top of that, it's important to consider that all these players played together on the same team for quite a while, and they had one of the strongest identities of any basketball team in history. All said, the Bad Boy Pistons were a legendary team, and Thomas just happened to be the leader of that team.

Either way, all of the teams Thomas is credited for beating were not nearly at their peak. Thomas and the Pistons beat Larry Bird and the Celtics in 1988 and 1989, and at that time, Bird, McHale, Parish, and Dennis Johnson were all in their thirties. They won 57 games in 1988, so it was still an accomplishment to beat them then, but in 1989, they only won in 42 games and Bird missed the whole season. And to add to that, the Celtics beat the Pistons in 1985 and 1987, so at best, the Pistons' record against the Celtics was 2 for 4. Thomas also gets a ton of credit for him and the Bad Boys beating the Showtime Lakers in 1989. In this series, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was 41, and averaging just 10 points per game. Furthermore, Pat Riley notoriously overworked this team leading up to the Finals, so they were exhausted during the season. Finally, the Lakers beat the Pistons the year prior, so at best, the Pistons are 1 and 1 against the Lakers. The last team is Jordan's Bulls, and unlike the Lakers and Celtics, the Pistons did actually beat them more times than the Bulls beat the Pistons. However, the first two times, the Bulls didn't have Phil Jackson as their head coach, and the last time, Phil Jackson was a rookie coach. To add to this, these Bulls teams were incredibly young, as neither Jordan, Pippen, nor Horace Grant were above the age of 26 in any of these series.  When the Bulls were experienced enough and truly ready to contend, they swept the Pistons. So yes, Thomas technically beat Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Michael Jordan, but Thomas' supporting cast was nothing short of perfection and none of these players' teams were at the top of their games.

I don't see how you can call Isiah Thomas underrated if you know all of this information. He was certainly an all-time great, and there's no debating that, but if you're putting him any higher than 25th all-time, you're probably forgetting a few things about his career. Personally, I have him 35th on my all-time list, although I would have no problem with someone putting him as high as 25th or as low as 40th. He's 9th on my list of all-time point guards, behind Magic Johnson, Jerry West, Stephen Curry, Chris Paul, Jason Kidd, Oscar Robertson, Steve Nash, and Walt Frazier, who everyone seems to overlook when making all-time rankings.

tl;dr: Isiah Thomas was an all-time great, especially in terms of his playmaking, clutch, and leadership, but due to the fact that people overlook his inefficient scoring, average defense, poor advanced stats, ridiculously good supporting cast, and overrated competition, he is often labeled ""underrated"" when he is in fact properly rated.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,86515,public,self,Isiah Thomas is not underrated.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/gkn0ym/isiah_thomas_is_not_underrated/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,

Right now the Knicks are projected to pick 6th and 27th. While the Knicks need a lot, i'll focus on the biggest needs which are scoring from the guard position and 3 point shooting. Assuming they'll still be picking 6th i'd assume LaMelo, Edwards, Deni, Hayes, and maybe Toppin or Okongwu will be taken. 

The best available picks for them at this point assuming those above are gone would be Tyrese Haliburton, Cole Anthony, Devin Vassell, and Issac Okoro. I think Cole Anthony would be the best pick here. While his efficiency sucked ass in college, i think many people give him a small break due to the spacing that team had. I think he has the highest scoring potential out of the 4 mentioned and while he may not be a super star player, i think he'll be able to be a good player with NBA spacing. Some may like Haliburton at this pick due to his great shooting and passing, i wouldn't argue anyone who would take him over Cole, but i think he's more like Lonzo Ball in the sense that hes a smart passer and a good shooter (Lonzo has been pretty good this year) but has limited offensive ability due to shooting mechanics. Knicks need scoring badly, i think Cole has a better chance at giving them that.

Quick notes about Vassell, Issac, and Kira. Vassell seems to be a high floor low ceiling guy, i'd take him if we drop to pick 9. Issac Okoro is someone with a high ceiling with legit star potential but i dont see him developing into that player with the Knicks. They haven't proven they can develop a more raw player, it seems like they need someone with a solid foundation first. I wouldnt be upset with them reaching or trading back for Kira Lewis Jr. I think he has a bit of DeAaron Fox in him and i believe in his potential. 

As for the 27th pick, there's a lot more variance here since this draft is all over the place. I like Jalen Smith here. He runs the floor well, can block shots, has shown improved 3 point shooting. He seems like someone who can play some stretch 4 or be a solid back up 5. Mitchell Robinson is the future center here, but he hasn't shown any shooting ability. It would be great to have a stretch big to play in certain lineups. 

**TL;DR: Knicks take Cole Anthony, wouldn't be mad if they take Kira Lewis Jr. Knicks take Jalen Smith 27th**

**Free Agency (Player/Team Options)**

**We don't know how much the cap will be reduced, so lets just say the cap gets reduced to 100 Million** 

Assuming all team options are declined, partially guaranteed contracts are waived, and joakim noah's contract, the Knicks have roughly 55 million in guaranteed contracts. I'll add in an extra 8 million to this to account for their draft picks. **So hypothetically the Knicks would have around 64 Million Guaranteed contracts, 36 Million in free cap space**

Knicks current expiring contracts are

Bobby Portis - Team Option (15 million)

Taj Gibson - Team Option (10 million)

Elfrid Payton - Partially Guaranteed (8 Million, Guaranteed 1 Million)

Wayne Ellington - Team Option (8 Million)

Reggie Bullock - Partially Guaranteed (4.2 Million, Guaranteed 1 Million)

Mo Harkless - UFA

Damyean Dotson - RFA

Allonzo Trier - RFA

Who would i keep, who would i let go? 

Portis isn't terrible but he makes way too much to justify accepting that team option, declined. 

Taj makes 10 million, a bit much but he's been super valuable when Mitchell Robinson gets into foul trouble. He's also been a positive in the locker room, but he's pretty old and theres not enough cap space. If there wasn't a reduction in the cap i'd keep him 100% but with him taking 10 million, that can be better used. Plus in this scenario the Knicks just drafted Jalen Smith, play him at the back up 5. 

Payton. Declined, tired of his ball hogging. 

Wayne Ellington. He's a good vet but has been really bad with us. Declined but i hope he bounces back on another team.

Bullock. Accept. So much value from him with that small 4.2 million dollar contract. A good fall back option as  well in case we cant/dont keep Dotson or Trier

Harkless. I'd give him a 3/33 contract. He isn't an amazing shooter but hes a plus defender. Plays his role well and isnt high usage. Also Ignas and Knox arent really NBA starters yet, he'd be a good bridge player. 

Dotson - I want to keep him, super consistent player. Plays defense, can shoot, is basically the SG version of Harkless. Very valuable, i'd throw him 3/27

Trier. This is a wait and see. Dude can score at all 3 levels but doesnt play any defense and doesnt pass the ball. Also some reports about some players not liking his attitude and ball hogging tendancies. I'd match his contract if its a good value but i'll let him test FA. 

**TL;DR. No more Portis, Payton, Ellington, Trier, and Taj. Keep Harkless, Dotson, Bullock. Guaranteed Contracts: 88 Million, Cap Space: 12 Million.**

**Free Agency (Open Market)**

With 12 million dollars in cap space left theres not much we can do with that. I think we also have an MLE to use as well. When looking at the team so far you'll see some needs

PG: Cole Anthony/Frank Ntilikina/Dennis Smith Jr

SG: RJ Barrett/Damyean Dotson/Reggie Bullock

SF: Mo Harkless/Kevin Knox/ Ignas B.

PF: Julius Randle

C: Mitchell Robinson/Jalen Smith

We still need more 3 point shooting, and another PF/Big

This is where i'd take a look at Christian Wood and Jerami Grant. Its unsure if  Grant would decline his 9 million dollar player option this year due to the cap dropping but if he does he'd be the first priority. He is a great defender, has shot 39 and 40% from 3 the past 2 years on respectable volume and has been scoring in double digits. Christian Wood has also shown great improvement in shooting/scoring but isnt the defender that Grant is. If i'm the Knicks i prioritize Grant mainly due to his defense being so much better than Wood. I'd throw him 3/36.

With our MLE i'd consider giving it to Taj Gibson again, With Mitchell Robinson being foul prone and Jalen Smith being a rookie, having a vet you can trust down there is important when they are having off games. Honorable mention to Carmelo Anthony in this spot as well. 

**TL;DR Knicks sign Jerami Grant and Taj Gibson**

Overall i think this would be an ideal summer for the Knicks. We stay pretty  young while addressing some issue we have regarding scoring and 3 point shooting. Ideally Julius Randle and DSJ are traded but i couldnt think of any teams who  would take Julius Randle outside of maybe the Mavs and also OKC in a CP3 trade.

Im open to any questions, comments, constructive criticism, etc. 

**Final TL;DR**

**Knicks final roster going into the 2020 - 21 season looks like this**

**PG: Cole Anthony/Frank Ntilikina/Dennis Smith Jr**

**SG: RJ Barrett/Damyean Dotson/Reggie Bullock**

**SF: Mo Harkless/Kevin Knox/ Ignas B.**

**PF: Julius Randle/Jerami Grant**

what are your thoughts on the matchup? playstyles? shooting? offense and defense? the top team has two dpoys and the bottom team only one at the C position. 

The bottom team has the size advantage, especially at the pointguard position and small forward position. But can the scoring of a trio of steph, klay, and Mj be stifled?

Hey everyone - on the final weekend before the COVID-19 shutdown, I noticed that LeBron showcased a new, very effective wrinkle on two right-handed drives - one vs the Bucks on 3/9 and one vs the Clippers on 3/11 - so I detailed that new technique. Thanks to the mods for letting me post.

 Here’s a table of contents:

\- 0:00 Intro

\- 0:51 LeBron’s gather technique

\- 2:30 Side by side comparison

For those at work or the hard of hearing, I've transcribed subtitles on YouTube so sound isn't required.

Summary (will do my best without visuals): LeBron's been very effective from the post in the 2019-20 season, averaging 1.163 PPP according to Synergy data which places him in the 93rd percentile, using a variety of moves in combination with his elite anticipation and passing skill to get himself and teammates great looks. He showcased another wrinkle to that offensive repertoire against the Bucks and Clippers on 3/9 and 3/11 respectively when he utilized a different gather technique on two specific plays - one vs Giannis and one vs Kawhi. Typically, when LeBron is attacking the middle of the paint off the left block, he utilizes a heavy torso lean and tight gather to attack the rim in a compact sequence. However, on these two possessions he attacked the middle of the paint with the ball held out away from his body and his torso vertical, allowing him more time to read the situation while biasing towards a wider drive angle across the paint, it's almost as if he's hesitating before committing (hence the ""hesitation gather""). This accomplished three key things - For one, it allowed him to get across the face of the defender before starting his two-step (in the video I point out that LeBron is nearly level to Giannis' and Kawhi's inside leg before even starting his two-step), for two the defense can't commit to plugging up the rim because LeBron hasn't shown himself yet, and third, it disrupts the timing/anticipation of the defense. In the video, I start by showing his typical gather, his hesitation gather on the Giannis' play, and then a side by side comparison of his normal gather and his hesitation gather vs Kawhi.

Lebron had terrible teams around him until he went to Miami and they still weren't a perfect compliment to his skill sets... So, with some help, I was hoping we could assemble a Lebron led team (or 2 teams one resembling the first 3 peat and the second 3 peat) that would be equivalent talent wise to Jordan's bulls... Couple notes: I am taking players from that generation and replacing them with more contemporary players. Obviously there's more of an emphasis on shooting now so I loosely pairing people based on talent but trying to think how teammates complimented Jordon and trying to find players who were around the same talent level and seeing how they would compliment Bron.... I am open to new suggestions.

Start with Scottie -- DPOY, great passer, the perfect number two for Jordan... Who would that be for Lebron? I was looking on the greatest players of all time ([https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/29105681/ranking-top-74-nba-players-all-nos-40-11](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29105681/ranking-top-74-nba-players-all-nos-40-11)) and number 21 was Pippen and 20 was Garnett... Garnett was an incredible defender, great shooter, great team player/teammate.. Garnett would the PERFECT number 2 to Lebron. So let's imagine if Lebron's prime years and Garnetts prime years overlapped precisely (like Jordan's and Pippens)... Open to other ideas if Garnett isn't perfect.

**First Three Peat --**

Pippen ----&gt; Garnett

Horrace Grant (Prime) ---&gt; Shawn Marion (IDK)

John Paxton ---&gt; Kyle Korver or JJ Reddick? (IDK)

BJ Armstrong ---&gt; Patrick Beverly or Mike Conley? (IDK)

Bill Cartwright ---&gt; Clint Cappella (I have no clue)

**Second Three Peat --**

Pippen ----&gt; Garnett

Dennis Rodman -- Draymond Green?

Stever Kerr -- Kyle Korver or JJ Reddick?

Toni Kukoc -- Manu?

Luc Longley -- No Clue

So now I am trying to imagine Lebron getting to play with this cast and crew of players. Lebron, Garnett pick and roll would be insane, with even just 2 shooters around him would be unstoppable. And on defense they would be insane, long and switchable.

Ok, so with the MJ documentary coming out, this has been more of a hot topic than ever.  I am a great fan of both and admire their greatness heavily and I am neither an over-the-top Bronsexual or a super Jordan fan. 

We'll start off with the **basic** statistics comparison of both players. Statistics don't tell the full story, however they are very important factors into telling these two apart. 

Michael Jordan Career Averages: 

30.1 ppg, 6.2 rpg, 5.3 apg, 2.3 spg, 0.8 bpg, 2.7 tpg on 49.7 FG% (51.0 2P%, 32.7 3P%), a free throw percentage of 83.5% and an effective field goal percentage (adjusts the fact the a 3PFG is worth one more than 2PFG) of 50.9% in **1072** games. 

LeBron James Career Averages: 

27.1 ppg, 7.4 rpg,  7.4 apg, 1.6 spg, 0.8 bpg, 3.5 tpg on 50.4 FG% (54.9 2P%, 34.4 3P%), a free throw percentage of 73.5% and an effective field goal percentage of 54.2% in **1258** games. 

Okay, so we all know that Michael Jordan and LeBron James are both one of the greatest scorers of all time period, however comparing their overall skill sets, Jordan takes the scoring bout with good reason. LeBron is two inches taller than Jordan and 55 pounds heavier and uses primarily his overall size and strength to muscle his way into dunks/layups in the **paint** to score (as proved in LeBron's shot chart over his career ([https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ei1330/oc\_shot\_chart\_of\_all\_shots\_made\_by\_lebron\_james/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ei1330/oc_shot_chart_of_all_shots_made_by_lebron_james/)) and has a sizeable amount of shots made in the mid-range and three-point area. 
Jordan's shot chart is primarily around the mid-range area and inside the key, and more frequently in the three point area despite popular belief. 

Although, there is nothing wrong with using strength and size to score in a basketball game and it is a feature that LeBron has over pretty much every player he plays against and uses it beautifully, Jordan's versatility to score from inside the paint and the outside at a more prominent rate is more valuable in a scorer. Jordan is more elite in various scoring areas compared to LeBron, even though LeBron's slashing ability might overshadow any component. 

Obviously, both of these players aren't knockdown three point shooters, but have proven to be players that can make a three point shot when needed and, when hot, can light it up from beyond as well. Their three point shooting percentages are very similar, with LeBron taking the edge with a 1.7% difference, which is barely noticeable in game. LeBron's free throw percentage is exactly 10% lower than Jordan's. 

Although I don't like it when LeBron haters bring up this topic too much, we have to acknowledge LeBron's free throw mishaps over the last two seasons especially. It is not the complete end of the world but free throws are very important and can quietly change an outcome of a game and it is just a fault we have to acknowledge. Jordan, in my opinion, is the greatest scorer of all time due to the fact the some players might have better physical attributes such as height or length, no one put the ball in the basket as much as Jordan (30.1 ppg for his career).

In my opinion, LeBron is the greatest all-around basketball player of all time and is a better overall rebounder and a much better passer/playmaker than MJ. Not to say Jordan lacks in those areas, as he definitely holds his own. 

A lot of people say Jordan is not a playmaker but it is simply not true statistically. In the 1988-89 season, coach Doug Collins decided to experiment putting Jordan at point guard for remainder half of the season as he did not believe in the other options on the team (Sam Vincent and John Paxson) at the starting PG position. Jordan went on to finish with an average of 8 assists a game and 28 games with 10 assists or above and 10+ with 9 assists. 

Although Jordan does not come close to LeBron's playmaking skills, he can definitely dish out and facilitate the offence **when needed to.** LeBron has proved to be one of the best facilitators of all time and has definitely showed for this season with an average 10.6 assists a game in 60 games (Corona fucked it) which is an unbelievable feat. 

Now this is a hard one. Who is the better defender? Obviously, LeBron has the size advantage and in my opinion, in his prime years with Miami and younger years with Cleveland, his defence would definitely have topped Jordan's due to his pure strength, speed and lateral quickness. But, his defence leading onto his later Cleveland and Laker years, it has been subpar to be quite frank. Jordan, even into his late 30's, was playing elite defence and continued making All-Defensive first teams until when he was near the age of 36. 

Now, let’s move away from statistics and move on to the accolades. LeBron James, the majority of the time, have had better teams in the finals compared to Michael Jordan and it's just pure facts. LeBron has been to the Finals nine times and has a worse team only four times compared to Jordan (in 2007, 2015, 2017, 2018) in which he all lost, which was more expected than not. 

Every other year though, LeBron has had more superstar talent and depth on the bench, statistically. Jordan's teams in his finals runs are very misinterpreted as a ""superteam"". Since when was a team with two superstars ever a ""superteam""? Since when was a team with only three 10+ point scorers in majority of all Finals runs ever a ""superteam""? Dennis Rodman joined the team in 1995-96 at the age of 34. He was obviously still a defensive juggernaut but his offensive game was subpar, at best. People only assume Jordan's teams were a""superteam"" because they performed so well, but they obviously weren't and that just credits to Jordan's greatness, with the obvious help from Scottie Pippen. 

The teams Jordan faced obviously had less starpower compared to him and Pippen, but the teams had much greater depth, majority having 5-6 double digit scorers on their rosters, with a superstar or two, yet no-one could overcome the Bulls, even though the rosters were quite similar. (You can fact-check all of this on basketballreference). 

Whereas LeBron has had the likes of Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, all players who were capable of scoring 20+ on their own team and being the cornerstone of a franchise. Only Pippen showed glimpses of that superstardom on Jordan's rosters. 

LeBron performed, in my opinion, the greatest Finals victory of all time in 2016, overcoming all odds and defeating the 73-9 Warriors team, averaging 29.7ppg, 11.3 rpg, 8.9 apg, 2.6spg and 2.3 bpg. I do understand where LeBron fans are coming from. That performance is undoubtably tremendous. But LeBron has disadvantages to his career achievements, which is unfortunate. 2011 series against Dallas is inexcusable, averaging 17.8ppg, 7.2 rpg, 6.8 apg, 1.7 spg, 0.5 bpg and 4 turnovers a game and the series loss. The numbers isn't that horrible, but from a player like LeBron James, everyone knows that is not his usual performances and his roster was definitely better than the 2011 Mavericks. If he can beat the 73-9 Warriors at the age of 31, I find hard to believe that he could not beat the 2011 Mavericks with one superstar at the age of 26. 

A lot of LeBron fans have said you can't blame LeBron for the 2014 Finals loss as he performed extremely well, it was his supporting cast that lost him the series. Well then, you cannot bring up the ""Jordan is 1-9 without Pippen in the playoffs"" argument as first of all, it was his first three seasons and he averaged 35.5 ppg, 6.3 rpg, 6.9 apg, 2.4 spg and 1.5 bpg in those 10 games. He performed exceptionally, it was his supporting cast that let him down and yet, Bronsexuals still bring this up, yet won't blame LeBron for any of his series' losses, due to him having no help which is pure bias and hypocritical at best. Jordan has always been the best player in a series, including both teams, and LeBron just cannot say that. 

LeBron is not the best player of all time just yet as his career is not yet over. I do believe if LeBron wins at least an additional championship, he might very well be the GOAT, due to the circumstances that he is in. But, as of now, LeBron does not have the accolades to match his superb skill level. Bronsexuals say if rings matter, ""Bill Russell should be the GOAT"" as he has 11 but his play level does not match his accolades compared to the likes of Jordan, Bron, Kobe, Kareem etc. Please feel free to argue and debate this down below, be sure to reply.",False,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,86371,public,self,"Michael Jordan is still the GOAT compared to LeBron James, but Bron is not far off.",0,[],0.33,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/gjyqh4/michael_jordan_is_still_the_goat_compared_to/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,

It is so hard being a fan of the knicks sometimes. I’m never going to leave, NYC/loyalty/Stockholm syndrome. But just thinking about The moves we made this off-season has me angry. The fact that I genuinely believe that I would have made better decisions than our front office last year is absolutely crazy and not just fan talk. Completely failed with team construction this year and that is not an exaggeration.

##What was the goal of our team for the 2019-2020 season?

**Make the playoffs?** Absolute joke

**Sign trade assets to trade for value for long-term moves?** Would have have been nice to actually trade those assets and after the deadline have are young players play. 

**Try to improve on what we have and be competitive?** I think that was the goal? Would’ve been nice if the young players got some minutes, at the very Best that’s a unsatisfactory grade.

In every single scenario for these questions better moves we could’ve made without hindsight needed.

Part of the reason I believe Mitchell Robinson and RJ Barrett have been so disappointing this season were the absolute disasters of free agent signings we wasted our cap space on, -Marcus Morris I will never say anything bad about that man. 

What makes wasting the cap space worse for me is I cannot justify trading Porzingis for what we got back anymore. Part of being a fan is just being salty My birthday gift was tickets to see my first Knicks game(adult life Knicks bad, tickets expensive, wanted a win 1st game)against the Mavericks just to boo that man. I would’ve loved to of been in a position to say we were better off without him we made the right move trading Porzingis but I can’t and I really want to for the value we got back there’s absolutely no justification for trading him.

#Players we signed, why we shouldn’t have signed them, player, other options available

###Bobby Portis

A Young Center/Power Forward than that provides no mentorship for Mitchell Robinson and is worse than him now. In a vacuum I can understand why you would sign a stretch big young player. However understanding personal in team construction is important. Bobby Portis had a reputation of being a hothead and himself being a young player who is worse than Robinson don’t understand the value of signing him especially when these other options were available.

**Players who are stretch bigs that got equal value or less**

Brook Lopez who got significantly less and played and New York before.

Jonas Valanciunas, a better player than Bobby Portis, young stretch five Who is greatly contributing to a playoff team and has a excellent reputation with both raptors and grizzlies fans.

What is worse is we already had a young stretch big that was significantly cheaper on the roster 

Luke Kornet who signed under 3 mil for 2 years in Chicago. For the value both Bobby and Luke Kornet provide, Luke is clearly better, not the better player the better, value.

###Taj Gibson

I understand why we signed him see the value of A veteran like him on our roster but not for the price tag or role he has. **A starting center???* if he was a back up power forward/small ball center for certain line ups got paid for half of what he got I’d have no complaints, he’s from New York and like the idea of Knick fans playing for the team but for that price tag?

**Starting caliber centers that got less**
Just a highlight the overpay not even going to put equal value 

Robin Lopez, former Knick, would provide respectable minutes when Robinson gets in foul trouble and we could justify starting over. 

Dwight Howard, despite character concerns, would be perfect mentor for the shotblocking prodigy Robinson is. Dwight Howard was under contract for $5 million on the Grizzles that didn’t want him and almost any trade we would’ve offered would’ve been preferable to them than a buyouts even if it was just The rights to some international player, the cap space would’ve been valuable for the grizzlies. Dominant big man in his prime 4x DPOY, currently one of the better traditional big men in the league.  Dwight Howard mentoring Mitchell Robinson like DeAndre did could’ve led to a more productive sophomore season. If not he provided someone to go against in practice which would help him develop as well.

JaVale McGee shot blocker who had his issues as a young player and could’ve use that experience to help Mitchell Robinson develop. Respectable shot blocker.

We could’ve literally signed one of these players with Taj Gibson instead of just over paying Taj Gibson. If Taj Gibson didn’t want to be on the knicks at that value I am not losing sleep over that.

###Julius Randle

I actually liked the move at the time but I am not a front office employee and was just thirsty for young talent,didn’t use any critical thinking, just liked the idea of a 24 year old power forward 21/9. Julius Randle has been an absolute disaster on our team. He has become an utter joke to us Knick fans. We refer to him as Julius “spin Move turnover” Randle, and “Beyblade”. Knowing who we drafted and who our best young player was(Mitchell Robinson) why on earth would we send a significant amount of Space on a young player that does not fit with our best young players? 

**Acceptable uses of that cap space for a similar amount or less, would’ve been a better fit, that would probably have the same amount trade value as Randle**
Harrison Barnes, Bojan Bogdanovich, Jeremy Lamb, Rudy Gay.

**Here are other young players who signed we could’ve signed that have more upside, have more trade value, better fit and frankly better players.**
Kelly Oubre Jr, D’Angelo Russell, Malcolm Brogdon

Not signing D’Angelo Russell especially is the most unforgivable giving the fact the Timberwolves were incredibly thirsty for him and could’ve netted us a lottery first round pick even if we didn’t like his play with us. D’Angelo Russell and Frank Ntilikina point guard rotation could’ve been exciting if we wanted to retain him, Need a bucket put in D’Lo need a stop put Frank in. 

At the time before the offseason if we didn’t get KD/Kyrie, I wanted re-sign DeAndre Jordan for One year with a player option. He might’ve left for the Nets anyway but I can see al the incentive for him to choose staying on the Knicks as he can still live in the city and hang out with his friends and while he got overpaid by us for 20 to 25 mil for one season, us(with an option of retaining him if we strike out in this years offseason) and then getting a bag next season with KD and Kyrie in the front offices ear seems very possible. And unlike other overpays we did it would’ve actually served a purpose Look at Mitchell Robinson’s [stats after the DeAndre Jordan trade](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/robinmi01/gamelog/2019/#36-66-sum:pgl_basic), Almost a double double with 3 blocks a game! 29 consecutive games of blocking 2 or more shots. He was extremely important to Mitchell Robinson‘s explosion last year and was a great veteran for him to have, if we are going to overpay a vet that is going to start over a young player let it serve a purpose. 


###Elfrid Payton

Was just an unnecessary signing entirely. 
Does he have more upside than Frank Ntilikina? No
Is Payton significantly better than him or provide a better value on the court for our teams future playing him over Frank? No 
I might be in the minority but I think Frank is just flat out better than Elfrid Payton, but even if I am wrong you cannot convince me Elfrid Payton wasn’t a wasted signing. His value added playing any is not more than the value of Frank playing. Even if you don’t like Ntlikina last year, Always made great passes and despite not having good assist Numbers capable playmaker, leading the Team in hockey assists. Frank Ntilikina has always been the better defender his rookie season he was the best pick and roll defender and even after a season played with injuries were still a above average defender last year. He clearly progressed as a player this season and clearly believe Frank provided better value playing then Elfrid Payton.

Elfrid Payton is somehow is a ball hog despite his reputation as a playmaker only passing it to Julius “spin move turnover” Randle. He isn’t a three point shooter, so we didn’t sign him for spacing and isn’t an offense of threat. 
He had a couple triple doubles cool, so did Dennis Smith Jr. and despite my issues with him he clearly has more upside than Payton and has more trade value. 

Signing Payton was a bad idea, promising him a starting role worse idea. Even if you don’t believe in your young point guards, I don’t see the value of adding a “proven vet” to play over those two recent lottery picks, why not give them an opportunity to prove you wrong. From a pragmatic standpoint to get maximum trade value, have them play significant minutes for highlights, stats and flashes that might convince a team to trade for them, rather than have them benched for a guard of Payton’s caliber. 

If you absolutely wanted a veteran point Guard to start over the prospects to make them “earn it”, then at the very least sign someone who offered spacing with playmaking abilities to run an offense effectively and utilize the other young players we had. 

*If You wanted to sign he starting caliber point guard that offseason* 

Derrick Rose (three-point percentage this year isn’t what it was last year but I’m not using hindsight), despite a uninspiring 2016-17 year with us signing Derrick Rose would’ve made sense  Derrick Rose is prime is the best,and currently unlikely, case scenario for Dennis Smith Jr. having a player like Derrick Rose to mentor him would’ve provided great value over Payton. Despite not wanting him to re-sign for the 2017- 2018 season thinking that he was washed immature former star who wouldn’t adapt to a different role, would be bad for young players development and wouldn’t serve any value for us he proved me wrong on all fronts and I’m not ashamed to admit it. He was a great vet for Minnesota and Detroit. He wouldn’t be offended at reduced minutes either given his history and that would allow us to play Frank and Dennis for significant minutes on top of having a veteran starting point guard with trade value.

###Wayne Ellington and Reggie Bullock

They were so low impact they getting grouped together. Just why? We had Damyean Dotson who was the same caliber of shooter as them, and Allonzo Trier who shot a better percent from 3. Both of those Young players have more upside could shoot and are on the last year on their contracts. What was the point of signing and playing lower tier shooters that have no future on a rebuilding team over player who we need to decide if they are going to be in our future and what they are worth. If you were convinced they had no future with then why didn’t we trade them for value at the deadline? What was the point? Waste 12 million in cap space and waste the young players value on the bench souring our relationship with them if we want re-sign them. Just illogical and dumb they provided no value and was just a waste.

###Now for Traded we could have made accepting salary dumps that would’ve netted us assets

Andre Iguodala a 2024 warriors 1st round pick 

Moe Harkless 2023 Miami 1st round pick

Tony Snell the Buck’s 30th pick 2019

TJ Warren the suns 32nd pick 2019 

Josh Jackson a 2020 2nd and a conditional second 

[And according to](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2019/06/20/report-rockets-tried-to-give-away-chris-paul-but-teams-including-knicks-said-no/)[multiple different](https://clutchpoints.com/knicks-rumors-new-york-refused-rockets-offer-trading-chris-paul-into-cap-space/) [articles and media personal ](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2838533-5-teams-who-could-try-to-land-chris-paul)
We could’ve traded for Chris Paul. 
Let me say at the time was completely against this but that was a result of being burned too many times of acquiring washed former stars. Imagine Mitchell Robinson being thrown lives by Chris Paul or RJ Barrett learning under Chris Paul like Shia Gilgeous Alexander learned under him. It would’ve been a lot more fun than watching the players we did sign.

So let me ask again What was the goal of our team for the 2019-2020 season?

**Make the playoffs?**

If that was the goal we should’ve traded for Chris Paul, Dwight Howard, and TJ warren signed Melo (vet min PF) and tried 

CP3
RJ
TJ
Melo
Mitchell Robinson/Dwight 
A bench of Dotson, Trier, Frank, DSJ, Knox and Trier seems more likely to make the playoffs then the product we rolled our 

**Sign trade assets to trade for value for long-term moves?**

Literally every free agent except for Marcus Morris we signed shouldn’t have been signed. Marcus Morris thankfully got us something but we should’ve either signed D’Angelo Russell, Oubre, Malcolm Brogdon that definitely worth first round picks. Or Accept the salary dumps we potentially could’ve gotten gotten an extra 3 1st round picks productive player on great contract TJ warren. Moe Harkless Tony snell could have been our PF that was genuinely a position of need last off-season. Take a Flyer in Josh Jackson and potentially trade Iggy for Winslow That would’ve been the best possible use of Space if that was our goal. 

**Try to improve on what we have and be competitive?**

If this was the goal we should’ve signed players that actually fit our roster, possible moves we could have made listed above.

Overall The Knicks on almost every level completely blew the off-season. we could’ve signed young players that fit with our team and timeline Veterans that fit our team with a long term benefit. We completely blew the off-season the cap space we had was completely wasted and now need to trade Julius Randle.

# **TLDR:**

We made pointless moves that didn’t make us better in the short term nor help us in the long term. We signed two low impact veteran shooting guards, that are worse than our young shooting guards we didn’t play to justify instead of accepting the sunken cost. Overpaid 2 young players that don’t fit with our best young players and don’t offer much in terms of trade value compared to other options we could have made in the offseason.

I don't mind if they skip the regular season this year, but I still think those team who will miss the playoffs and those players as well deserve to be able to have a consolation to the sudden stop. That is why another tournament during the playoffs which will be just like a little fun tournament should be implemented but I also think this can be an experiment.

  I think a tournament in the future in general can be a good way to combat the tanking issue that has been a bit popular recently and maybe add more incentives for these tanking teams. Another tournament could maybe be for draft positioning or maybe other things like cap space for their teams or whatever.

 I feel like people will hate this cause it could overlap playoff games and two this could favor those 9 to 10th seeds or risk of injury but same time it could be worth a gamble.

  With overlapping, this is why I think maybe this could be a good way to shorten the season to maybe four to ten games. The tournament could replace like the last days of the 82 regular season while the playoff teams get rest. So you could still hold this tournament before the playoffs. Even if you hold this tournament during the playoffs, I mean maybe playing it earlier before playoff games is still possible and can hold decent ratings. Even I don't think ratings for these games should matter much anyway.

  I just think this can be a good way for teams to maybe earn their draft positionin more than the taking culture we still hear.

The one name I keep circling back to: Hassan Whiteside. 

Whiteside has long been a polarizing player in the league. Is he a good defender, or does he put up empty stats? Do the large amount of blocks he totals season after season mean anything? He’s already  30 and will be 31 by the time the season resumes, or next season starts. What you have with Whiteside is likely what you’ll get for the rest of his career. But does that translate to value? (I ask these questions to be answered, but also just for food for thought). 

I went through every team and made a quick summary of whether or not a team would a) be interested in Whiteside in FA, b) could realistically afford him (basing his next contract off of recent contracts), c) would the team be a good fit and d) does it make sense? Feel free to disagree with me! I always welcome feedback and discussion. I’ll be doing more of a ‘in a vacuum’ rather than ‘if x happens, then maybe’. 

**Atlanta Hawks:** Unlikely. The Hawks traded for Clint Capela this season to (presumably) be their franchise center and pick-and-roll partner with Young. Barring them moving Capela in the offseason, it doesn’t make sense to pay $10+ million for a backup big who has starting experience. 

**Boston Celtics:** More likely than people think, but not a guarantee. As a Celtics fan I wouldn’t mind Whiteside on a higher AAV one-year deal (with a team option), or even a two-year deal. My bias aside, the Celtics are set to enter next season with Vincent Poirier and Robert Williams officially under contract. Kanter could opt-in and Theis has exceeded any expectations I had for him entering the season, but his contract is non-guaranteed and with Tatum becoming contract extension eligible, they’ll need every penny if Hayward opts-in. Whiteside could provide the shot-blocking presence and rebounder the Celtics **still** need. 

**Brooklyn Nets:** Unlikely. Even though Allen has been linked in trade rumors to land a third star next to Irving and Durant, I think they should roll into next season with what they have currently to evaluate before they break up existing chemistry. Granted, Allen has come off the bench more in favor of Durant and Irving’s BFF Jordan, but Allen is still developing and already a great young player. Whiteside here doesn’t make sense. 

**Charlotte Hornets:** Possibly. The Hornets only have Cody Zeller under contract at the 5 spot for next season. Zeller has been remarkably consistent and is a starting center in this league; but has battled injuries over the past few seasons. Whiteside could sign a short-term deal to recoup value and possibly earn a better deal next year. This landing spot makes the most sense so far. 

**Chicago Bulls:** The Bulls finally saw (some) of the errors of their ways and made changes in the front office, but until the offseason begins, we won’t really have an idea of what the Bulls’ direction is. Currently the Bulls seem committed to the Markannen/Carter Jr. combo, which I think is a smart move. The Bulls won’t be championship contenders next season and Whiteside wouldn’t make much of an impact. 

**Cleveland Cavaliers:** The Cavaliers’ offseason really starts and ends with Andre Drummond. If Drummond opts in, then they’re essentially locked into their young core + Love. If Drummond signs a long-term extension, the same story. If Drummond opts out... I expect both he and Thompson to leave, leaving a huge hole in the front court for a young team. Whiteside seems to want to win, but the Cavaliers’ defense would drastically get worse if both bigs left. There’s a slim chance here. 

**Dallas Mavericks:** This landing spot is interesting to me. After the Mitchell-Gobert saga, Gobert was and still is heavily being linked to Dallas and the infatuation they have with European players. Aside from that connection, the fit does make sense for Dallas and Gobert, but not Utah. Who would Utah acquire that would help them stay competitive and/or replicate what Gobert does for them? Gobert’s long term fit was a long-winded discussion prior to COVID-19, but I just don’t see a trade package where Utah benefits. I digress. 

If Powell comes back healthy next season and Dallas brings back THJ, then the Mavericks could make some noise next postseason. They were playing at a historic offensive pace with Powell and still a historic pace without him. Whiteside’s play style is nearly the exact opposite of Dallas’ bigs, but that doesn’t mean Whiteside couldn’t work in Dallas. The question that needs to be answered first is what is Porzingis’ position? 

 **Denver Nuggets:** Probably not happening. Jokic is Denver’s center of the future, but Denver has a lot of impending free agents of their own. I doubt Whiteside would consider being a backup unless most/all of Denver’s bigs leave in free agency. 

**Detroit Pistons:** After trading Drummond the Pistons have a glaring need at center, but would likely try to target a younger big they could build around; either in the draft or in free agency. Whiteside could be a stopgap option if they go the draft route, but otherwise I just don't see it happening on yet another rebuilding Detroit team.  

**Golden State Warriors:** Maybe? The Warriors have been linked to James Wiseman, wanting to trade for Giannis, being willing to trade whatever pick they land in the lottery (presumably a top-3 selection) for an established big man... but what if they trade the pick to fill out their depth and sign Whiteside as a rim-running, shot-blocker? McGee thrived in that role and that’s all Whiteside would have to do playing next to a healthy Curry, Thompson and Draymond. The cap space would be tight, but Boogie signed a way lower value deal than anyone expected to play in Golden State. 

**Houston Rockets:** Unless the Rockets have a change of heart (were linked to bigs like Al Horford and Rudy Gobert after they traded Capela) and/or realize playing a 35 yo P.J. Tucker into the ground is a horrible idea, Whiteside’s play style is fairly similar to Capela’s. He’s better than playing Tyson Chandler at this point in his career. 

**Indiana Pacers:** Until the Pacers figure out if they want to play Turner and Sabonis together, this destination doesn’t make any sense with Goga in the wings. 

**Los Angeles Clippers:** My first reaction was to say ‘yes! Whiteside would be perfect for the Clippers!’... and then I remembered that the Clippers play Zubac under 20 MPG. Why would Whiteside get any more, especially if they re-sign Harrell? 

**Los Angeles Lakers:** This landing spot only makes sense if at least *two* of Dwight, McGee or AD leaves. If AD leaves I don’t think that means LeBron does, but the Lakers would be left in quite the predicament if he does. Whiteside landing on a championship-caliber team would really hinge on the aforementioned players. 

**Memphis Grizzlies:** Highly unlikely. The Grizzlies already has a rotation of Clarke, JJJ and Dieng with no real path to moving any unless they were trying to get a star. Whiteside would get zero playing time. 

**Miami Heat:** No way he goes back to the franchise he’s publicly bashed. 

**Milwaukee Bucks:** Whiteside would flourish as a backup big in Milwaukee, but unless Robin Lopez signs elsewhere (which I don’t think he will, he’s playing on a championship-caliber team with his brother), this isn’t happening. 

**Minnesota Timberwolves:** Towns’ shooting ability would allow Whiteside to play as a center, but Towns is best at the 5 spot and the Timberwolves have too many young, impending free agents to worry about first. Whiteside wouldn’t accelerate their chances of title contention. 

**New Orleans Pelicans:** This would be the second most likely destination to me. Favors has been great in New Orleans, but I just have a gut feeling he seeks a reunion with Utah. Obviously that doesn’t mean Whiteside goes to New Orleans, but he would be a great lob threat with Lonzo and Co. as Hayes continues to develop. 

**New York Knicks:** It would be a Knicks move to sign another big, but if Leon Rose and Co. are truly committed to making the Knicks relevant again, they shouldn’t sign a big that would block playing time for Robinson. With that being said, Whiteside will probably sign in New York. 

 **Oklahoma City Thunder:** Adams is the Thunder’s starting center of the future, so unless Noel goes elsewhere in free agency there really isn’t an avenue to major playing time. 

**Orlando Magic:** Despite the Magic making improvements in recent years, they still haven’t figured out their big rotation. Trying to sort it out always gives me a headache. They need to figure out the direction they’re heading in before considering adding Whiteside to a rotation of Bamba, Vucevic, Birch, Isaac and Gordon. 

**Philadelphia 76ers:** The Sixers have needed bench help for the past few seasons and it’s been exposed in the postseason. With that being said, barring a season-ending injury for Embiid, they can continue to scrape by with the Mike Scott types as a backup. They need shooting more than they need a backup big. 

**Phoenix Suns:** For better or worse the Suns are committed to Ayton. Despite his ineptitude at times, the Suns’ owner recognizes how bad it would look if the Suns moved Ayton now; especially if the return was draft picks/minimal. Baynes was excellent while Ayton was suspended and I wouldn’t be surprised if he re-signed. 

 **Portland Trail Blazers:** On the surface it would make sense for Portland to re-sign its starting center from this season, but with Nurkic reportedly being close to 100% and the jury still out on if Collins’ best position is at the 4 or 5, Whiteside wouldn’t have much playing time if both are on the court next season. He has seemed to really enjoy Portland and has played well for them, but Portland is already committed to paying \~ $75 million to Lillard, McCollum and Nurkic already. It just doesn’t seem feasible. 

**Sacramento Kings:** Whiteside started his career in Sacramento, but averaged very little playing time. Lineups with Bjelica at the 5 have crushed opponents this season, but Bjelica is better used as a stretch-4 on offense. If the Kings want to try a Bagley-Bjelica frontcourt I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, but they would be better off with a more traditional center and lob threat for Fox (and Bogdanovic and/or Hield, depending if one leaves this offseason via trade or free agency) in Whiteside. It’s not out of the realm of possibility IMO. 

**San Antonio Spurs:** I have a gut feeling Popovich retires this offseason, but regardless if he does or not the Spurs value discipline in their players. Whiteside has a tendency to gamble too much defensively which would likely make Pop or whoever the next head coach tear their hair out. I don’t think San Antonio is suddenly going to become a perpetual lottery team, but Whiteside just seems too counter-cultural to fit. 

**Toronto Raptors:** This moves really hinges on what Ibaka and Gasol do in free agency. If one or both leave then Whiteside has a fantastic opportunity for playing time and the opportunity to win (assuming Toronto wants him). A Siakam-Whiteside front court is intriguing at the very least, and wouldn’t be asked to do much in Toronto. (Think Valanciunas + shot blocking). 

**Utah Jazz:** I don’t see this happening, especially if my prediction about Favors returning comes true. Even if Mitchell and Gobert are still at odds despite a public declaration they were good, Whiteside would barely play off the bench. Utah has finally started to embrace a more modern offense, Whiteside could reverse that. 

**Washington Wizards:** I think this is the most likely destination. Washington has done a nice job of collecting ‘scraps’ from other teams and uncovering some nice gems in Thomas Bryant, Moe Wagner, Davis Bertans, etc. Even if all return next season, the Wizards could use a more physical presence at the 5, which is exactly what Whiteside is. I could see him signing a deal a la Dwight Howard a few years ago and see where things go for a season or two with a (reportedly) healthy John Wall and (hopefully) Bradley Beal. Hachimura may become a 5 as he continues to bulk up, but a Wall-Beal-Brown-Hachimura-Whiteside starting five isn’t bad at all.

I've attached a Google Sheet with the ending calculations and further explanation. Simply put, I gave out 4 points every season. I split up 1 point to all those who received an MVP vote. Split up another point to all those on the first and second team All-NBA. Another point was split between all the All-Stars. Then, a final point was split between the top playoff performers in a given year. Summing everything together across all the players' careers, I came up with these tiers:

Tier 1: Michael Jordan, Lebron James

Tier 2: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar

Tier 3: George Mikan, Bill Russell, Larry Bird, Wilt Chamberlain, Magic Johnson, Shaquille O'Neil

Tier 4: Tim Duncan, Jerry West, Bob Pettit, Julius Erving, Kobe Bryant, Karl Malone, Hakeem Olajuwon, Dolph Schayes, Oscar Robertson, Moses Malone, Kevin Durant

Tier 5: Bob Cousy, Elgin Baylor, Dirk Nowitzki, Stephen Curry, Charles Barkley, Kevin Garnett, James Harden, George Gervin, David Robinson, Rick Barry, John Havlicek, Chris Paul, Steve Nash, Paul Arizin, Allen Iverson, Russell Westbrook, Giannis Antetokounmpo (assuming he wins MVP this year)

I think this is a simple, fair, objective ranking. If you don't think much of players from the 50s, that's fine, but I didn't hold anything against them. Current players are in the midst of their careers, so they will get more points in future seasons. Curry and Harden could easily get to Tier 4, Giannis could easily get to Tier 3, and Kawhi could easily get to Tier 5.

Takes (ie why these players are in Tier 4):

Kobe - Not a top 10 career. He was a top 5 player for a long time, but was never really the dominant, best player in the league. Basically tied for last among the top 4 tiers in terms of MVP votes. Playoffs was a little better, but I only had him as the most impactful player once in 2010 (in 2009 when Lakers beat Magic, I had Lebron who averaged 35ppg and carried trash Cavs to ECF as top player). He did have a number of others where he was top five in playoffs.

Olajuwon - A top 10ish playoff perfomer of all time, but lacking in other categories. Like Kobe, basically tied for last in MVP votes among top 20 players. He had less MVP votes than contemporaries Barkley, Robinson, and Malone. He was very good, but not an utterly dominant regular season player.

Dolph Schayes - Top 5 player for a decade. Not counted in this, but most win shares in 50s. He wasn't dominant or won a bunch of titles, so he didn't reach legend status an has since been forgotten.

Oscar Robertson - His lack of rings is noted, but he didn't have a single year where he was the best player in the playoffs. You can give the excuse of Russell and Chamberlain, but Pettit, West, and Baylor all managed.

Big sports media like ESPN is putting Bill Russell No. 4 all time which I don’t think he should be anywhere near.

My first point is that skill wise this man was not even comparable to Joel Embiid. He never got over 19 PPG in any season in his career despite playing 40+ minutes in almost every season. This is kind of absurd to me as there wasn’t as many good centers in the league at the time who should have been able to hold Bill Russell to single digits very often. Obviously he was a monster rebound wise but then again the amount of missed shots and the pace that was played would make it nearly impossible to not grab at least 10 a game as fast breaks were really the only way teams tried to score.

People often bring up his defensive ability as a reason he was so “good”, but the only center at the time who would be anywhere near top all time was, as you probably know, wilt chamberlain who almost always scored at least 30 on Bill Russell and very many times had 40, 50, and even 60 on him a few times. A few head to heads against wilt caught my eye like the time bill went 0/14 against wilt or when wilt dropped 62 on 60% fg%. 

Playoff Bill Russell was not much different from regular season Bill Russell as his numbers were damn near the exact same. Now winning is obviously a big part in being in the greatest of all time rankings and even though he has his 11 rings is that more impressive than Jordan’s 6? The talent level was just not the same than it is now and some might argue the concentration of talent was bigger cause of the less than 10 teams, but I still don’t think it compares to now even a little bit. If Bill Russell was to play now (I don’t like playing the what if game but this really does make a difference) he wouldn’t be anywhere near as “dominant” as some people claim that he is. Another point to his rings is that the amount of all stars and hall of fame players he had to help him out compared to other teams at the time just shows how the Celtics then were like the warriors dynasty on steroids. 

If I was to assess where Bill Russell ranks all time I don’t even think I’d put him top 20.

For the last two summers, I and 29 other Redditors have gotten together and done an all-time NBA draft tournament. It's essentially a big fantasy draft, but with any player who's ever played available. We all had a lot of fun, so along with u/Celticsfor18th and u/Soshi101, I'm trying to put together a third season for this summer.

Some specifics on how it works:

* Each person is the general manager of one team. Draft is standard snake format - round 1 goes 1 through 30, round 2 goes in reverse order 30 to 1, and so forth.

* GMs can pick any player who has played in the NBA, ABA, BAA, or NBL, but **you must pick a specific season of each player. Only one season from any given player can be picked, but it must be specified.** So for example, once Michael Jordan 1990-1991 is picked, MJ is off the table - you can't take his DPOY season or anything else. We will keep track of all this through a Google sheet which we can all edit. No messing around with anyone else's picks :)

* **Length:** In the past, we have done 10 rounds, and while it has been tons of fun, it has gotten pretty slow by the end. We've had some discussions in the past of possible ways to address this. Rather than make a decision to shorten it or not on my own, I figured we could vote between a few options once we have our 30 people - 10 rounds like before, 8 rounds since that's an average playoff rotation, or else 8 rounds + an undrafted free agency period where everybody takes two guys on a first come first served basis. After all the teams are taken, I'll start a new subreddit and put up a poll.

* On that note, I'd like to make it clear that while anyone who's interested in participating is welcome, you should be aware that this requires some commitment to see it through to the end. We've typically had a 24-hour pick limit and it still takes multiple months. So please, **don't drop out halfway through** - for every person who does that, we have to find someone new to take over a half-done team. I think the most fun part is the end anyway, when you're digging up guys you've never heard of before. Just be ready to stick with it.

* Finally, to claim a team, please **reply to the stickied comment** - this way you let everyone else know the team's taken as soon as your comment's up, and you also avoid the minimum character limit which would auto-remove short replies to the post. Teams are first come first served, I'll edit GMs into the post as I see teams claimed, and I will take whatever is left once 29 have been chosen. The draft order is determined through random number generation and will be released once everyone has chosen a team.

Happy drafting! Hope you guys have fun!

* **LeBron** - leading the team with the second best record in the NBA. Scoring good (although not as good as previous years), leading the league in assists
* **Luka** - Carrying the Dallas offense, close to triple-double, showing jumps from his rookie year. Plus Dallas is better than most anticipated.
* **Kawhi** - Scoring volume up, doing more offensive playmaking for others, more two-way impact than most of top players, leading Clippers to team success
* **Anthony Davis** - Combines scoring volume with elite efficiency, legit DPOY candidate along with Giannis. Team success.
* **Lillard** - Has really upped his offense, setting career highs in basically every category, including efficiency (scoring, Ast/TO ratio). Portland hasn't been good though, and Lillard's not a very good defensive player.

Longevity: Including this season Paul has been in the NBA for 15 years of those seasons I think 14 have been at a very high level (not as a rookie although he was still quite solid. Kidd played much longer but the time where he’s numbers where comparable (still worse) were from 98-2004 so much shorter. Isaiah played 13 years and his last year was not great but even counting that it’s shorter than Paul. Nash first good season was 2000 and his last was 10 so again shorter than Paul, Stockton probably has the only argument on longevity Playing from 84-03 but his first good year was 87 and his stats fall off after 97. 

So all around Paul has already been at a top level longer than the rest and is still playing.

2.	⁠Everything after 10 seems pretty debatable, dependent on a player’s impact on history. Curry and KD’s ranking feels it should be swapped, but I think Curry is right where he belongs.
3.	⁠Players like Damian Lillard, Anthony Davis, sneaking in to the lowest region of this list - any disagreements on that? Especially leaving out Dwight Howard, whose had a great HOF career up until his tenure in HOU.
4.	⁠Kawhi at 25? Agree or disagree?
5.	⁠Giannis at 27? Despite his relatively short career thus far being a superstar, is this too high? Considering he is two spots away from Kawhi, whose 2019 Finals run is cemented as one of the best while also having 2 Finals MVPs?

I started watching ball in the 80s, so it's a little tougher for me to speculate about Wilt, Russell, etc.  Centers rarely ever shot from distance, so even if they had the ability to do it, their coaches probably would have set their asses on fire if they dared to.  Nowadays, centers who can't shoot it better learn quickly, or else they could be out of a job.

I could see Hakeem Olajuwon putting in the work.  He had such a complete game already.  His shooting form was steady and his footwork was off the charts.  I'm a huge Olajuwon booster, so I think he could dominate in any era. 

David Robinson liked to shoot from mid range, but I don't know how his shooting form suits the 3.  He did hit 10 of 29 in '93-'94, but I think that was a year when they pulled the 3 point line in a few feet to boost scoring.  Maybe he would have adapted over time.

Patrick Ewing probably shot too many long twos, but he was a pretty solid shooter.  I'm sure he would have added a consistent 3 pointer to his arsenal.  However, looking up his stats, his season high for makes was only 6, also in one of the shortened 3 point line seasons ('94-'95).

Shaq?  No way, but I'm sure he'd throw them up once in a while just to mess around.

Going back a bit further, I just can't see Kareem shooting them.  He only made one in his regular season career.  Not sure what to say about other 70s/early 80s guys like Moses or Lanier.

THE RECORD MAKERS

From time to time there are angry protests from NBA teams and players about the official scoring system in the league. It is decidedly bush, with home-town favouritism blatantly evident in the recording of individual statistics. The NBA Guide, for instance, lists 23 rebounding performances of 40 rebounds or more in a game. Just one of these records was made without the benefit of a home-town statistician. Similarly, only one of the top 36 assist marks was made on the road.

A classic scoring goof was made in a 76er-Bullet game two years ago when the official box score credited Gerry Ward with one field goal in no attempts (1 for 0). There was also the time that Hal Greer took six shots in a game and made seven of them, according to the stat men. And at half time in the All-Star game in January, Greer was credited with making two baskets but only taking one shot.

In a recent game in Evansville, Ind. between Chicago and St. Louis the official scorer recorded only three assists for the Hawks' Len Wilkens, who tops the league in that category. This led to immediate retribution when the Bulls visited St. Louis. At half time a Chicago official complained to Hawks General Manager Marty Blake that the Bulls' Jim Washington had been credited with only two rebounds. Blake replied, "" Washington will get another rebound when Wilkens gets an assist in Evansville.""

Currently, Wilt Chamberlain is leading the league in complaining about statistics, and probably with good reason. Philadelphia Statistician Harvey Pollack is one of the few well-regarded scorers in the NBA. He won't favour anyone, including Wilt, but he thinks Chamberlain probably has a valid complaint. To check for himself, Pollack decided two Sundays ago to keep his own box score as he watched the telecast of a game between the 76ers and the Hawks in St. Louis. The official statistics showed Wilkens with 13 assists and Chamberlain with four. Pollack, however, credited eight to Wilkens and nine to Chamberlain. ""I knew it was coming,"" Pollack said, ""because Chamberlain was catching Wilkens in total assists.""

http://www.nba.com/encyclopedia/pollack_wilt.html I went to a Boston-Warriors game in the Boston Garden and secretly kept track of the rebounds of both Wilt and Russell. When the game ended, I went to the press table and asked what the rebound totals were for Wilt and Russell. The response: ""Russell 35, Wilt 22."" My response, ""Well my totals are Wilt 34, Russell 21."" They sat open-mouthed when I produced my evidence of the time and type of every rebound that each player had. A Sports Illustrated writer nearby heard the conversation and asked me what it was all about. I told him and the next week SI had a story about the incident. Wilt and I chuckled on reading it, but Red Auerbach didn't. For many years thereafter he didn't talk to me, but how we were reconciled is another story that doesn't concern Wilt.

Sports Illustrated - April 19, 1965

THE ASSAILABLE STATISTICAL

Doubling as press agent for the 76ers basketball team and as keeper of the team scores, Philadelphia Harvey Pollack is a two-portfolio man. Life for P.R. Man Pollack is fine; his team has come far this season. But life for Statistician Pollack is agonizing. He has the feeling that he is being rebounded.

Pollack is one of those basketball buffs caught up in the game-within-a-game drama being played at the moment between Wilt Chamberlain of the 76ers and Bill Russell of the Boston Celtics. Officially—or statistically, as they say in the National Basketball Association—Russell and Chamberlain are very close in their skill at getting the ball off the backboards—1,878 to 1,673 for the season. Unofficially, statistically or otherwise, this cannot be true, says Pollack, and he hopes to prove it.

In one recent game Boston scorekeeper, Dennis Whitmarsh counted 32 rebounds for Russell, 31 for Chamberlain. Pollack, at the same game, tallied it more like 18 for Russell and 30 for Chamberlain.

The dispute over which is the better backboard man is, of course, one of those arguments without end. What concerns us is that there should be such an argument at all. The trouble probably lies in the fact that each NBA team hires its own official scorekeeper, each subject to intense home-town pressures. Even so, the wide disparity in counts should properly puzzle fans. Doesn't one simply count the rebounds and leave it at that? The figures should not be Boston statistics or Philadelphia statistics but just plain, old, correct statistics.

American sports fans have long regarded official records as unassailable—a sort of fortress of agate type to which one could retreat when all else failed. That official records should differ dismays us. As an unofficial group, that is. Statistically speaking, of course.

To have those Wilt/Russell totals totally flipped is pretty fishy. on rebounds as They either go out of bounds, or somebody grabbed it. That should be pretty clear-cut. I don't see how they could get some of the discrepancies as listed above.

I guess this shows that the Boston scorekeepers cooked Russell's stats a bit.

It does change my perception of him as I'm fascinated by the rebound differential. between him and Wilt If it's true then Russell got a huge boost to his stats that has to make people look at him differently. I'm assuming those 10 block games of his didn't happen as often as people have said. i am thinking they did this as Russell was the hero of Boston. and they cant have him outplayed in Boston Garden so they did what they had to do make sure Bill looked good against Wilt.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,86167,public,self,Wilt Chamberlain lead the league in complaining about statistics with good reason in the 1960s,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/gisupq/wilt_chamberlain_lead_the_league_in_complaining/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,

Arenas averaged 29/6 with 2 steals in 05-06 and 28/6 with 2 steals in 06-07, Jamison put up 20/9 and 20/8, while Butler contributed with 18/6 with 2 steals and 18/7 with 2 steals. Arenas was selected to the ASG in both seasons, getting named to the All NBA Third Team in the first one and Second Team in the second one. Butler got to the ASG in his second season, meanwhile Jamison was on the verge of being selected both times, which is evident by him making the team in 05 and 08 with simillar numbers. 



So you have an All NBA PG and all star quality players at both the SF and PF position. You add a 3 and D shooting guard in Deshawn Stevenson and a good rebounder and defender at the center position in Brendan Haywood, and you got yourself quite a good team.



So what happened to them? Why weren’t they more successful? Well, they ran into LeBron’s Cavs both times in the First Round and ended up losing the series both times. Arenas had problems with injuries later on and Antawn and Caron became older, so the team fell off.

I may attach an Excel sheet in the comments to help this make more visual sense. But here it goes:

This year, the All Star Weekend happened from Feb 14-16. My proposed single-elimination cup tournament would’ve run from Feb 4-13, so the All Star Weekend festivities could run as we know and love.

To make it work, there would be a “Midseason Break” in regular season games between Saturday Feb 1- Wednesday Feb 19. The teams would get a ping-pong ball numbered between 1-30 based on regular season records on Feb. 1, and the first round  Cup Draw would happen on Feb. 1, in Saturday Night primetime.

The top team in each conference gets a BYE to the Second Round. 

The remaining teams are given a ping-pong ball between 3-30, and the balls are drawn randomly from there into 14 pairs. The second ball in each pair would be the “home team.”

The first 7 pairs to be drawn would be Group A, and would play first round games on Tuesday Feb. 4. The other 7 would be Group B, and would play on Wednesday Feb. 5. 

At the end of the draw, the Bucks (due to having the best record) would be able to decide which Group they prefer to enter in the 2nd Round. The Lakers would be drawn into the other group. Obviously, this would be GREAT for drama, as 14 teams would feel disrespected.

Before I dive further into this, let me give a Cup schedule. 

Feb 4-5: First Round (7 gms each day)

Feb 6-7: 2nd Round (4 gms each day)

Feb 8-9: QF (2 gms each day)

Feb 10-11: Semifinals

Feb 13: Cup Final (Played in ASG City)

——

So the Group A teams would play on even number days, &amp; Group B would play on odd number days. 

In the first round, 4 games each day could be nationally televised. The remaining rounds could all be nationally televised &amp; divided amongst the current TV networks.

Ok, how would the draw have looked this year? I used a random number generator to get the following matchups.

Group A (Feb 4)

19 v 18 - SA at ORL

29 v 3 - CLE at TOR

11 v 26 - DAL at MIN (TNT)

27 v 14 - NY at MEM (NBATV)

30 v 17 - GS at SAC (TNT)

28 v 23 - ATL at CHA

20 v 25 - NO at DET (NBATV)

Group B (Feb 5)

4 v 6 - LAC v DEN (ESPN)

9 v 5 - UTA v BOS (ESPN)

24 v 16 - CHI v BK

8 v 15 - MIA v POR (ESPN2)

10 v 21 - OKC v PHX 

22 v 13 - WAS v PHI

7 v 12 - HOU v IND (ESPN2) 

Then there would be nightly draws following each night of action. Group A teams would get their Feb 6 matchups the night of Feb 4, and Group B teams get their Feb 7 matchups the night of Feb 5. So on an so forth.

This gives coaching staffs one day to prep for the next opponent, and gives players a travel day, while still maintaining the excitement of a fast-paced tournament.
——

Imagine the story lines! The Bucks would likely join Group A, sticking the Lakers in a loaded Group B. Teams would have to decide whether to go all out for this, or give heavy minutes to bench guys. 

One potential positive is that the Cup gives downtrodden fan bases - like the Suns, Magic, or Pelicans - some hope for a trophy. 
One potential negative is if some teams decide to bench star players until the Quarterfinals (Spurs or Clippers anyone?)

The biggest positive for me would be the addition of a Cup Final with a Super Bowl / Champions League feeling to the NBA schedule. Imagine a Star-studded crowd in the All Star city to watch the “League Cup” Final.

In a regular game scenario, the one you pick vs the one you didn’t. Who you got winning?

Now these are arguably 2 of the most dominant forces we’ve seen in nba history and I’ve always wondered who people would take and what’s their reasoning to it. 

Imo I am most likely going with wilt over shaq. I feel like shaq wouldn’t be able to bully wilt in the post because he would be just as strong as shaq. He would also have a hard time trying to shoot over him, now I know there’s no numbers to prove how good of a shot blocker wilt was but from stories about him you could probably believe most the stuff you hear just by looking at everything else he was able to do. 

In my eyes wilts out rebounding shaq as well which will transfer into more buckets at the same time with wilt running the break off of the defensive board and getting some easy putbacks off of the offensive boards. 

I do see shaq lacking in the rebound department when he plays against great rebounders, one example is he played against Rodman 16x in his career with Rodman our rebounding shaq 13-3. So I can see wilt doing the same thing if they ever matched up. 

And lastly wilts ability to be able to play out the whole game without going on the bench. He can play the whole 48 minutes of the game and keep up his high production. I give him the edge in the speed category especially going coast to coast because wilt was freakishly athletic for his size. 

Not taking anything away from shaq, just my personal opinion.

I gotta admit, I came into this list with low expectations, expecting to make myself mad due to ESPN's tendency to sometimes throw hot takes out there just to stir-up controversy, and though this list is not perfect, and it has some major flaws that I will discuss here in a second, it's pretty alright for a ranking list, which is incredibly hard to pull-off in sports. There's also a fair amount of little stuff that I see and I don't love, but that comes-off as not a big deal to me that, for example, Dikembe Mutombo is one spot higher than Artis Gilmore, even though I wouldn't have that on my list.

I initially wasn't a big fan of where Tony Parker was placed, ahead of players that benefitted much less from the system in which TP played, but he was still a 4-time All-NBA player, 6-time All-Star, and a (debatable) Finals MVP. The thing that really made me mad about this list was where Manu Ginobili was placed. Don't get me wrong, I love Manu, and he's one of the reasons that I basketball overtook baseball as my favorite sports, but putting him above TP is criminal in its own right, and putting him above *3 different* MVP winners is insane to me. Manu was a starting-caliber player for most of his career, and he was an All-Star the two seasons that he was a consistent starter, but I don't think that he was ever elite. He did come off of the bench for most of his career somewhat unfairly and lasted a very long time in the league, but I believe that if Manu was a starter for his entire career, he would not have lasted nearly as long. He did make an All-NBA team coming primarily off of the bench, a very impressive feat, and was one of the best sixth mans of all-time, but if you expand his numbers to look at them per 36 minutes where he would have played elite starter minutes, he was not deserving for his spot in these rankings. He was a very good passer as a combo-guard, and he was a good defensive player and shooter, but he was never other-wordly efficient or seemingly like a ""star.""

For a little bit less than a decade, he averaged around 20-5-5-1.5, which are very good numbers, especially for the length at which he put them up, but I think even Spurs fans can agree that he wasn't a star, and that he probably ended-up having a better career due to his coming off the bench. Some guys are just better off the bench (Lou Williams) because it allows them to use their energy, one of Manu's best traits, as an advantage against tired starters, as well as being a level-above the rest of the bench players. When he started, he averaged only around 17-4.5-4.5 with about a steal and a half a game. Don't get me wrong, those are good numbers, but he was the third option in the best-run system in NBA history who benefitted greatly from coming off of the bench.

This is a long-winded way of saying that Manu was never a star-level player who was probably wasn't even the second-best player on his team, and to rank him number 58 above 3 different guys who won an MVP, two of which were either the best or tied for the best player on at least one championship team in Cowens and Willis Reed. Manu is not a guy that I feel confident about dropping onto a team like the Magic, my usual example of a team that needs a scoring threat at the guard position, and making them a title contender. Even though guys like Reed and Cowens played in the weakest era of basketball in the 70s, they were able to lead or co-lead a team to a championship in their era, and I don't think that Manu could.

For a more modern comparison for how they ranked Manu, Pau Gasol is lower than him. If I gave you the choice between having 15 years of good Pau, or 13 years of good Manu (I'm excluding the years where I think they really fell-off), who would you choose? I'm choosing Pau all day, every day. I know this is just one guy's opinion, and that Manu was older at this time, but this article ([http://thehoopdoctors.com/2010/12/top-25-nba-player-rankings-for-2010/](http://thehoopdoctors.com/2010/12/top-25-nba-player-rankings-for-2010/)) has Pau Gasol as the 8th best player in the NBA before the 2010-11 season. I don't think Manu was ever even in discussion as a top-10 player in the league, and I think that's what separates him from the players that ESPN said that he was better than.

I'll again emphasize that I love Manu and think that without him, the Spurs don't have the dynasty that they did, but I think that saying that he was in the same conversation of Vince Carter, Paul Pierce, and Clyde Drexler in terms of all-time ranking is crazy to me. There are other things in this article that I didn't love, as I think that T-Mac is too high for how short his prime was and his lack of playoff ability, and I think that Wes Unseld is only as high as he is because he undeservedly won the MVP in his rookie year and peaked in that year.

Micheal Jordan is one of, if not the greatest player of all time. He has the most amount of points per game in NBA history 30.1 , 1 of 4 players to be in the top 20 highest PPG seasons multiple times and has the 2nd most in that group with 3. He was a 10 time scoring champion, 5 time MVP, 14 time all star, 11 time 10 time 1st team all NBA 1 time second team all nba. 1st 40 year old to score more than 40. He has more accolades but I want to stick with scoring related. 

His 3 seasons under Doug Collins the offensive system was “Give the ball to Mike”. He was known more as a motivator than an X&amp;amp;amp;Os coach and he wasn’t a good motivator in Chicago to anyone but Jordan. According to a Chicago tribune article “multiple players were angered and frustrated by playing for Collins.” “Doug Collins claimed he didn’t want Oakley and didn’t utilize his replacement Bill Cartwright “ “Had former 1st pick Will Purdue glued to the bench”. He played Michael over 40 minutes a game each season. Micheal Jordan in his 3 years of being the offensive system with no utilized help from 1987-1989 had **34.9/6.2/6.2**. 

His 2 best scoring years were:

###1986-1987 **37.1/5.2/4.6** 
5th highest scoring season all  time

###1987-1988 **35/5.5/5.9** 
MVP, 10th highest scoring season all time, 1 of 2 players to have multiple seasons in the top 10 PPG all time.

The 1988-1989 season was progressing 57 games in Jordan was the favorite to win the scoring title but the Bulls were not having the of success expected and were the 6th seed. Doug Collins in act of desperation, as he felt the front office was grooming Phil Jackson to replace him, took his offensive system of “give the ball to Mike” to its fullest extent and experimented making Micheal Jordan Point guard(like Mike D’Antoni would Later do with Janes Harden). His 1st game as Point Guard on 3/11/89 he had 15 assist , followed by 14, then 12 ... for the remainder of the season he averaged 

#30.4/10.7/9.2 

He was a nightly triple double threat. Prior to that he was averaging **33.4/7.6/6.9**. During that stretch he was the first person since Wilt Chamberlain to have seven consecutive triple doubles. He had the Team average 100+ points 16 straight times (common now but it was a big deal then).  

A huge contributor to this was having a **SINGLE** 3 point shooter playing with Jordan. Craig Hodges in between Jordan becoming point guard and Hodges getting injured he was shooting 5.1 threes a night shooting 59.7%, at the time which was insane given the Bulls Team shot 6.5.  

After Hodges injury Jordan went from **12.5 to 9.4 assists** and started to score more from **26.7 to 32.9**, he was still a able and willing passer, he passed when he was doubled or when a teammate like was open but he had no other 3 point shooter to pass to. John paxson Who was a good career three point shooter was awful when Jordan became point Guard. He shot 14.3% on 1 attempt a game and the only other above average three point shooter that season was Brad Sellers who hardly attempted any .2 attempts.

You had rivals (at the time) praise Jordan as a point guard saying 

Clyde Drexler “everybody has to watch him with the ball. the other guys are free to roam, and their shooting percentages are going to soar. I think (Jordan) handles the ball better than magic. (Jordan) just makes everyone else better and when he gets used to that position...”

Dominique Wilkins “ so many people key on Michael but you’re usually going to have one or two guys open all the time. It makes them that much more effective. It depends how the other players respond to it, and they’ve responded well.”

Doc Rivers(not a rival but notable)“I don’t like it,  I think it’s terrible. It’s not fair”. “what he’s done is an incredible sacrifice. He was already carrying the team. To sacrifice shots and points, I’ve never seen a sacrifice like that. It’s just incredible. That tells you how much he wants to win. He doesn’t care who does it he just wants to win”.

##Why am I making a big deal about these early seasons under a mediocre coach?
**His age.** Doug Collins was Jordan’s coach from the ages of 22-25 . Most people consider NBA primes to be between 26-32 but he dropped his highest statistical averages before the age of 26. The reason? After 1989 Doug Collins was fired and Phil Jackson implemented the triangle offense in order for the team to succeed. Kobe Jordan and Phil Jackson talk about the triangle sacrifices individual stats for the sake of the team. 

I obviously cannot prove Jordan was anyone in physically in his prime then he was before Phil Jackson. I am inferring based off anecdotes from the last dance that said he put on 15 pounds muscle in the offseason after 1989-1990 at the age of 27. 15 more pound of muscle means he was stronger than he was in 1986-89. Despite his new strength he had he had the lowest points per game since sophomore season, when he could only play in limited minutes.

Jordan in the last dance said “He(Phil Jackson) was coming to take the ball out of my hands. Doug put the ball in my hands. Everybody has an opportunity to touch the ball, but I didn’t want Bill Cartwright to have the ball with five seconds left. That’s not an equal-opportunity offense. That’s B*** S***.”

So years Jordan was in his prime he was in a system that actively suppressed his stats and before he was in his “prime” he had a coach who couldn’t develop a system that would have played into Jordan’s Strengths, he just gave him the ball. Doug Collins lucked into something that Mike D’Antoni would use and take to the next level. Jordan becoming a Point guard and kicking it out to Hodges was the blueprint for James Harden becoming a point guard and kicking it out to shooters.

The spacing Harden had to drive would be maximized and the team would have tremendous success Under D’Antoni. The year before D’Antoni implemented his system was the Rockets were the 8th seed  lost to Golden state without Curry. They had just lost multiple players who contributed 18+ minutes in the offseason. The Rockets lost all star big man Dwight Howard, wild card Micheal Beasley, Terrance Jones Josh Smith  and Ty Lawson. On paper got worse replacing them with Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson, Nene, Sam Dekker and Troy Williams. The over/under on wins went down from last years Pre-season 56.5 in 2015-2016 to 44 in 2016-17 and they won 55 games going from 8th seed to 3rd while Harden had his best season of his career. Without sacrificing individual stats D’Antoni Developed a system that would lead to winning and ENHANCE stats. I’ll elaborate more on Harden later.  Let’s go into detail on Mike D’Antoni.

Mike D’Antoni is a offensive visionary who revolutionized the game and is responsible for the most prolific offenses in NBA history. Despite him being known for his seven seconds or less system, he also had one of the slowest paced teams in the 2018 season. Despite the fact that he was unwilling to adjust was always going to adapt to the times and have prolific revolutionary offenses on every team he’s been Head coach -the Lakers.(I’m crediting the 2012-2013 Knicks season to him.)

I am not going to pretend I could break down all of his coaching but a very basic summary of his coaching is I wish I was that smart and understood it fully.

Give the ball to your best guard and design the offense around him. Guards would often have their best statistical seasons under D’Antoni. Three point shooting was emphasized heavily size was not.

He was not scared to think outside the box and be unorthodox, Shawn Marion, PJ Tucker and Amare Stoudemire play(ed) an unconventional role for their type of player given the time(s). He would Favored defensive wings in place of traditional power forwards would play Power forwards at center. He went even further 2020 playing a tradition SF at center. 

He took advantages of the opportunity fast breaks would give him. The mid range shot isn’t emphasized The focus is drive to the paint or get a three point shot
Various of that included:
* heavy pick and roll to create mismatches to attack or kick it out to a shooter.
* Isolation with your best player and kick out to a shooter he could slow the game down lower amount of possessions while having A very efficient offense.
*”6 seconds or less” “Super small ball” “micro ball” fast breaks heavily emphasized isolation with your guards but in a different manner than what I listed before the emphasis is on a fast pace. No traditional Big men with defensive wings who can shoot in your front court.

Despite not winning a championship has had great team success. 
*His Suns won 50 or more games in four consecutive seasons and took the team to the Western conference finals. 
*He took the Knicks to the playoffs for the 2nd time in 10 years and continued to get them there for 3 straight years despite consistent injuries and trades that messed up continuity. The best Knicks season was when he left but Woodson was force to play D’Antoni system after Amare’s injury. Elements like heavy emphasis on three’s having a Wing play PF (Melo Novak) and a guard(JR off the bench) take control of the offense with heavy pick and rolls. Leading to the most successful Knicks Season in over a decades and it remain our best season 54 wins 2nd seed Unfortunately KG hurt Melo’s shoulder in round 1. The reason I credit this season D’Antoni is because Woodson didn’t like that offense didn’t run it the next year and hasn’t been a head coach since.
*The Rockets have won either 50 games or played at a 50 win pace(a 62.5% win/loss in 2020 which is about 51 wins) in all 4 seasons under Mike D’Antoni. They have 3 of the top 20 offensive rating   in NBA history). They have been to the WCF and went to a close game 7, where everything went wrong, to one of the greatest teams of all time.
* Mike D’Antoni teams were a top 3 seed  7 times
* Mike D’Antoni’s teams were the 1st seed 2 twice both with the best record in the League.

Mike D’Antoni and his system often results in the best statistical seasons for his best players. I’m going to compare 4 prime years before D’Antoni and the 4 years while he coached them to show his statistical impact. 

I’m not gonna go into the breakdown between Jeremy Lin and Raymond Felton‘s outlier years under D’Antoni’s system, Russell Westbrook Resurgence this year or Carmelo Anthony’s 2nd best statistical season in 2012-13 using D’Antoni Play style given the small sample size just going to mention it. On the other hand I cannot use Amare Stoudemire’s stats without D’Antoni as he basically had his entire prime coached under him.

##**Steve Nash**

Steve Nash had his best seasons under D’Antoni he became the first option and was given more responsibility in that offense then he had in his Dallas years.

His averages 4 year averages under Mike D’Antoni 

from 2004-2008 was 17.5/3.1/11.2

His 2 best seasons were 

##2005-6 18.8/4.2/10.5, 
became the 4th player to have a 50/40/90 season 5th time achieved, MVP, the NBA Assist leader.

##2006-7 18.6/3.1/11.6, 
became the 11th player to win multiple MVPs, the NBA assist leader.

2 time MVP was an all star all four years,  3 1st team all NBA and 1 2nd team all nba 3 time NBA assist leader. Became the 2 player to have multiple 50/40/90 with 2 in this time frame 

Steve Nash best 4 year averages before D’Antoni

from 2000-2004 was 16.5/3/7.8  

His best 2 seasons was 

##2001-2002 17.9/2.9/7.7 

##2002-2003 17.7/2.9/7.3

had 2 all star appearances with 2 3rd team all nba season.

Steve Nash went from a bubble all-star who Dallas felt they didn’t need to pay to one of the best point guards of all time and 2 time MVP under D’Antoni. Both Steve Nash and Mike D’Antoni both believe if Nash shot the ball more they probably win a championship. His points didn’t go up a great deal as he played a traditional point guard role but his assists increased from a already high 7.8’to 11.2.

His other major star he coached 

##**James Harden**

who had a dramatic shift in Play style (Harden was a elite mid range shooter under Mc’Hale) and had best statistical years.

His 4 year averages being coached by D’Antoni is not only the best of his career it’s one of the best in NBA history. 

##2016-2020 32.4/6.7/8.8##

With his best 2 statistical seasons 

##2018-19 36.1/6.6/7.5 
Largely responsible for the 6th best offense in NBA history just from his ISO’s, 7th best PPG season 1 of 3 players  in the top 7.

##2019-2020 34.4/6.4/7.4 
15th best PPG season 1 of 4 players to be in the top 20 PPG multiple times.

 *I don’t feel comfortable using this year given the circumstances and honestly I feel like he played better in his other years under D’Antoni but if I’m using it for the sample size &amp;amp;amp; that’s one of his best statistical year that’s what I’m using just wanted to put a disclaimer
 
He was A 1 time MVP a all star all 4 years under D’Antoni made 3 1st team all-NBA which is every year as 5/11/2020. 1 time NBA assist leader and 3 time scoring Champion(this year is unofficial as of now but 2nd place is almost 5 points behind him). Also had the 2nd most consecutive 30 point streak in NBA history. 

His 4 year averages before D’Antoni

From 2013-2016 27/5.4/6.6

His best 2 years 

##2015-2016(Dwightmare 2 electric boogaloo) 29/6.1/7.5

##2014-2015 27.4/5.7/7 

2 time All NBA first Team 1 time 3rd team All NBA all star all 4 years .

James harden prior to Mike D’Antoni was viewed as a top shooting guard in the league. He had some success and massive failures (13 turnovers, bad playoff performances. Most people didn’t consider him in the top 5 played in the league but was generally accepted as top 10. Was a prolific offense of player. James Harden under D’Antoni became a top “shooting guard” in history. The debate about Harden can become the 3rd best shooting guard of all time before he retires. Most people didn’t think Harden at point guard was going to work and thought Harden was going to be to selfish and they proved them wrong. Harden has had a few failures (games 6  San Antonio) but have been largely overblown averaging 29.8/5.9/6.8. He is responsible for the most amount of points generated in 2016-2017 and has some of the best regular seasons in NBA history. He has broken multiple records and put up jaw dropping stats.

James Harden is the most similar between Nash and Jordan. It’s interesting to compare given how they both were prolific scorers whose playmaking doesn’t get as much credit as it deserves in their early career. Then Started a new system went entering their prime. The Point Jordan experiment taken to a further extent under D’Antoni should yield a similar effects Harden did but first we need Factor in variables.

Are we assuming that Jordan basically is the same and modern basketball does not affect his playstyle? Or is he given today’s training with shooting coaches? Jordan got a lot of free throws but would he get more given the calls he didn’t get in that era?

I initially thought the pace was slower in the 1987-88 season but it’s about the same as today 101 possessions per game which is more or less where it’s at today. Which is why Harden has a higher points per possession Then Michael Jordan has despite having a lower offensive rating.

Something that we need to factor is how does spacing effect slashing mid range shooters. I looked at Russell Westbrook for the first time in years has shooters surrounded around him. His current season is his most effective yet despite having an awful start he is shooting 4% better than his previous career averages. He’s points are up 4.1 points from last year and is the most points he’s ever had as a second option. Westbrook had his assist go down but he’s also no longer the primary play maker him and James Harden share responsibility.
*Unfortunate small sample size but Westbrook was shooting an absurd 53.9% ever since the Covington trade, 52.9% since Capella has been out the rotation.

I didn’t want just one sample size to determine my opinion Giannis Antetokounmpo was the 2nd player I looked at. Mike Budenhoizer has similar style offense to Houston space the floor around a slasher. How was hired for the 2019 2020 season the year before that he had a coach that didn’t believe in shooting threes and a poorly constructed roster. Giannis FG% went up 4.9 points being surrounded by shooters unlike Westbrook he didn’t have a big increase in points with the production. His assist increased 1.1 points (18.7%) This year his field goal percentage is less then last years and his points went up but that can be attributed to Malcolm Brogdon a 50/40/90 shooter leaving the team and him shooting more lower percentage threes. His assist had went down to 5.8 bringing down the total increase in assists percentage to 18.1%

Derrick Rose is the final slasher I will use as a base line Derrick Rose is currently averaging his best field goal percentage since his 2009-2010 season and his season last year was his third best ever. After a disappointing 2017-2018 season Derrick Rose having a stretch big in Minnesota and this year on a team that shoots 36.7 as a team his FG% has gone up and this year he brought it 4.5 from 2017-2018, 3.6 better than his career averages. his assist per game is the second highest it’s ever been per 36 2 assists more than last year (26% increase)

Averaging out their jump in FG% 4.5% increase on average from a slasher being surrounded by shooters. 

Nash in 4 years had a 30.4% increase in assist Harden in 4 years had a 25% increase in assists Rose had a 26% increase in assist from last year Giannis 18.1% increase in assists from 2 years ago 24.88% increase in assists 

Michael Jordan averaged about 12 free-throw attempts in 1987 and had a more physical style of play then James Harden. I’d assumed he’d have more free throws but I can’t know for certain so I’m going to use his actual free throws per game and not per 36. I considered Jordan having league average shooting attempts and three-point percentage but that would be less efficient then just having those shots be inside the arc and he’d score less insane. 

Modern basketball usually requires less minutes being played the league leaders in minutes this season are averaging only a hair above 36 minutes.  So I’m going to use Jordans 1986-1987 and 1988-1989 per 36 then factor in the FG % increase to his attempts and add an extra point(s) for the Free throw per 36 removed. 1987 adjusted Jordan made 13.18 shots a game out of 25 attempts assuming they are all twos that’s 26.35 plus 10.2 FT made. Jordan’s assist per 36 in 1986-1987 was 4.1 adding a 24.88% increase in assists that brings his assist total 5.1

36.6/4.7/5.1

His 1989 season his per 36 averages are 29/7.2/7.2
Factoring the 4.5%!increase in percentage which would be a ungodly 59.3% from 11.8 shots made on 19.9 shots attempted assuming they are all twos that’s 23.6 + 8.3 FT made. 7.7 assists with an 24.88% increase is 9.6 assists

31.9/7.7/9.6

Averaging Jordan’s highest scoring season and highest assist season for him having a team surrounded by three point shooters would be

34.3/6.2/7.4.

Speculation on how good D’Antoni would make Jordan based off age and speculation James Harden had a 17.7% increase in scoring since Mike D’Antoni arrived in Houston. If Jordan had a similar increase for the ages of 27-31 that would be 40.37 or 40.4 points.

##*TLDR*

Jordan if we just took his best seasons and adjusted it to the modern NBA he’d shoot a better percentage play less minutes slightly less points and average more assists. However if we took Jordan and put them in a D’Antoni offense he’d average the most amount of points sans Wilt.

Jordan’s Stats Adjusted to D’Antoni system without getting better after 25.

Anyway, [here is the chart](https://i.imgur.com/O0Y12t8.png). Since I'm comparing 4 players here, the graph is a bit stacked, but we can manage to read a few things nicely.

Some Notes:
Here we are only looking at the offensive game in terms of scoring points. If we turn to the passing game, Jokic tops everyone. Misc category means ""Other points"".

Let's look at some interesting things here:

1. Anthony Davis is offensively the most versatile and better than the other listed players. He can score without the ball, through various Cutts in the offense, Pick and Roll action with LeBron and running the transition. In addition, Davis knows can play 1 on 1
either facing towards or away from the basket.

2. Embiid requires a lot of possessions in the Post-Ups. As many as 38% of his points come from Post Up. And even though he uses a lot of possessions, he's really efficient and scores 1.12 points per possession (in the post-up). This is the best number for players who have at least 1 post-up per game. Jokić is also very good in this segment and scores 1.06 points per possession and even has a slightly better shot percentage, but almost twice possessions less than Embiid.

3. KAT is an extremely good shooter, I would personally dare to say that he is even the best shooting center in a long, long time. I do not underestimate Jokić here, who is good with both threes and twos, as well as the other two guys, but Towns is simply on a different level. For the third season in a row, he is over 40% for 3 points, and this year he is shooting almost 8 of them per game. He is actually 17th in the entire league in the number of threes per game. In addition, KAT leads this quartet in both Pick-And-Roll and points after offensive rebounds.

4. Jokić does not stand out from any segment, that is, I have already praised him about the Post Up. Still he leads the others in the ""Off-Screen"" action, which is a little less relevant for the centers. But Jokić has another ability that I have already mentioned, and which cannot be seen in this graph. That is playmaking. And that is a very important and powerful skill. What can still be seen is that Jokic distributes his points to different actions, and is not a one-dimensional player.

The conclusion would be that Davis is currently the best scoring center in the league, KAT is by far the best shooter, while Embiid is a more traditional center, so to speak. Jokic, on the other hand, is a completely modern center that also has a diverse arsenal of attacking abilities.

And another very interesting question. What would Philly and Minny look like if they replaced KAT and Embiid?

On one hand, I do believe a player's ability to not succumb to pressure and handle the high-intensity moments of the game makes them better than the rest. However, there are proven superstars in the league who have tainted perceptions by the public because they don't sink in that game winner. You have players like Harden and Curry who many would dismiss over players like Dame or Kawhi because they aren't as known to hit those final shots. I'm not too stat savvy, but you have these 35 to high 40% shooters who miss regular shots in games that aren't game-deciding, but once you start missing shots at the final minute, people may start to turn on you. In fact, I can think of iconic moments from the top of my head with players such as Curry and Harden hitting incredibly clutch shots (Curry against OKC, Harden against GSW), yet it seems that people will still point out the fact that they don't show out these high pressure moments. In no way am I saying that people think Dame&gt;Curry or anything like that, but it's just something that came to mind when I think about how much people value the clutch gene. Honestly, once you're at that high-level allstar to superstar level, you should be expected to close out games with a bang and own up to the important moments. People miss shots, big deal. As long as if they dont go 2-15 in the final quarter, I don't see how we should discredit a part of someone's legacy.

He has 3 rings, two of which came on a super team, which btw underperformed and should have won at the very least 3 with ease. The 3-1 comeback is the most impressive thing he’s ever done, but it’s really not that crazy. He had kyrie who balled out to get the comeback, the warriors were injured, steph played bad and draymond was suspended, and the cavs had bron and kyrie both at their peaks, yes it is insanely impressive but it isn’t insane enough to put him in the goat debate. Lebron has 4 MVPs, which is impressive and matters, he also led the cavs to the finals in 07, but he didn’t lack help. He had big Z, who was still pretty solid in 07, and mo Williams, an all star and pretty good 2nd option to bron. Some people bring up 9 straight finals, but he did it with a super team, an amazing team, and a meh cavs team all in a consistently shit eastern conference that always had injuries like drose and IT. Lebron WAS a great defender, and then he gave up and only played defense when he wanted to. Let’s not forget that lebron IS A RING CHASER. You might call me a autistic dumbass for saying that, but he is. He joins 2 other mvp level players, and when they weren’t good enough anymore, he joined two other star players, and when that ended he went to LA knowing that multiple stars wanted to go there, AD, PG, Kawhi, so there’s that too. But the main question is, what has he done that puts him above players like Kobe, bird, magic, Kareem, and (if your an idiot) Jordan.

Looking at all time great lists recently got me thinking about what players could have been on those lists, had they played in a different era.

So, for instance, would Embiid have been a more elite big man, if he had played in a center-dominated era like the Hakeem/Shaq era? Or, conversely, would a guy like Shaq have eaten up a league like the modern NBA, with so many small ball lineups? Would Kobe have been closer to MJ, if he had played in the early 90's, where the illegal defence rules were more favourable to iso scorers? Or, would MJ have been even better now, in an era where less physical contact is allowed by defenders?

For me, the two what if scenarios that I like the best are Steve Nash and Reggie Miller, and what either of those guys would have looked like in the modern NBA.

Nash is partially responsible for what the current NBA looks like, but both him and D'Antoni have talked about how they think they failed to push the bar far enough, in terms of three point shooting. Nash never averaged more than 4.7 three point attempts per game. To put that in modern NBA terms, Giannis averaged 4.8 this season. Real three point shooters like Trae, Luka and Lillard were averaging over 9 attempts a game, and Harden was averaging 12.6.

People might not remember, but Nash was an absolutely elite three point shooter. In 18 years playing in the NBA, he averaged over 40% from three in 14 seasons. He is a career 42.8% three point shooter. To put that in modern NBA context, no one in the NBA this past season who averaged more than 16 points per game shot over 40% from three (Middleton was the highest scorer to get there with 41.8% on 15.5 ppg). And, Nash wasn't a spot up shooter. He was excellent at shooting threes off the bounce. Put him in a modern NBA offence, and he would be raining down threes off PnR action all day.

If you compare Nash to a guy like Steph, Steph is clearly the better three point shooter, but Nash is still an all-time great in that regard. But, Nash was a far better playmaker and passer. Steph is good, but Nash was a savant, and remains one of the best of all time, in that regard. Opponents will pressure Steph to stop him from taking those threes, but with a playmaker as gifted as Steve Nash, you would be forced to give him a decent amount of space to take away his drive, or else he is going to blow by his defender, collapse the defence, and find someone who is open from three, or hit a cutter for an easy dunk.

Nash generally falls into the 11-20 range for all time greats, but I really think that, if you put him into a modern NBA offence, with the green light to take 9-10 threes a game, he would have been in solid top 10 consideration. Put him in an elite system like the Warriors (in place of Steph), the Bucks (in Bledsoe's place), the Rockets (in Westbrook's place), or the Raptors (in Lowry's place), and he would have ripped apart every defence in the league and had a fist full of rings.

The other prime what if guy I had is Reggie Miller. Steph is the best shooter of all time, but I'm pretty sure that Reggie is a solid number 2. Reggie was great at hitting high degree of difficulty shots, and was also had ice water in his veins in high leverage moments, [as any Knicks fan can tell you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__29zDPQK8o). Despite taking high degree of difficulty shots, and being the primary focus of the opposing defence, he still shot over 40% from three for most of his prime, and finished his career as a 39.5% three point shooter, with a .614 TS%. But, Reggie played in an era where shooting 10 3's a game was totally unheard of. He warped defences with his shooting, but never averaged more than 6.6 three point attempts per game in his career. Put him in a modern NBA offence and encourage him to shoot 10 threes a game, and, no one in the NBA short of Steph would warp a defence the way Reggie would.

But, going beyond his shooting, Reggie Miller was also 6'7"", and was an excellent defender. Reggie was a two way guy, who would frustrate his opponent at both ends of the floor. He was an intense competitor who might have been the closest to beating the dynasty Bulls when his Pacers took them to game 7 in the ECF (88-83 game 7, where Reggie put up 22 points on 74.5% TS).

By the stats, Miller had 11 seasons where he topped the 10 win shares plateau (for reference, in the last full NBA season, only 11 guys topped the 10 win shares mark), and had two seasons that topped out above the 12 win shares mark (Lillard was at 12.1 last season, finishing 4th in the league). If you took Miller and put him in an modern NBA offence, on a high level team, with the green light to put up 10 threes a game, the guy would have devastated modern defences. Put him on a team with a strong supporting cast, and he would have sunk some memorable shots on the way to a pile of rings.

I got some helpful feedback in the comments, and I updated my analysis to look into some of the questions that were asked. In particular, I looked into how teams’ foul trouble strategies have changed over time, how teams performed when they had a player in foul trouble, and I used more seasons of data in my analysis. My full, updated analysis is below. I hope you all find it interesting!

I looked into some of the main reasons why an NBA team might take a player out who just got into foul trouble:

1. Players “have to be taken out” when they are in foul trouble
2. Players should be “protected” from the chance of fouling out
3. Players in foul trouble are less effective
4. The other team can take advantage of the player in foul trouble

In my analysis, I found that these reasons are not backed up by the data. I used the NBA standard definition of foul trouble, which is when a player has fouls equal to the quarter + 1. For example, if a player picks up their second foul in the first quarter, third foul in the second quarter, etc., then they are in foul trouble.

**Reason 1: Players “have to be taken out” when they are in foul trouble**

Commentators often say that players “have to be taken out” when they are in foul trouble. However, players don’t have to be taken out until they have six fouls, and not every team takes their players out when they are in foul trouble.

Teams have taken their players out less and less over the past nine seasons: [https://imgur.com/FCPdNL5](https://imgur.com/FCPdNL5). Players were taken out 45% of the time in the 2018-19 season, which is down from 63% in the 2010-11 season.

In the 2018-19 NBA season, the Grizzlies took their players out 65% of the time, while the Rockets only took their players out 23% of the time: [https://imgur.com/oB6rhXT](https://imgur.com/oB6rhXT). Teams were more likely to take their players out after their third foul in the second quarter (69%), and less likely to take them out after their fifth foul in the fourth quarter (20%).

Teams that usually took their players out in foul trouble still had several players foul out. They did not have significantly fewer players foul out than teams that usually left their players in.

**Reason 2: Players should be “protected” from the chance of fouling out**

In this section, I included players that averaged at least 25 minutes per game in the 2018-19 season. These players only fouled out 1.7% of the time. And on average, they fouled out after playing for 29.5 minutes, which was only 34 seconds less than their average playing time for games when they were not in foul trouble.

Players were also unlikely to foul out in any foul trouble situation: [https://imgur.com/5FpiXNm](https://imgur.com/5FpiXNm). Even with 5 fouls in the fourth quarter, players only fouled out 20.6% of the time.

However, teams limit their players’ minutes when they are in foul trouble, so these percentages would be higher if the player played their regular minutes. I created a probability model to estimate a player’s chance of fouling out, assuming that teams did not limit their players’ minutes. This table shows the probability of fouling out for a player who plays 30 minutes per game with an average foul rate: [https://imgur.com/5AIYJmZ](https://imgur.com/5AIYJmZ).

The current definition of foul trouble calls for taking players out when they have fouls equal to the quarter + 1. In the first quarter, this means players should be taken out when they have only a 13% chance of fouling out.

I think a better definition of foul trouble would be “when a player is more likely to foul out than to not foul out of the game.” Based on this table, a typical player is in foul trouble if they have 4 or 5 fouls in the first quarter or 5 fouls in the second or third quarter.

**Reason 3: Players in foul trouble are less effective**

The following table shows the stats per 100 possessions for players in foul trouble, compared to the stats for the same players when they were not in foul trouble: [https://imgur.com/NzWC3Ct](https://imgur.com/NzWC3Ct). I included the 2016-17, 2017-18, and 2018-19 NBA seasons in my data. I also controlled for whether a team was in the penalty, because foul trouble is more likely to occur at the end of the quarter, and that is when a team is more likely to be in the penalty.

Most of the players' stats were similar, but a few stats jump out. The biggest difference is that players had significantly fewer fouls when they were in foul trouble (-40%). I think this can be explained by two effects:

1. Players played less aggressive defense when they were in foul trouble. Players had fewer blocks (-16%), so they probably tried to avoid situations when they would commit fouls.
2. Refs tried to even out the number of fouls called on each team and player. After the refs have called fouls on one player, they may be more likely to call fouls in that player’s favor in order to be fair. Players in foul trouble drew more fouls (+20%), so it is possible that some of these fouls would have been called against the player if they were not in foul trouble.

Overall, players performed slightly better on the offensive end when they were in foul trouble. They scored more points (+4%) and had a higher shooting percentage (+1%). They had fewer assists (-6%) and turnovers (-5%), so players seemed to be more focused on scoring when they were in foul trouble. They also shot significantly more free throws (+15%), which is because they drew more fouls.

On the defensive end, players were much less likely to commit fouls (-40%) and had fewer blocks (-16%). Players had the same number of steals (+0%). Despite the player in foul trouble seeming to play less aggressively, the team’s defense did not drop off. The other team actually had a lower shooting percentage when my team had a player in foul trouble.

**Reason 4: The other team can take advantage of the player in foul trouble**

I looked at how teams fared when they had a player in foul trouble: [https://imgur.com/1O0cuta](https://imgur.com/1O0cuta). I included data from the 2016-17, 2017-18, and 2018-19 NBA seasons. The expected columns are based on how teams performed when they did not have a player in foul trouble. I controlled for the opposing team, because better teams were more likely to get the opposing players in foul trouble. I also controlled for whether the team was in the penalty, because teams scored more points and shot more free throws when they were in the penalty.

Overall, teams in foul trouble outscored the other team by 0.8 points per 100 possessions. They shot 2.7 more free throws per 100 possessions, and they had a slightly higher shooting percentage.

It is interesting to compare how teams performed when they had a player in foul trouble, compared to when they did not have a player in foul trouble:

1. ***Teams had lower shooting percentages when the other team had a player in foul trouble.***

Instead of being able to take advantage of the player in foul trouble, teams were actually less efficient. Teams had lower shooting percentages in each of the 2016-17, 2017-18, and 2018-19 seasons.

2. ***Teams shot 12% more free throws when they had a player in foul trouble, and they shot 14% fewer free throws when the other team had a player in foul trouble.***

Some of this difference can be explained by refs trying to even out the fouls called on each team. If one team has a player in foul trouble, then that team has likely been called for more fouls, and refs may be more likely to call fouls on the other team. However, this effect doesn’t explain the entire difference. When teams had players in foul trouble, refs were even more likely to call fouls on the other team and less likely to call fouls on their team.

These results are both pretty surprising, but they were also found in a dissertation on foul trouble: [dissertation](https://knowledge.uchicago.edu/record/355/files/Walco_uchicago_0330D_14367.pdf) (page 31 of the paper, or 38 in the pdf).

**Takeaways**

* NBA teams often take their players out when they pick up a foul that puts them in foul trouble. However, players with fouls equal to the quarter + 1 are unlikely to foul out.
* A better definition of foul trouble would be when players have at least a 50% chance of fouling out. This would be when players have 4 or 5 fouls in the first quarter, or 5 fouls in the second or third quarter.
* Leaving a player in when they were in foul trouble had a couple of advantages:
   * By keeping the player in the game instead of replacing them with a sub, the team got more minutes from their best players.
   * Players in foul trouble had more favorable foul calls. Referees were more likely to call fouls on the opposing player instead of the player in foul trouble.

Glossed over in all of the Jordan documentary is his excellent supporting cast. I’ll take rebounding and defense MVP Rodman all day over Dwayne Wade as a playing partner. As I would also take the ridiculous Pau Gasol and Lamar Odom and Andrew Bynum Kobe played with. Michael also had a top-4 co-player in Pippen and perennial decent bigs and supporting cast players. 

And Michael had very good, extremely experienced coaching in Phil Jackson.

LeBron had none of that. None. Wade and him played the same position and Bosh was a stretch 4 that meshed with the off-ball player. That team was good but nothing compared to a constructed Bulls or Lakers team where we have seen LeBron’s two peers MJ and Kobe succeed. 

MJ couldn’t beat the Pistons with teams still better than LeBron’s cavs teams. 

LeBron may be slightly behind Jordan on longevity of individual isolation scoring and overall skillset eliteness but a full step ahead in elevating bad teams to elite records and can play all five positions and is inherently more team-positive and flexible. 

LeBron is the better rebounder and post defender which are more unique skillsets than scoring. Michael was remarkably good at getting clutch rebounds and blocks but we all know LeBron is just bigger and amazing there. 

LeBron passes more which means more team energy/chemistry building/cutting being respected and that has value over even an extremely efficient ball dominant player like MJ. 

The 2016 championship over the GOAT warriors team pushes LeBron just a tiny bit over Michael’s different elitisms, whose most intimidating team playoff win was over the George Karl coached Sonics.

Jordan has all of the memorable moments of the retirement, the game-winners, all of that, and Kareem was a much maligned guy for being somewhat of an introvert and seeming stand-off-ish, as well as being a Muslim athlete.

If you take a minute to go down the Kareem statistical rabbit hole, you can find some crazy stuff. Except for the 1977-78 season in which he only played 65 games, Kareem made the all-star team for every year that he played, which I'll remind you, was until he was 42. That one season that he ""only"" played 65 games was the lowest of his career, and he still averaged 25-13 with 3 BPG when he did play. I will say, the last two-ish years of Kareem's all-star candidacy were likely a ""it's probably his last year, let's get Kareem one last go"" in a Dirk type thing, but from when he was a rookie in 69-70 to 85-86, which was also his last of 15, yes 15, straight All-NBA teams, he never averaged below 21.5 PPG, and though his rebounding dipped in later years as his athleticism predictably dipped, through his rookie year into 84-85, he averaged between 7.5 and 17 RPG. Though he played in probably the most watered-down era of basketball in history, as the NBA was rapidly adding expansion teams and working against the ABA in his prime, which brought the level of competition down (the cocaine use didn't help either), Kareem probably deserved to win more like 10 MVPs if it wasn't for his not being liked and the usual ""we need a new story other than 'Kareem wins 8th MVP,' so let's give it to some underserving guy like Bob McAdoo (no disrespect, McAdoo and Bob Lanier are probably two of the most disrespected legends ever, but c'mon).""

Really, just look at his basketball reference page (link here - [https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/abdulka01.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/abdulka01.html)), it's just full of absolutely absurd numbers beyond just ""all-time leading scorer"" and the commonly-known stats, he just had similar seasons that never really had the ""wow"" factor that other great seasons had, as well as playing in the worst era of basketball in NBA history other than like the 40s.

As an extra touch, he had the most unstoppable move ever with his skyhook (unless you count prime Shaq's ""body tf out of everybody cause I'm Shaq"" strategy as a move), and he was clutch, elevating to the moment in finals games, and never really getting credit for not really having a notable ""choke"" performance in his career.

You can point out that his Laker teams in his prime never won a championship without Magic in a diluted league, which is fair, but he also played with pretty much nobody that I can think of off the top of my head for his entire Lakers career up to that point. You could also argue that a not particularly athletic post-up center like Kareem would not be nearly as valuable today, which is true, but I don't think he should be penalized for capitalizing on what kind of player best fit the era of basketball that he played in, just like I don't think we should penalize guys like Greg Monroe for falling off a cliff even though he would've likely been a perennial all-star in the 80s and 90s, he just came at the wrong time to play basketball.

When people talk about how ""Larry Bird would've gotten destroyed by (insert athletic current-day scorer here),"" and how that makes him overrated as a player, I think that that's ignoring his actual game. He was one of the smartest forwards of all-time, using his lack of athleticism as an advantage by positioning his fairly large frame to get a lot of rebounds, and he was also one of the best passing forwards of all-time. If he played today, he might be better offensively, as he would be encouraged to shoot more than the max of 3 threes attempted per game that he shot at the peak of his career. He also was never a guy who was gonna beat you off-of his burst, and though I won't argue that defenders today are more athletic than they were in the 80s and that it would be tough for Larry to maintain his three-peat MVP level of dominance today, people write him off completely mainly because he dominated in a less-athletic era than today.

This writing-off happened in the 80s as well with the Pistons' ""Larry Bird would've been just another player had he been white"" comments, and though I believe that the NBA has gotten more athletic and skilled now with advance in technology, eating habits, and many other factors, saying that Larry can't hang in the discussion of all-time greats is just disrespectful.

Finally, with all of these dumb edits with Larry guarding Lebron or KD, he was never a particularly good defender, and he only got worse as his back problems flared-up fairly young for an NBA player. Overall, to say that Larry couldn't hang in today's NBA with his game as a shooting PF (I think he would've played more PF in today's game) who can also handle the ball and average around 8 APG is crazy to me, even if he's a step worse than he was in the 80s because of the improvement of competition in today's league.

In response to this, I have put down my own list of what I think are the most common definitions NBA fans use when they debate about the GOAT. The players mentioned under each definition are NOT who I think the GOAT should be. Rather, they are simply examples in order to better understand the definition and what they inherently reward and punish as a result of how they were phrased.

1. Earned the most accomplishments

Rewards: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar

Punishes: Kawhi Leonard

This definition rewards players who have accumulated the most amount of awards and recognitions throughout their careers. All-NBA teams, All-Star appearances, MVPs, etc. all add up to a great basketball resume. This benefits someone like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, whose ability to maintain such a high level of competence for as long as he did resulted in a basketball reference page that few can rival. 

However, this may prove unfair for players who have had shorter careers but whose peak can rival anyone else’s. A player like Kawhi Leonard, whose recent playoff successes and style have catapulted him to being compared to the likes of Michael Jordan, may lack the hardware and track record of most of his peers because of how late he blossomed and his propensity for load management. 

2. Greatest moments

Rewards: Kobe Bryant

Punishes: Moses Malone

Sports is fundamentally an emotional experience, despite the wave of analytics that has pervaded the conversation in our modern day. A reputation of a player like Kobe was built on such moments—from his countless game-winners to his final 60-point performance—and what mattered more than his efficiency (or the lack thereof) was how you felt watching him in the moment. Some players, despite being statistical darlings, never elicit the same type of feeling. Someone like Moses Malone seems to take a hit in this definition, who despite being one of the most prolific rebounders in the history of the NBA, never captured the public's imagination in the way this definition looks for. 

3. Most Diverse Skillset

Rewards: Kevin Garnett

Punishes: Reggie Miller

The objective of the game is to win and the more skills a player has in his arsenal, the more ways he can contribute to winning. Scoring is perhaps the most important part of basketball but nobody is exempt from going cold. This definition rewards players who can bring the most to a game, be it defense, rebounding, playmaking, etc. A player like Kevin Garnett came into the league possessing an incredibly unique skillset and found ways to impact the game beyond his scoring. On the other hand, some players may have developed a reputation (deservedly or not) as one-trick ponies, who despite doing what they do at an absolute elite level, are perceived to have fewer ways of contributing when their number is checked. An example of this archetype is Reggie Miller, who made his reputation as being one of the greatest three-point shooters of all time while also being one of the most clutch. Obviously, Miller is not as one-dimensional as sharpshooting specialists like Kyle Korver or JJ Reddick, but relative to the GOAT conversation, there are aspects of his game that the general public did not get to see as much. 

4. Most Unstoppable

Rewards: Shaquille O'Neal

Punishes: LeBron James

In contrast to having the most diverse skillset, this definition rewards player who could not be stopped. You knew what they were going to do every single time, but no game plan or scheme would truly prevent what was coming. One of the best examples of this is probably Shaquille O’Neal, whose reliance on strength and agility to dominate whoever was in the paint compensated for the fact that he virtually had no perimeter game (or even a mid-range game) to speak of. And yet, what was the point for him trying to get crafty with his dribbling if he could just plow through everyone in sight?

The opposite side of this argument is someone like LeBron James. Now, obviously James is an incredible talent, probably the most versatile player in the history of the game. However, this versatility can be framed as a weakness in a very constricted sense, where the plethora of options he has in his command can ironically be detrimental. The worst version of a gunner like Kobe is shooting his team out of the game. Meanwhile, the worst version of LeBron is him “overthinking the chess match” to the point of indecision.

5. Closest to the Ideal

Rewards: Chris Paul

Punishes: Steph Curry

This definition prioritizes those whose style best resembles what we traditionally expect from the position, whether it be a center who dominates the paint and rebounds or a point guard who gets everyone involved. The best exemplar of the latter was Chris Paul. Nicknamed the Point God, Paul was able to achieve the right balance of elite scoring and playmaking that basketball traditionalists expect. 

Opposite to this are the players who have largely made their mark outside of these strict definitions, fundamentally changing how the game is played. The most recent example of which is Steph Curry, whose incredible range and off-ball gravity has changed how defense is played and redefined what constitutes a good shot from a bad shot. Critics however would ask how can he be considered the *best* point guard if he isn’t even a *true* point guard?

6. Best stats

Rewards: Wilt Chamberlain

Punishes: Steve Nash

Statistics do not tell the whole story and work better as supplements to what the eye perceives. However, the further we are from bygone eras, the more we rely on statistics to inform us of the greatness of these players. And when talking about statistics, nobody comes close to Wilt Chamberlain, whose eye-popping scoring records almost always dwarfs the next runner-up. If the purpose of the game is to score the most number of points, then a man who *averaged* 50 for a season is surely the best at playing it? Of course, the counterpoint to this line of thinking would be someone like Steve Nash, whose relatively mediocre stats can never fully encapsulate the effect he had on the game. Controlling the pace of the game, getting his teammates involved, and essentially being an offense unto himself, are some of Nash’s abilities that will never reflect in the box score but will nevertheless be things that cement his legacy for some. 

7. Won the Most Rings

Rewards: Bill Russell

Punishes: Jerry West

The championship is what everybody aims for at the end of the day and the person who played a prominent role to claim the most number probably has a good a shot as any in being considered the greatest of all time. Bill Russell’s eleven rings may never be rivalled, and that fact alone may have some pundits put him in a class of his own. However, not every player can play with the calibre of coaches and teammates that Russell was blessed with. There are some like Jerry West who became (in)famous for constantly losing in the Finals despite doing *everything* he possibly could to win. This was symbolized best when he was named the only Finals MVP to win the award from a losing team. How much can you really fault a guy for losing a game when it is a team sport at the end of the day? 

8. Greatest Floor-Raiser

Rewards: LeBron James

Punishes: Tim Duncan 

Basketball will always be a team game, and one person can never truly win it all. Still, there are some players who have shown the ability to drag the least amount of talent around him into winning situations by doing virtually everything for the team. No other player exemplifies this than LeBron James, whose 2007 Finals run began his reputation as someone who could leverage his versatility to compensate for any of his team’s deficiencies. There is only so much a player can achieve alone, but James may have done the most with the least.

However in this framework, a player like Tim Duncan would be punished quite a bit, even if it isn’t necessarily his fault. We never saw Duncan in a bad situation as he was always flanked with a stellar coach and supporting cast his whole career. But to his credit, he was likely the foundation that ensured that the team was always in a position to compete night in and night out. But some would find it difficult to see him in that light if they never saw him tested the way others have.

9. Overcame the greatest challenge

Rewards: Dirk Nowitzki

Punishes: Kevin Durant

Greatness must be tested in order for us to truly gauge what they are made of. And following that logic, shouldn’t the player who overcame the greatest challenge be considered for being one of the greatest? This definition will be biased towards those who played for underdogs and found a way to defeat the seemingly invincible foe. One of the biggest upsets in modern times is the Dallas Maverick’s 2011 run. Led by Dirk Nowitzki, the Mavs were able to defeat the Miami Heat, who employed the most villainized super team of the era. Meanwhile, many have criticized Kevin Durant for taking the “easy way out” when he moved from Oklahoma City Thunder to rival juggernaut Golden State Warriors, who were fresh off winning a record 73 wins. Some would even go as far to argue that KD’s two rings will always be less valuable than Dirk’s lone title.

10. Greatest Delta

Rewards: Michael Jordan

Punishes: Larry Bird, Magic Johnson

It is impossible to compare players across eras because of all the hypotheticals that one must consider in order to do so. Every era has its best player but how can you objectively compare each of these best players while accounting for pace adjustments, the analytics boom, hand-checking rules, among other things? Hence, this definition looks more at who had the biggest gap (or the delta) between the best player of an era and the rest of the competition. Jordan had a few rivals back in his day including Charles Barkley, Clyde Drexler, Karl Malone, among other greats. However, none of them could truly challenge him for the throne in their time. This is in contrast with the 80s era where both Larry Bird and Magic Johnson duked it out for supremacy. One could argue that it was exactly this rivalry which elevated their game to greater heights. But unfortunately, this definition punishes them for being unable to separate themselves from one another to settle the debate once and for all.

Obviously, the answer to the GOAT conversation will always involve a combination of all these definitions in some order or ratio.

Maybe compared to guys like Zion and Ja who are future All-NBA level players at least, yea, he's not as good, but he's still a very talented player. He's averaging about 14 a game, and yea, it's on only 40% efficiency, and yea, he only shoots 32% from three on only 3.5 attempts a game, but you have to think about how horribly built around R.J. this Knicks team is. R.J. is a good ball handler who has potential to be more of a passer than his 2.5 assists a game would suggest, as the Knicks refuse to use him properly. He isn't a very good shooter, so he needs at least above average spacing around him to thrive, and he needs the chance to be a pseudo-PG in that he's the primary or close to primary ball-handler, and he actually has a chance to run the offense. I know he hasn't proven just yet that he has the merit to completely build a team around him, but can we give the man more to work with than Taj Gibson and Elfrid Payton. I'm fine rolling Mitchell Robinson out there for his youth and potential, but you need shooters surrounding those two to be competent, and the Knicks have instead decided that playing (insert one of the 18 veteran, back-to-the-basket PFs on the Knicks roster) and Robinson plus Payton and even Frank Ntilikina is a good idea. After the Marcus Morris trade, a good trade for a rebuilding team with a valuable veteran, R.J. lost his only very good shooter and creator on offense on the team, and the lineup that he has played the most with is Payton - himself - Moe Harkless - Julius Randle - Taj Gibson. Ew. The fact that the Knicks refuse to give Robinson more of a shot to develop is criminal, and I really hope they make strides to help R.J. this offseason and don't turn this into a Magic - Victor Oladipo situation where it takes Oladipo (who, when healthy, I think is R.J.'s ceiling) and trades him away just a year before he takes the jump into stardom. My dream offseason for this Knicks team would be refraining from the bizarre temptation to prove that they're still a FA destination by trading assets for old CP3 and pursue Davis Bertans super hard. Going from Randle and Gibson to Bertans and Robinson would change Barrett's world, and even just drafting a SF or PG who can somewhat shoot and take some pressure off of R.J. on offense would be great. If the Knicks draft LaMelo, the popular pick for them, and sign Bertans and lets say a decent 3 and D SF, they could go from the aforementioned Harkless and Gibson mess to a lineup of LaMelo, Barrett, insert veteran SF who can shoot above 35% from three, Bertans, and Robinson. Of course, the Knicks are the Knicks, and they might just decide that DeMar DeRozan is their star of the future, but I hope that Steve Mills is a bit smarter than Phil Jackson or whoever the last few Knicks' GMs have been (though it's unclear whether it's just Dolan making all of the decisions regardless of positions in the front office). I think R.J. has a lot of potential as a scorer if he can get a better three point shot, and I think he can be like a more modern and valuable version of DeMar if he can also step-up his defense a bit, because he's big enough to be a solid defender.

Now I am not saying that LeBron at his peak was a bad defender nor do I want to give that implication. But his defense is definitely overrated to a degree by younger fans. 

Firstly, people tend to talk about his defense as if it were great on all-time scale. They'll rave about how he could guard any of the 5 positions, about how he would guard the opponent's best overall player, and how he didn't have a flaw defensively. While there is some truth to some of those points, they're either hyperbolized or just blatantly false.

To start this off, he could guard most many players from the 5 positions, but he would struggle with quicker, shiftier guards, powerful post players, and players who had a height or length advantage on him. His lateral quickness was above average but not elite so smaller and quicker guards such as Paul George, Tony Parker, and Jason Terry would occasionally beat him off the dribble or just remove him from the defensive picture with a quick first step or drive to the basket. 

Powerful post players such as Dwight Howard, Dirk Nowitzki, and David West among many players would constantly knock him off balance, back him down for deep post positioning, and throw him off with a series of fakes and counters for an easy hook shot or a nice little fadeaway. For as big and as strong as he was in Miami, his post defense certainly was nothing speical. 

And as for players with a height advantage such as Tim Duncan, Kevin Durant, Kevin Garnett, and Dirk Nowitzki could easily just shoot over him or take him to the post and rise up for a shot he had no hope of contesting. He also couldn't strip the ball away from guys like this because of the length disadvantage. 

And lastly, he did not guard the opponent's best player night-in and night-out. He was most effective roaming off the ball, protecting the rim from the weak side, and by playing that free safety role to perfection. But he did not guard the opposing team's best player consistently. And when he did, he was usually playing off of a teammate by rotating over to help or by forcing them into a double-team. 

I'm not trying to say he wasn't an elite defender. He definitely was. He finished top 5 in DPOY 4 times in a 5 season span. And although he had his flaws in terms of his defensive versatility, he was still insanely versatile. I only made this post because I gett annoyed with people hyperbolizing his defensive peak by applying blatantly false attributes to his defense.

I know they’re are gonna be a lot of different people in their lists because it’s hard to judge a player and to rank them with there not being a set criteria. So do you go by legacy, their impact on the game, stats, individual success, team success and so on and so on. 

Well anyways here’s my top ten and I can’t 100% confirm how I have the list set out because it changes each day.  


Kareem- one of the most accomplished players in not only the nba but basketball history. Coming in from day one and dominating for 20 years just goes to show how great he really is, even being the oldest fmvp ever at the age of 37. Now I know a lot of people put mj number 1 but Kareem has the same amount of rings as Jordan, he also has more points, rebounds, blocks and assists then Jordan not to mention 1 more mvp as well, while being dominant in 2 decades just goes to show how deserving he is for this top spot. 

MJ- one of the best to ever do it and imo the one with the best legacy. Come into the league and was arguably a top 10 player from his first season and only got better each season he played. Stopped a lot of great players from winning rings and actually making the 90s all about him. But there’s no need to keep going on as we all know his career. 

Lebron- the best all around player and imo the best player of all time when his career is said and done. Lebron came into the league and til this day is still dominating 17 years later just shows you how great he really is. To be able to stay at such a high level for this long is what makes him so great as well as making the people around him better. Even though he is probably the most scrutinised athlete of all time he never seems to let it get to him. I know a lot of people will throw dirt on his name and seem to always bring up his finals record and finals lose to the Mavericks but let me say this 2011 was dirks year no one was stopping him look who he beat to get to the finals, look how good his team played in the playoff run that year, if you are gonna hold this loss to lebron do the same to everyone he beat that year as well. 

Magic- the greatest pg of all time. Winning a title in his rookie year and even winning the fmvp while playing all 5 positions when Kareem say out injured, to play at such a high level in such a big game is amazing. Magic achieved so much in his career even though having such great players around you is such a hard thing to do. 5 rings, 3 fmvp and 3 mvps. With magic and bird saving basketball in the 80s just shows how much of an impact they both had on the sport and really shows how great they truely were

Duncan- the greatest pf of all time. Duncan gets slept on a lot for how great he was and most people wouldn’t rank him this high but he honestly deserves it, gets drafted and the spurs is his team wins a championship in his second season while being the fmvp. Now I know a lot of people say he had a great coach, he had great teammates but come on now it took popp a little bit to get his spurs offence going he wasn’t coaching like that his whole career. When he was mainly running the offence through Duncan playing in the post and either scoring or dishing it out to the open guy or to Robinson open under the basket once he started getting double teamed. Now when he entered the league Robinson wasn’t at his peak anymore from his injury being the reason Duncan took over and Parker and ginobili were great players but they mainly helped Duncan’s career last as long as it did. If they were on other teams would they have had the same impact they did with the spurs? And another reason he is so high is because he stopped lakers from 4 peating, he stopped pistons from going back to back and he stopped the heat from 3peating. Also being a great defender making 15x all defensive teams but never winning a dpoy is crazy. 

Bird- I honestly don’t like ranking him and magic on different levels because I feel like they were just as great as each other. But he is one of the greatest players do ever do it from his first season being a top 5 player in the league turning the Celtics franchise around to winning his first finals and being 2nd in the mvp voting for his 2nd 3rd and 4th season is crazy but then goes on to 3peat his mvps. If only he hadn’t had severe injuries that shortened his career. Now for someone to get you 24 10 and 6 just shows how all around he was and was a great passer as well as being one of the greatest shooters ever as well. 

Russell- I know he played in the early age of basketball but he revolutionised the game practically invented the fast break and showing defence wins games while beating one of the most dominant player of all time wilt multiple times. Mvp in his second season, later on 3peats his next mvps and to win 11 out of 13 seasons is crazy. Now I know a lot of people say there was only 8-9 teams in the league but that just shows you he did it against the best players in that era, to play in the nba you had to be a good player and like he said john Paxson ain’t hitting that shot against us, you know why coz he’d be sitting in the bleachers. Practically saying he wouldn’t of been good enough to play back then and even though that’s his opinion he does make a good point as only the best players were playing. 

Hakeem- the most skilled centre of all time could do it all. I really see hakeem being underrated as a player especially leading the rockets to a championship with no all stars on the team, he did the most with the least having a perfect season mvp dpoy fmvp and the ring. Not only just that but he was a great player from entering the league and not much people can say I beat Kareem, I beat David Robinson, I beat Ewing and I beat shaq. He beat these all time great centres in the finals it’s crazy and he is never really brought up as being one of the greats. 

Shaq- one of the best to do it in his era and was that good early in his career leading the magic to the finals even being selected to be in the top 50 all time basketball players in 1997 so early into his career is astonishing. Shaq is really slept on from early in his career with people only saying his prime was with the lakers when imo he was dominant from day one in the league. 

Wilt-  arguably the most dominant player of all time. Just look at his stats shit was crazy mvp in his rookie year all the records he holds and to be as athletic as he is at his size is just absolutely crazy. But my main reason for having him this low is for someone so dominant it didn’t really transfer into having much team success only having 2 rings and only having one finals mvp from them",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,85346,public,self,What is your top 10 all time greatest players?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/gh4rug/what_is_your_top_10_all_time_greatest_players/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm going to post this lineup and then give some thoughts behind it.

PG-Steve Nash

SG-Stephen Curry

SF-Kevin Durant

PF-Giannis Antetokounmpo

C-Shaquille O'Neal

I thought it would be interesting to see how Nash and Curry, two shooting distributors, would play together. There are differences in their games, but also a lot of similarities. The same goes for Giannis and Shaq with their paint dominance. And I've got Durant as the ultimate cheat code. 

Nash is considered by many to be both a top two distributor (behind Magic) and a top two shooter of all time (behind Curry). Those two aspects make him an offensive juggernaut, but an unselfish one. Much of the time, I want him playing his traditional point guard role. He has the court vision and velocity to hit the right man, and if left alone will punish the defense. Other times, when someone else is facilitating, he can run around with Curry on screens and get open for shots.

Curry is going to be playing more of a shooting guard role with this team. He can do some distributing, but his greatest value lies in warping the defense in his direction. I want him shooting as many threes as possible.

Durant is the most versatile scorer in history and also doesn't need the ball in his hands. He will be stationed on the perimeter as yet another knockdown three point threat, while also bringing his isolation game and cutting to bear when needed. Another player who can't be left alone.

Giannis is going to play some specific roles with this lineup. He will do some distributing, putting the aforementioned players in catch-and-shoot positions. He is going to be a devastating in the pick-and-roll, in both roles. But I really want him to be the cutter that the defense has to account for, but has no ability to slow down on his way to the basket. And I want him crashing the boards on missed shots from his teammates.

Shaq is the inverse gravity well, drawing defenders into the interior at the peril of leaving three of the greatest shooters ever and a cutting freight train open. He'll be receiving a lot of passes for easy buckets, and in the event he is covered up is great at passing back out to an open shooter or a charging Giannis. Shaq/Giannis lobs are going to be a thing. And he is a great rebounder.

This lineup is premised on a few notions.

At the end of the day, what matters is outscoring the other team. My offense is geared toward generating high percentage paint points and open-look threes for dead-eye shooters. This team is more offensively oriented as opposed to defensively oriented, but defensively I put an emphasis on team interior defense and rim protection as opposed to man perimeter defense. I want to put the opposing team in a hole and force them to shoot their way out, which they will struggle to do.

One that I've recently thought of involves three of the favorite teams; Portland, Orlando, and Utah.

Centerpiece of the trade:

Portland: CJ McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic for Rudy Gobert and Aaron Gordan

Utah: Rudy Gobert for Nikola Vucevic 

Orlando: Nikola Vucevic and Aaron Gordan for CJ McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic

Obviously a few picks and some other players might have to be thrown in to make the trade work salary wise or to get all three teams to agree, but I think this trade works nicely.

I could see a trade like this working this upcoming offseason. My reasoning is that all three teams have been stuck in mediocrity or worse for a while now, and this would spice things up for all three teams, while also helping fill some needs the teams might have.

Portland has been stuck in NBA purgatory for a while now, with their best showing coming last year when they got swept in the Western Conference Finals. It's clear that the trio of Dame, CJ, and Nurkic are not good enough to be elite. This trade allows them to swap their 2nd and 3rd best players for two players of similar value. Rudy Gobert is a DPOY rim protector, and I think Dame could help bring out his offensive game even more than he's been able to in Utah. Aaron Gordan would also give the team an athletic forward who can serve as a second or third offensive option on the team. 

Utah might have a promising future with Gobert and Mitchell, but questions recently have arose about their relationship. IF this is true, and Utah does decide to move Gobert, I think them receiving Vucevic is a decent offer they would consider. Vucevic is a great post scorer who has a vastly better offensive big game than Gobert. I think he would be a phenomenal 2nd option for Mitchell. He is also a decent rim protector, not on Goberts level obviously, but definitely serviceable.

Orlando is the worst team in this trade by a wide margin. Gordan has annually disappointed in his time here, and it is clear you can't have Vucevic be your number one option on offense. This trade gives them CJ who can be their number one option on offense, and whose defensive holes can be covered by Fultz, Issac, and his buddy from Portland, Nurkic. Speaking of Nurkic, Orlando also gets him in this trade. He can replace Vucevic so that Orlando doesn't have any holes at center.

Then I listened to Bill Simmons’ latest podcast with Chuck Klosterman and coincidentally they were talking about the evolution of basketball too, and one thing Chuck said really stood out to me

He said that of all the ways he would’ve guessed for basketball to evolve, guys becoming this much better at shooting wasn’t one of them. He assumed that it would’ve more or less stayed the same 

So it got me thinking about what the future of basketball could look like and I think I came up with something:

We’ve got the low post game.

We’ve got the mid post game.

Why not a *sky* post game? 


So maybe this sounds stupid and maybe it actually is stupid, but I’ve come up with rationale:

*Reason 1: It’s unguardable* 

Elite mid post scoring would still work today. Jordan’s and Kobe’s game would still be really effective in today’s game. There’s a misconception that the midrange game is dead because all the analytics nerds told them to stop taking it. That’s not true, they just told all the dudes who suck at midrange shots to stop taking these stupid, tough midrange shots that they’re not efficient at 

Kobe and Jordan were still efficient at it though

The appeal to their midrange game was that it was essentially an unguardable shot, just like the skyhook. So if a player can get off unguardable looks and be efficient at it, wouldn’t that be a big deal? And wouldn’t everyone wanna emulate that? 

Right now, what’s the go to move for a 3 point shooter with the final shot down 3? 

- Try and get an open look off a screen? Ok, not super easy unless you’ve got a great coach, most teams don’t 

- Try and dance a defender off with your handles? Mixed results, when they know you need to take a 3 it’s a lot easier to guard, see Steph vs Kevin love in the finals 

- Take what Paul George would dub a “bad shot”. Think Lillard vs OKC or Steph vs OKC. Maybe that’s just how things evolve and guys just go further and further back, but is that really the path we’re gonna take? Everyone’s gonna be shooting full court shots with the game on the line? 

No screw all that, learn a Sky post game and get an easy look for 3, don’t gotta worry about the defender, only worry about your own technique 


*Reason 2: Could become an even more efficient shot than a regular 3?* 

So here’s what I’m thinking: 

Kobe’s shot frequencies from 08–12

08-09: 21% of his shots came at the rim, 60% of his shots came from midrange 

09-10: 22% at rim, 59% from mid

10-11: 22% at rim, 58% from mid 

11-12: 19% at rim, 61 % mid, 

His free throw attempts were still pretty high during these years, averaged 7 free throws a game during this stretch. Jordan averaged a similar number once he began to rely on his post game more in the later 90s 

We know how Jordan and Kobe would draw fouls with constant fakes and getting their guy up in the air and crashing into them. I remember Gerald Henderson in a players tribune peace even talking about how he knew the exact move Kobe was gonna use on him, Kobe used it, and he still ended up getting faked out and fouling him 

If a player were able to replicate their post game from 3, couldn’t that become the most efficient offense in the NBA? They’d draw so many more fouls than the average 3 point shooter, part of what makes James Harden’s stepback so effective is that he can draw fouls with it

They’d still be able to use it to get to the rim just like Kobe and MJ did 

If they draw double teams, it’s gravity is drawing people away from the basket which is the best kind of gravity (sorry Shaq) 

And again if they can make the shot, it’s unguardable 


*Reason 3: Increase the longevity of smaller guys*

So we’ve got 3 pullup gods in the NBA right now, Lillard, Steph, and Harden 

What do their games look like when they’re old? 

Steph is still an offball shooting god, but do we know Lillard and Harden are? I’m pretty sure Harden isn’t, idk about Lillard 

Will Hardens game fall off a cliff if he loses a step and becomes unable to create space off the dribble as effectively? When does he shoot 3s then, does he finally start caring about off ball movement? 

Lillard can’t beat anyone with size, so what happens when he loses a step? No more on ball 3s? 

The sky post game is the answer. Don’t have to stress about how you’ll get open looks from 3, use your craft and old man strength to get efficient on ball looks from 3 

It’s what MJ and Kobe did when they lost a step, so why not these guys? 


*MY BEST CANDIDATES FOR TODAYS GAME TO LEARN THE SKY POST:*

Jokic: Big dude so has the power to launch from three while turning and fading. Has the touch and experience making bizarre shots. Needs all the help he can get to blow by people and get to the rim from the perimeter. Would kill teams passing out of it 

Kyrie: I just think he has the best post game out of any small dude in the league. He could post up other PGs on the perimeter and we know he’s a good shooter and hits nasty fadeaways already. He’s also the type of guy that would wanna invent something like this and a Kobe disciple 

Kawhi: Got the mid post down, not as intricate as Jordan or Kobe but he has it. He is also crazy strong and I think could extend the range out to 3, and has massive hands to make it easier too. A really good shooter in general too 

Demar Derozan: Idk why he’s not a good 3 point shooter. He’s a great midrange shooter, he’s a pretty good free throw shooter, and has good touch overall. Might be a mental block type thing. Throw him in the post beyond 3, let that muscle memory take over (he’s actually got a lot of the intricate footwork stuff down) and Bam we’ve got a redemption story. Imagine Derozan back on the raps meeting Kawhi and the clippers in the finals. Oh no game 7, 100-102 Raptors are down. Kawhi is on Derozan. How could he ever get a shot off vs that monster? Boom sky post 

Steph: dudes got crazy strong legs and core. Also the GOAT at literally every other kind of shooting. Why not this way? 

Jayson Tatum: Wants to be like Kobe and if he’s the one to invent it, we could call it the Shamrock Shake. Pretty cool huh? 

Luka: It’s something you can just picture him doing right? Luka’s just a shot maker and a big PG on offense and a basketball genius, seems like it’d work out 


*IS THIS AN UNREALISTIC SHOT* 

Maybe but so was every other shot before people started making them

For example:

Brooklyn Nets (7) have a record of 30-34 and are 9.5 GB.

Orlando Magic (8) have a record of 30-35 and are 10 GB.

While the Nets have a better winning percentage, they have played one less game than the Magic meaning that had the Nets played the same number of games as the Magic, there is a possibility that the Nets and Magic have had a tied record. The Magic beat the Nets in both their head-to-head matchups meaning that they have a very valid argument that they have a claim to the 7th seed. This could have big implications not only for the Nets and Magic, but also for the Bucks and Raptors if KD is back for the playoffs.

This scenario occurs a few more times in the standings where the seeding is ambiguous due to a difference in games played.

Armstrong, Horace Grant, Bill Cartwright or John Paxson in MJ's first three-peat, and guys like Rodman, Ron Harper, or Steve Kerr in the second run? I wasn't alive at the time that MJ was winning titles, so I can't give a super educated opinion on many of these guys, and I would especially appreciate if someone could give me some insight into how good Rodman actually was, as he seems to me that he was a bit overrated because of his gaudy rebounding numbers, which I have read that he stat-padded to a degree, and how good Jordan's supporting cast was in the 80s compared to teams like those deep Celtics and Pistons teams that they lost to consistently.

[This chart shows how often (relative to their peers) each foul was called by each referee.](https://imgur.com/ndCP8D7)


*** 

In today's NBA everything that can be tracked is tracked and stored somewhere in a database. But the one thing I've always wanted that doesnt seem to exist anywhere is a clearinghouse for data on NBA officials. What I mean by that is a place where you can find out which refs call which fouls more (or less) often than their peers. So I did it myself. 

Using play-by-play data from every game for the 2019-20 regular season I tallied every foul call and noted the referee who called it. In doing so, I was able to see exactly what I've always wondered: Do certain referees call certain fouls differently than their peers? 

[This chart](https://imgur.com/a/ggZdGsR) shows how often each referee who officiated at least 30 games called the eight most common types of fouls (technically, the ""kicked ball"" violation is among the eight most common fouls/violations, but a kicked ball is a little more cut and dry and not as interesting to look at so I swapped it for the defensive 3 seconds violation, which I believe is a little more telling of a referees foul calling tendencies). The higher the bar on the chart for the referee, the more fouls of that type they call relative to their peers. 

Note that the ""Personal Take"" fouls is just an intentional foul that you often see at the end of games. 

In order to create this chart what I had to do was convert the number of times a referee called a foul (on a per game basis) and convert it to a percentile so that I could show all 8 types of fouls on the same chart. That's because shooting and personal fouls are called a lot more often than Defensive Three Seconds. There are some downsides to showing the data this way (extreme outliers are not as obvious), but I think it's pretty informative overall. 

Note that the referees are sorted in this chart by their average percentile across all eight common fouls. Sean Wright (shown as ""S Wright"" for reasons that are explained in the methodology at the end) had an average percentile of 77, which was just above Scott Foster's average of 75. On the opposite end of the spectrum you have Brandon Adair and Ashley Moyer-Gleich who on average call fouls much more infrequently rate than their peers. 

I know that chart chart can be sort of tough to read, [so I also put together this album of 58 individual charts for the 58 refs. This give a little clearer picture for what percentile they score in.](https://imgur.com/a/25pQl6b)

Lastly, if you're more of a table-person, I'll post the data that way as well:

This data comes from the NBA's play-by-play data, which is pretty unhelpful and messy. Each play is accompanied by a description, which in the case of a foul includes the name of the official who made the call (e.g., ""[PHI] Embiid Foul: Loose Ball (1 PF) (S Foster)""). Unfortunately, it only includes the first initial and last name of the official and there are two officials that go by J. Goble (John Goble and Jacyn Goble), so I've excluded them from this analysis since I have no way of telling them apart.

I started out by calculating the total number of each foul called by each ref. But because some refs officiated upwards of 60 games while others officiated less than 10 I had to convert the total to a per game amount. In addition, in order to show different types of fouls on the same chart I standardized each foul on a 1 - 99 scale. So the referee that called the most shooting fouls per game would be ranked 99th and the ref that called the fewest shooting fouls per game would be rank 1st. The same goes for personal fouls, technical fouls, goaltending, and so on and so forth.

Lastly, even though there are more than two dozen types of fouls/violations I decided to show just the 8 most common ones. Technically ""Kicked ball violation"" is in the top 8 but I swapped it for Defensive 3 Seconds since it tends to be more subjective.

This chart was made in R with the help of ggplot2

Limitations
I'm sure referees have positions or different responsibilities like in the NFL so by nature of where a ref is positioned on the court they may be more likely to call certain types fouls. In addition, each crew has a head ref who I imagine is responsible for calling obvious fouls (like intentional fouls) that all three refs see.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,85113,public,self,[OC] How often every NBA official calls the most common fouls relative to their peers,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/gftb7b/oc_how_often_every_nba_official_calls_the_most/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,

My thought is that they would basically play the same as they do currently. They would just be shooting a lot of deep 2s where the 3-point like is. This would allow them to be valuable assets and their play style would eventually lead to the creation of the 3-point line to make the game more competitive.

I obviously prioritized fit over talent. Given the excess of offensive talent to choose from around the league, I decided to make my no.1 focus being that the team could legitimately switch all 5 positions, which is what we have here with LeBron and Giannis on opposite ends of the defense. With all the length too, I can’t honestly imagine anyone scoring on this team. Because of that priority, I ended up choosing PG over Curry, because Curry offers unmatched shooting and spacing, but would be an obvious weak link, which I didn’t think would offset his offense, only because he’s the difference between a literal perfect defense or not. As for the offensive end, almost everyone (except for Giannis) is a legit 3 level scorer (with KD, PG, and Kawhi obviously being significantly better shooters than LeBron), meaning that anyone can take advantage of any mismatch, whether it be a defender too small, large or weak, etc. Due to the versatility, you can basically run any offensive system (P&amp;R, drive and kick, off-ball motion, mismatch hunting, etc.)

Hey everyone - I broke down Shaq’s devastating drop-step move and technique, via the lens of biomechanics and sports science. Thanks to the mods for letting me post.

Here’s a table of contents, header (sub-headings):

\- 0:00 Intro

\- 0:32 The Drop-Step (deep post, positioning, creating contact, timing, the drop, drop-step footsie, 

\- 2:37 Counters (deep seal to middle hook, deep seal to feint to baseline hook, fooled by coverage adjustment, post feint into the spin, drop-step to reverse counter to the bank)

For those at work or the hard of hearing, I've transcribed subtitles on YouTube so sound isn't required.

Summary (will do my best without visuals): One of Shaq's most most effective moves was his drop-step. The first key underlying the drop-step was establishing deep post position (in the video, I'm using a clip of Shaq vs Scott Pollard) with his feet stacked to bias inside shoulder leverage and Pollard clearly protecting the middle attack due to Shaq's leverage point and the threat of his hook or two-step into the lane. Shaq would typically begin the move with 2-3 dribbles, driving his outer leg into the ground to provide thrust into the paint. Further, his shoulder would drive into the inside trunk of the defender to further bias the opponent into the paint and force them  to stabilize and root in the ground. After gathering his dribble, Shaq would feel contact and then spin off of it to go baseline. He was very balanced around midline and his upper and lower rotation were intricately synchronized, both optimizing his movement and rhythm (neuromuscular priming. As he swings around, a game of footsie takes place. Shaq's trying to get his foot and leg to hook around the defender but Pollard keeps a wide foot. However, his foot is displaced posteriorly which gives Shaq an angle. He uses his elbow and shoulder to generate more space while lowering his center of mass (trunk flexion and hip flexion) to optimize his balance while loading key muscles. In one motion, he plants the foot, dips, and then goes up for the dunk. In addition to the drop-step technique, Shaq had a vast array of counters that kept the defender guessing (in the video, I use four different counter examples). Cheers.

Well the first 4 games were all tight, and the winner flip-flopped each one, starting with Chicago ([series scores &amp; stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/1989-nba-eastern-conference-first-round-bulls-vs-cavaliers.html)). Game 5 was the final game since that's how long first-round series went back then, and it was the tightest one yet. Cleveland held a slim lead through 3-and-a-half quarters, but the Bulls fought back in the 4th to take the lead with a few minutes left, and then the two teams traded 1-point leads multiple times in the last 2 minutes ([video of the last few minutes - well worth watching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g2z1dLzTcM)), including a Jordan pull-up jumper with 6 seconds left to go up 99-98, then Craig Ehlo downing an acrobatic drive with 3 seconds left to re-take the lead for the Cavs 100-99.

This video was spurned by a topic Colin Cowherd talked about on his show. I have included a video of him talking about it.

Cowherd and I have some similarities so this hits me. He is from the Seattle are and I am from St. Louis area. Neither have teams but if our cities did have teams, we would be medium markets (St. Louis might even be a small market team). The biggest problem with the NBA is they've lost casual fans in small and medium markets. Cowherd hits on the reasons

The NFL has a sense of community. Deshean Watson and JJ Watt are tied to Houston. Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce are tied to Kansas City. Aaron Rodgers has been in Green Bay, Wisconsin of all cities for over a decade and has only appeared in one super bowl. In the NBA he would have left to a California team by now.

The NBA is a mercenary league. LeBron is a basketball player who happens to play in Los Angeles right now. Kevin Durant is a mercenary who happens to play in Brooklyn right now. Giannis might be a mercenary in a few years (if he leaves Milwaukee I'm not sure their market's basketball passion will ever recover).

Cowherd also mentions the fact that the NFL has many iconic brands. Cowboys, Packers, Saints (more recent one), Bears. He didn't include franchises like the Broncos, Steelers, Patriots but they're iconic too. Meanwhile, he argues the only iconic brand in the NBA is the Lakers and kinda the Celtics. Aside from that, only the players matter.

Why does the NFL have iconic franchises in small markets such as Green Bay or New Orleans? Do you think the NBA could ever achieve that?

Do you think the NFL sense of community is a major reason they are so popular? Do you think player mobility harms the NBA?

Cowherd had an excellent quote. ""The NBA is about the guy who is always ready to pack his bags"" and he's correct. The problem is they never pack their bags for the the middle or small markets so those places feel disengaged from the NBA while also feeling engaged with the NFL.

In summary, do you feel that the stability of star players that the NFL has is a major reason their league is more popular in America? Do you think player empowerment is bad for the future popularity of the NBA in American popularity? Should the NBA care about bridging the gap between the NFL and NBA in this country? In the late 90s the gap wasn't nearly as big as it is now.",False,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,85023,public,self,NFL vs NBA - a sense of community and why America prefers the NFL.

Thompson said in ""Above The Water,"" a short documentary  chronicling his rehab. 

Am I the only person who thinks like he does? I am not a Warriors fan so this isn't some fan-boying, but I still think he has a point once healthy.  They traded for Wiggins this season which IMO is slightly better than Barnes, worse on defense but better offensively. That puts their HEALTHY lineup at:

PG: Curry

SG: Thompson

SF: Wiggins

PF: Green

C: Looney

So that puts them at a bench and a 2015 Andrew Bogut(5.4/7/2.3 and great Defense) away from their 73 win team. As I said before I give a slight edge to Wiggins over Barnes and I think he has a chance to really grow into a good player in a better environment than the dysfunctional T-Wolves . Also they are going to have an extremely high pick(currently the first) this year which they can either use or flip for a defensive big and some role players which would also improve their team. There are obvious issues: they have aged, teams have figured out how to beat them(get a switch onto Curry, which perhaps a defensive center would help with) and the West has significantly improved(namely the Lakers and Clippers). I know that the 73-win bench was absolutely insane and I doubt they will ever have better depth. But I think we(fans and media) are both dismissing the dynasty as over too soon. I definitely don't think that they'll win 73 again but I could see some Conference Championships or maybe even another Title.

My main thoughts are:

1) Why are they completely written off, given the deep extent of injuries?

2) Has everyone forgotten that they had 73 wins BEFORE Durant and that the starters from that team are mostly intact?

3) This team might be one the first examples of an actually good team (with 2 All-Stars and 2-NBA All Defensive Team)that gets the first pick.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,84925,public,self,"""The[Warrior's] dynasty is over, they had a great run."" -Klay Thompson",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/gexad6/thewarriors_dynasty_is_over_they_had_a_great_run/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,True

With current global events causing many of us to be at home, we NBA fans are looking to re-watch some past games. That is why I wanted to rank the NBA Finals of the past decade in order to re-watchability.

&amp;#x200B;

1). 2010: Lakers (57-25) vs. Celtics (50-32), Lakers win 4-3

* The first series of the 2010s was an instant 7 game classic featuring two historic rival franchises. The Celtics were trying to win their second championship in three years behind their aging Big-3 while the Lakers, fresh off a title in 2009, were looking to repeat. This provided for great storylines and the series did not disappoint. The series was close with only Game 6 being decided by double-digits and Game 7 featured a comeback by the Lakers to win it. We had record breaking performances, such as Ray Allen's then-record 3s in a finals game in Game 2. The teams were as evenly matched as possible, resulting in an instant-classic series which was definitely the most entertaining of the decade.

2011: Mavericks (57-25) vs. Heat (58-24), Mavericks win 4-2

* Not many expected this series to be that entertaining because on one side you had the newly-formed Big 3 of the Heat going up against the Mavericks, who not many had expected to make the finals. Nevertheless, Games 2-4 were close nail-biters causing the series to be tied going into Game 5. The series featured 4th quarter heroics and incredible comebacks and finishes. The Mavericks also pulled off the upset, which was a surprising result to many. The close games alone put this second on the list, but not better than 2010 because there was not a game 7 and because Games 5 and 6 were not that close.

2013: Spurs (58-24) vs. Heat (66-16), Heat win 4-3

* This series featured perhaps the best version of the Heat's Big 3 going up against the Spurs with their ageing, but rejuvenated core. The Spurs were trying to return to the mountaintop to win their first title since 2007, while the Heat were trying to cap off an impressive regular season with their 2nd consecutive championship. Games 2-5 were not that close with each team trading blowout wins but Games 6 and 7, mostly Game 6, vaults this series into third place. Miami was all but down and out on their home floor. The trophy was being wheeled out onto the sidelines and the road locker room was being prepped for celebrations. Then a miracle finish for the Heat and a nightmare scenario for the Spurs happened, culminating in Ray Allen hitting perhaps the biggest shot in Finals history to tie the game. Overtime was also very close. Game 7 was another back and forth affair. The last 2 games alone make this series worthy of third place but the dull nature of the middle 4 games cannot push it past third place.

2016: Cavaliers (57-25) vs. Warriors (73-9) Cavaliers win 4-3

* As a Warriors fan, it pains me to revisit this series but I understand that for NBA fans, it was an entertaining one. This series featured the Warriors and Cavaliers in an NBA Finals rematch, with the Warriors trying to complete the greatest season in NBA history and the Cavaliers trying to pull off the upset. The first 6 games of the series were mostly blowouts. As we all know, the Warriors jumped out the the infamous 3-1 lead before a variety of events (Draymond Green's suspension for Game 5, Steph Curry's various injuries, Andre Iguodala's back injury, Andrew Bogut's knee injury) coupled with the transcendent play of Lebron and Kyrie willed the Cavaliers back to tie the series. Game 7 was a back and forth battle with the ending becoming the stuff of NBA folklore. Lebron had his legendary chasedown block and Kyrie hit one of the biggest shots in Finals history to seal the victory for Cleveland.  This series is not higher on the list because none of the games were particularly entertaining besides Game 7 from a neutral perspective. But the ending and the comeback place it fourth on the list. 

2012: Thunder (47-19) vs. Heat (46-20), Heat win 4-1

* This series was the culmination of a rushed lockout shorted season where only 66 regular season games were played. The Thunder were finals newcomers led by their young core of Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden while the Heat were trying to avenge their 2011 finals loss and win their first championship of the Big 3 era. Eventhough the series was over in 5, there were close contests in Games 2-4 that really turned the series in Miami's favor. The Thunder were just over matched from an experience standpoint. Unfortunately, it cannot rank higher than middle of the pack because it was still a short series. 

2015: Cavaliers (53-29) vs. Warriors (67-15), Warriors win 4-2

* This series is often forgotten because of what happened a year later but it was still an amazing series. You had the Cavaliers, who were back in the Finals with Lebron returning the past summer, against the Warriors, a team who had a magical regular season and had made it to the Finals. Games 1 and 2 both went to overtime and Games 3 and 5 were close until the end. Even without Kyrie and Love, the Cavaliers were able to have a 2-1 lead. Then the Warriors moved Andre Iguodala to the starting lineup and it basically changed the whole dynamic and shifted the momentum back to the Warriors. This series suffers from the fact that Cleveland was missing two of its stars, making the outcome essentially inevitable and not that fun for non-partial NBA fans. Nevertheless, if you can look past that, this series was very entertaining and close in many respects. 

2014: Spurs (62-20) vs. Heat (54-28), Spurs win 4-1

* This series featured a rematch of 2013 Finals in which the Heat pulled off an improbable victory. You had the revenge-hungry Spurs on one side and the ageing Heat on the other. The Spurs would exact their revenge by picking apart the Heat, pass by pass. The beautiful game of the Spurs was on full display and Miami was powerless against it. It ranks lower on this list because it was not really a close series and only basketball purists would have really enjoyed re-watching this series. 

2019: Raptors (58-24) vs. Warriors (57-25), Raptors win 4-2

* This is also another series that pains me to revisit as a Warriors fan, just because of the way it ended. On one side, you have the Kawhi Leonard led Raptors, who have finally made it out of the east after many past failures, against the Warriors who are in their 5th straight finals. The series had some close games such as Games 2, 5, and 6 but like 2015, featured a team hardly at full strength. Kevin Durant only played a quarter of Game 5 before tearing his Achilles and being ruled out of the series. Klay Thompson did not finish Game 2 and missed all of Game 3. In game 6, he was having a performance for the ages in an elimination game but went down with a Torn ACL in the 3rd quarter. At that point, everyone knew that the Raptors would win because the Warriors had lost 2 of their top 4 players for the series. This could have been an exciting matchup if  injuries did not take place, so it is ranked low on the list in terms of entertainment for the neutral NBA fan.

2017: Cavaliers (51-31) vs. Warriors (67-15), Warriors win 4-1

* This was perhaps the most hyped matchup of the 4 straight finals between the Cavaliers and the Warriors. The Cavaliers were coming off their improbable title the year prior and the Warriors had just added Kevin Durant into the mix. They held a combined record of 24-1 in the playoffs heading into this series. It was not a particularly close series, with the only close game being Game 3. The Cavaliers were just overwhelmed by that Warriors who were out for revenge for the year prior. As a Warriors fan, it was fun to relive this series because of how dominant that 2017 squad was but I can understand that neutral NBA fans may have preferred closer games.

2018: Cavaliers (50-32) vs. Warriors (58-24), Warriors win 4-0

* This series featured the 4th straight meeting between the Cavaliers and Warriors and it was the least entertaining of the four simply because it was a sweep and the games were not close. On one side, you had the Cavaliers who had traded Kyrie before the season started and had again traded half the roster at the trade deadline in an effort to remake the team around Lebron. On the other, you had the Warriors making their 4th straight finals after conquering the 65-win Rockets in a 7 game slugfest. Only game 1 was close, but JR Smith's infamous blunder doomed the Cavaliers and they never seemed to recover and there was never any doubt about who would win. You had record breaking performances, such as in Game 2 when Steph Curry broke Ray Allen's record for 3s in a Finals game with 9, but still, the games were not close. Even as a Warriors fan, I have to admit that this series was not that fun so I can only imagine the boredom by the rest of the league.

The question is, for every season there's a league-wide draft for that ONE season, including playoffs, with perfect foresight for the season. How many times is each given great selected the #1 overall pick. Of the times they're picked, how many times would that pick be unanimous (every GM would pick them), a majority pick (most GMs would pick them) or a plurality pick (they probably get picked by the most GMs, but there's a lot of dissension around who the pick is.) Unlike in a typical trade-machine situation, GMs have no loyalty to the players they had in the previous season (e.g., most GMs overvalue their players most of the time).

The title itself doesn't matter, but certainly what a player revealed about themselves in the course of winning or losing a title matters (e.g., Karl Malone's history of postseason disappearances almost certainly keeps him from ever being the #1 pick). 

The point is, you get that player for that season, but only for that season:

My first take on this is, starting with 1972, when the NBA and ABA started playing against each other in exhibitions. I suspect we'll refine this a bit. 

'72: Kareem (unanimous)

'18: Harden (plurality)
'19: Giannis (majority)
'20: incomplete.

So the leaderboard is: 
Jordan: 9 (3 unanimous)
Kareem: 6 (3 unanimous)
Lebron: 5 (4 unanimous)
Shaq: 4 (3 unanimous)
Magic, Bird: 3 (0 unanimous thanks to each other)
Moses, KD, Steph, Hakeem, Wade, Duncan: 2

The player most robbed by this is, I think, Ben Wallace, who never is the top pick but I think he was probably the most impactful player in the league for 2-3 seasons. Dirk's omission feels wrong but it's hard to put him at #1 in any one year.  Bird and Magic suffer by having their primes overlap so much. 

Aside from Kobe's absence (and I'm sure people will argue he'd be #1 in another year in there somewhere, but '09 is the obvious candidate year and everybody but Laker fans would have preferred LeBron at the time), the leaderboard is a pretty damn good who's who of the greatest of all time. Kobe, Harden, Malone, and Dirk are probably leaders is falling-just-short multiple years.

Pierce was a high school [McDonald's All-American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald%27s_All-American) and earned consensus first-team [All-America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Men%27s_Basketball_All-Americans) honors in his junior year at [Kansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Kansas). After being chosen by the [Boston Celtics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics) with the 10th overall pick in the [1998 NBA draft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_NBA_draft), Pierce spent the first 15 years of his career with Boston. Pierce's nickname, **""the Truth""**, was given to him by [Shaquille O'Neal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O%27Neal) in March 2001. He starred as captain of the Celtics, earning 10 [All-Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game) selections and becoming a four-time [All-NBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA) team member. Pierce combined with [Kevin Garnett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Garnett) and [Ray Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Allen) in 2007 to form a ""Big Three"" that led Boston to two [NBA Finals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals) and an [NBA championship in 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_NBA_Finals). Pierce was named [NBA Finals Most Valuable Player](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Russell_NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award) in 2008. Along with [Larry Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Bird) and [John Havlicek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Havlicek), Pierce is one of only three players to have scored more than 20,000 career points with the Celtics.

In July 2013, Pierce was traded to the [Brooklyn Nets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets) along with teammates Kevin Garnett and [Jason Terry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Terry). He signed with the [Washington Wizards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Wizards) as a free agent in 2014. After one season with the Wizards, Pierce signed with the [Los Angeles Clippers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers), reuniting him with former Celtics head coach [Doc Rivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Rivers). He spent two seasons with the Clippers before retiring in 2017.

I am a Bulls fan but I am excited to see what the Wizards can do in 2021. I believe they are at a breaking point. I believe they need to decide wether they am win with this core or need to blow it up. I could see a situation where they trade their 2020 pick and a player for a all star. (Maybe Rudy of things go south in Utah) or I could see where they dump Wall and Beal and go forth with Rui, T. Bryant, and their 2020 pick. I personally think they try to make a trade. Them not trading Bertans hints me in that direction. So if they follow that route who do they try and trade for?

For me it’s either 
Aaron Gordon 
Gallo
Rudy 
Or Drummond

His dunks and highlights will surely be missed. 

His accolades include:
8x all star
1x 2nd team all nba
1x 3rd team all nba
Slam dunk champion 
Olympic Gold Medalist 
3rd in games played
6th in 3PM

Vince Carter is arguably the best Raptors player ever. But, in the 7 seasons he played for them, the furthest he was able to take them was a game 7 of the second round. Where he infamously missed a game and series winning shot.

As the clear cut number one guy on a team, VC led the team to the playoffs 4/7 seasons. If you exclude his rookie year and a season he mostly missed due to injury, 4/5 isn’t bad at all. But, when you combine that with never moving past the second round, it’s not necessarily ideally for your number one option. 

After this he was traded to the Nets where he teamed up with Jason Kidd. These 5 season are undoubtedly the prime of his career playing with another future hall of famer. Yet, again, they never were able to make it pass the 2nd round. 

When Jason Kidd is traded and VC is once again asked to be the number one guy, the team struggles. Missing the playoffs twice as Vince’s prime starts to come to an end. 

Two seasons after Kidd is traded and two seasons of missing the playoffs, the Nets trade Vince carter to the Magic. This is where he has his best team success, finally making it his only  Conference finals appearance. Only to beaten by the Celtics in 6

Vince also sees his individual success start to diminish, averaging his lowest PPG since his injury shortened 4th year. This is start of a different career and role for Vince Carter. 

Vince Carter enters this decade 32 years old, and adapts a much different role. He becomes a very good role player, playing for 6 teams through the decade. In this journeyman part of his career, he still provides value to teams but never averages more than 15 PPG and less than 10 in five seasons. Which is to be expected given his age and willing adapting to lesser roles. 

So now comes the hard part. Where do you rank him? And at what position do you rank him? As the clear cut number one guy, he never led made it to the conference finals. As a role player, he never made it to the finals. He finished top 10 in MVP voting only once, being 10 in 2000. 

So if you rank as SG, surely MJ, Kobe, Ai, and Jerry West all rank above him. Is he better than George Gervin or Manu Ginobili? Was he ever as good as James Harden is right now? Is he better than his cousin Tracy Mcgrady?

If you rank him as a SF, LeBron, Bird, Durant, Pippen and Dr. J all rank above him. Is he better than Melo? Does Kawhi, who finally lead the Raptors to a championship, already rank above him? 

Vince Carter is undoubtedly a legend of the game. He has provided countless dunk and highlights. He’s had a very good career, one of great longevity. He’s for sure a hall of famer.

Basketball, or whatever sport you enjoy, can be a hobby or interest for some. But what is that compared to catastrophic worldwide events we are currently experiencing, such as the COVID-19 pandemic?

Adam Silver and league officials have set an example for those who dedicate time in their own lives to following the NBA. Silver did an admirable job of that by immediately postponing the season and allowing players to speak live on social media.

If in fact the 2019-20 season is lost due to this crisis, all we can do is speculate on questions such as: “Who would have made the Finals” or “who would have won the MVP award?”

All of the referenced players are Hall-of-Fame worthy in that sense for being able to accept that, “hey, there might actually not be a conclusion to this season but that’s okay because we are looking out for the best interest of everyone around the world.”

That leads me to league-wide subjects we can address as we look forward to the NBA eventually returning to action:

&amp;#x200B;

**Are one or both of the L.A. teams destined for greatness?**

LeBron James may be ineligible to win his fourth Larry O’Brien trophy in his 35-year-old season due to the suspension. That won’t tarnish his legacy but it clearly could take a toll on his quest for more championships. Although he has more mileage on him than any player in the league, it’s tough to imagine him at any age taking much less of a role.

For the Clippers, Kawhi Leonard could turn 29 before getting the opportunity to win a ring for his third franchise. Since he is still in the prime of his career, they might be more optimistic about their future than the Lakers are. Nevertheless, both teams have intentions of winning a championship and anything less would be a disappointment.

&amp;#x200B;

**How will this impact Giannis Antetokounmpo’s future in Milwaukee?**

Antetokounmpo was likely on his way to winning consecutive MVP awards as well as carrying his Bucks to the best record in the East (and possibly the league) once again. We know all too well though that the season is a marathon and is not always a strong indication of how the postseason will play out.

Assuming he doesn’t sign an extension, which he is eligible for, the Greek Freak can test free agency in the summer of 2021. Anything short of a championship could mean leaving Milwaukee for a larger market such as Golden State or L.A. This could very well end up being a climactic story-line in hindsight.

&amp;#x200B;

**Will the Rockets run out of patience anytime soon?**

If we’re talking about a team that has done everything in its power and has gotten so painfully close to putting itself over the top these last few years, it would absolutely have to be James Harden and the Rockets. It started in 2014-15 by losing to the championship Warriors team and then happened again three years later.

Only the second time, they actually pushed Golden State to the brink and who knows what would’ve happened had Chris Paul been healthy after Game 5? They say, “third time is the charm,” and with the two former MVPs in Harden and Russell Westbrook reunited, the Rockets’ last swing for the fences may be coming up shortly.

&amp;#x200B;

**How much longer does the Ben Simmons-Joel Embiid duo have?**

Simmons, 23 years old, and Embiid, 26 years old, are both young but that doesn’t necessarily mean the clock hasn’t started ticking for them to find playoff success sooner rather than later. In addition to that, both have missed their fair share of games and that’s probably not something the front office has simply written off or ignored.

The Sixers were a popular preseason pick to represent the Eastern Conference in the NBA Finals but Milwaukee was quick to change our thought process. The Al Horford acquisition hasn’t taken them to the next level. He’ll bring his game in the playoffs, but regardless, his age has showed there’s more to be desired for the team overall.

&amp;#x200B;

**What will the Nets’ roster look like outside of Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving for the 2020-21 season?**

For the 2020-21 season, the Nets are only behind Golden State and Philadelphia for total payroll. Keep in mind they still have to re-sign Joe Harris and all indications have pointed toward them doing just that. However, there have also been whispers around the league they could be looking for another established All-Star.

We know that when healthy, Durant is the clear-cut number one option and Irving is the indisputable complementary star. Caris LeVert and Spencer Dinwiddie have both proven they can handle a significant workload, one that could get the job done as a third star. It remains to be seen whether the Nets front office agrees with that.

&amp;#x200B;

**Do the Kawhi Leonard-less Raptors plan on still competing for championships?**

This might sound like an odd question since they do have the third-highest winning percentage in the league. However, it is important to note that Kyle Lowry is now 34 years old and soon won’t be capable of carrying the load he has these past several years. Pascal Siakam certainly figures to be the new future of the organization.

Toronto also has decisions to make on free agents Serge Ibaka and Fred VanVleet. Ibaka isn’t a dominant player but has showed the all-around skill-set needed to help the team remain in championship-level contention. VanVleet is sure to get a large contract this offseason but will it be with Toronto or another team?

&amp;#x200B;

**Are any changes ahead for the high altitude teams?**

I mean quite literally the high altitude teams – the Jazz and the Nuggets. Utah has won 61 percent of its games the past four years while Denver has won 62 percent of its games the past three years. Both teams have mastered the art of the regular season but also have combined for just three conference semifinal appearances last decade.

With the exception of Donovan Mitchell on his rookie contract, the Jazz has the majority of its core locked up, including two key contributors older than 30, Bojan Bogdanovic and Joe Ingles. The Nuggets have a younger core with Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray but questions have been raised about whether they need another star to contend.

&amp;#x200B;

**How great can the Jayson Tatum-Jaylen Brown duo become?**

Through all of their roster changes going back to the Isaiah Thomas-led team, the Celtics have always been high-functioning on the defensive side of the ball. That might be perhaps the most overlooked component of this team. Tatum and Brown are 22 and 23 years old respectively, but have found their way awfully quick.

Because Tatum and Kemba Walker are usually the ones to make flashier plays, Brown’s 20 points per game sometimes flies under the radar. The tandem isn’t just based off volume either; Brown and Tatum are both efficient and consistent. It’s difficult to imagine a ceiling for these guys as we curiously await their playoff emergence.

&amp;#x200B;

**Who isn’t a fan of Western Conference seeding implications?**

The second through seventh seeds in the Western Conference were only separated by 5.5 games. Just as the past few years have gone down until the last day of the season to determine seeding, this year was primed to be no different. It would have been thrilling to witness that once again as it’s almost like the playoffs before the playoffs.

There were two teams in particular that surprisingly made their way into the mix: the Mavs and the Thunder. While the Mavs may have lacked experience in the first round, Chris Paul and OKC would have been no pushover. If we are lucky enough to see the season resume at some point, this is still something we could encounter.

&amp;#x200B;

**Which players will we remember most when thinking back to this postponed season?**

I touched on this with the question above. However, one could also think back to when Zion Williamson and Ja Morant were rookies or when a 21-year-old Luka Doncic led the most efficient offense in NBA history.

With 0.9 seconds left and the Blazers trailing by 2, Lillard catches the ball off a sideline out-of-bounds (SLOB) and hits the series-ending 3 at the buzzer.  This was game 6 of their first-round series - May 2, 2014.  

I’d like to focus specifically on what Houston (under Coach McHale) did on this final play.  

1.  They guarded the inbounder.  

Ignoring the inbounder is admittedly a risk - one of the most famous shots of Robert Horry’s career was when he was the inbounder on a SLOB vs Detroit in the Finals. 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GjPgAQQst7U

 Horry passed it to Ginobili in the corner and the Pistons trapped him and Ginobili kicked it back to Horry for the game-winning 3.    But there was 9.5 seconds left on the clock at the start of that play, making the inbounder an obvious eventual threat.  

The defensive calculus on the Lillard play might be different.  With 0.9 seconds left, there’s no threat of the inbounder getting the ball back and scoring.  Rather than bothering the inbounder, that extra defender could’ve sagged and zoned up in space, prepared to double the catch.  

2.  They don’t switch any of the weak side screens.  

Lillard starts the play in the weak side corner.  It’s a common action to expect him to fly off a double screen and come toward the ball.  Yet the Rockets stay home, forcing Parsons to chase around both screens and trail the quicker Lillard on the play.  

Switching would be less problematic with so little time on the clock - even if it creates a bad matchup, there’s no time to beat a mismatch off the dribble.  

3.  Harden was on the floor.  

Harden is a good post-defender and one of the best offensive players in league history,
but this seems like a bad time to have him on the floor.  It’s a defensive possession only, and one that is unlikely to yield a post up for anyone other than Aldridge (guarded by Dwight).

Their usage has been increasing each year, and this year they are the leaders
of the Celtics' team in that aspect, along with veterans Hayward and Walker. However, unlike the latter two, Tatum and Brown are only 21 and 23 years old, respectively. Given that forwards are the centerpieces in most NBA teams, it seems like Celtics have a solid foundation for the future.

Jayson has emerged big time this season, earning first All-Star appearance with his
great performances, and he kept it going even after the All-Star break.
He capped off amazing February finishing with 30.7 points per game while averaging 49.4/48.1/76.9 shooting splits. That was enough to earn him his first Player of the Month award.

Jaylen wasn't far behind him, he averaged 21.8 points per game, with a bit worse percentages. But both of them picked it up big time with Kemba missing some time.

With all this in mind, how do they fit along with one another?

## Look at Shot Charts

[Tatum](https://i.imgur.com/geeb1TE.png) has ramped up the number of three-pointers this season, he almost doubled
the attempts per game (3.9 to 7.1), while even improving 3pt% by a little.

The thing that is interesting with Jayson is that he creates 55% of his three-point makes by himself (that isn't really visible on the shot chart, but it is useful info).

[Brown](https://i.imgur.com/s2yCE9f.png) on the other hand, is more focused on the paint and restricted area. However he isn't too shabby when it comes to three-pointers. Most of his triples come from corners, that's because he often defaults to spot up role in offense (more on that later). Brown excels in that role shooting almost 50% from both corners. But Jaylen is extremely efficient
when shooting 2 pointers, that percentage stands at 55.2%.


## Look at Scoring Based on Play Types

To compare their performance based on play types, I created a [Radar Chart](https://i.imgur.com/w7RoV5V.png). Or Spider
Chart, whatever name you like more. Anyway on this chart you can nicely see the profile of both of these players.

Tatum fits in the role of ""The Guy"" for the Celtics. Most of his points come from Isolation and Pick and Roll (where he is in the role of Ball handler). Tatum also leads the whole team in isolation points, however, the focus in Celtics isn't on isolation. The focus for the is Pick and Roll action, which is a basic type of play installed in their motion offense. The team leader in that segment is of course Kemba, but the fact that Tatum is averaging 6 points per game tells that he is very capable of running the pick and roll.

Jaylen Brown scores most of his points while spotting up. That number is a bit bigger than expected, but the fact that 88% of his three point makes is assisted explains it. And when needed, Brown can get near the hoop by either posting up, or driving to the hoop.

## Look at Scoring based on Tracking data

Once again we have another [Spider/Radar chart](https://i.imgur.com/rO1JfRn.png).

So this chart is based on ""Tracking"" data, as it says on [stats.nba.com](https://stats.nba.com/). It's pretty similar to previous chart and previous data but it gives a bit of a different look.

However, it is weird that Brown doesn't have 6 points per game in ""Catch and Shoot"" segment, because that is the amount of point he averages in ""Spot Up"" plays. So I guess that either tracking data has some errors (because this is automatically generated as far as I know) or the data based on plays has some issues. Or maybe some of the ""Spot Up""  points went to ""Pull Up Points"".

What we CAN see here is that Tatum pretty much evenly distributes the points that he created on Drives and Pull ups. And Brown tends to attack the rim more. So basically, we just confirmed the things already mentioned.

## Bright Future Ahead

If I were a Celtics' fan, I would be very happy with the situation of the team. Talented, young(er) coach who has a really beautiful offensive philosophy. Two very solid veteran players who can guide the team when needed. Great supporting cast which fits really well in today's basketball; Smart is an amazing defender and started to shoot the ball well. A smart center in Theis who is doing a lot of statistically unseen things in the offense, while being a solid defender. Also, his shot is steadily improving.

And then the youth core of the Celtics, Tatum, and Brown. The team will stay the same for 2 more seasons, after which Hayward becomes FA. However, with Brown already committed to long term contract, and Tatum without a doubt being maxed, Celtics probably won't have a problem creating a team around the two of them.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,84548,public,self,Celtics Have Found Their Duo of the Future,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/gdaitz/celtics_have_found_their_duo_of_the_future/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,

I don't think I've heard anyone bring up a pickup-esque King of the Court tournament as a new addition to All-Star weekend even though I think both players and fans would love it. Get a group of like 8 or so guys from the All-Star rosters who want to participate and just play standard King of the Court (no offensive rebounds, a dribble restriction) until someone has around 8 or however many points. The dribble restriction and lack of offensive rebounds could keep the event moving at a quick pace and not feel boring and slow like the 2k tournament was a couple weeks ago. It would give players an opportunity to try-out some moves that they don't normally, and if the NBA wants to loosen-up on trash talk for this, it could turn-out to be semi-competitive too with some friendly banter between players. I think that it could take the place of something like the dunk contest or skills competition, as the skills competition is never super exciting to me and is the same thing every year, and unless some crazy brilliant change is made to the dunk contest, I think that it has reached its peak with the Lavine-Gordon contest, even though this year's contest was better because we were able to see guys like Aaron Gordon that fans know versus Glenn Robinson III winning the competition. I love the dunk contest, but unless the NBA is able to consistently able to convince star or like able players to do the contest that are talented, I don't think fans are gonna get super pumped about watching Hamidou Diallo beat-out Dennis Smith Jr., who in theory should be a great dunk contest participant, but he was just never that good. Anyways, though I've strayed from my original argument of adding King of the Court and gone into why the dunk contest is getting old and would've been dead by now if not for that infamous Lavine-Gordon competition in my opinion, I still think that King of the Court would be a win-win for the fans having something new and fun to watch and the players getting an event to hopefully try-out some street moves or something that they can't in games (like the All-Star game, but with more consistent defense and it doesn't take three hours).",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,84473,public,self,Should the NBA add a King of the Court tournament to All-Star weekend?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/gcwvlz/should_the_nba_add_a_king_of_the_court_tournament/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,

Raja Bell also came into the NBA undrafted that year and European legend Theodoros Papaloukas was in the class, though he never played in the NBA.

There's not a lot of super superstar players in this draft, just a remarkable amount of very strong-solid players who were important contributers on championship winning teams (Ginobli, Hamilton, Marion, the Jet, Artest).  Baron Davis was also a baller on the we believe warriors and AK47 was ahead of his time being such a versatile defender and offensive threat and debatably a top 10 player in the 2003/4 season.

The following trade ideas are in the event that Minnesota has a top 3 selection and wants to win now. 

1) Trade with Cleveland to get Love , Nance , Kevin Porter Jr. For Evan Turner, James Johnson, Jake Layman, Juan Hernangomez and + 1st round pick

2) Incase that trade is too rich for Cleveland - Love +KPJ for 1st Evan Turner and James Johnson

Why does Cleveland do this? Simple, they are getting the opportunity to get a top three pick from the Wolves and they keep their current top selection, ostensibly giving them two of the top three picks in the draft. They get off of Loves contract but pay the price of burgeoning KPJ in order to move Love. 

Why does Minnesota do it? They bring back a familiar star, with loads of playoff experience, he fits quite nicely with Kat and DLo. By having KAT and DLo Minnesota more or less concedes that their defense will be shit. In this trade they load up on offense as K Love is a third option but is utilized in a much better way that when he played with lebron. Also Minnesota is dumb enough to do it.

3) Pheonix  gives Booker and Jalen Lecque, Minnesota gives Evan Turner, Jarrett Culver, Josh Okogie, 1st round (top3) 2020, 1st rounder 2024, and 1st rounder 2026.

Okay this is a rediculous one I acknowledge that but humor me. Let's say Booker is so pissed about how his time has gone in PHX that he quietly tells mgmt that he wants out and wants to be with KAT and DLo ( low-key probable btw). 

Why does PHX do this aside from the fact that Booker is forcing it. Two top ten picks, this could be any combination to build around Ayton and oubre ( So Lamelo , Cole Anthony, Anthony Edwards, okongwu, Toppin, Deni) and you pair either of those two with Ayton + Oubre+ Culver. That's actually not a bad team. They are then compensated with two other first rounders from Minnesota in the future.

4) This one is crazy - LAC gives Lou Williams+ Montrezl+ Shamet for James Johnson + Jaylen Nowell + 2020 Top 3

Why does LAC - They wouldn't, but if they DID, it's because they love either of (Wiseman, Ball, Edwards, Deni, Okongwu, or Toppin) and they believe that that guy would work well with Kawhi and PG. But they wouldn't do this deal. Scratch this one.

5) Sorry about the last one, let's get real here. NOLA Gives- Jrue + Meli+ Jahlil 'the bus driver' Okafor for Okogie+Evan Turner+ James Johnson+ 2020(top 3) , 1st rounder 2024 and 2026.

Why does NOLA do it? They go full on and build around Zion with another top three pick? Maybe this is Lamelo and he pairs up with his bro, maybe it's Edwards and you have two freak athletes with Lonzo, and BI. 

Why Minnesota, I mean with Meli you get some extra floor spacing, Jrue is a star and actually would play defense.  

6) Last one Philadelphia give Tobias Harris and their first rounder ( OKCs pick) for James Johnson and Evan Turner and the top 3 pick 2020.
 
Alright why does Philly do this ( this is just as rediculous as the LAC trade). Philly has a glut right now with big wings who all do relatively the same thing while not complementing the combination of Embiid or Simmons. Tobias is a bit above league average for three point shooting, his shooting doesn't really help space the floor. They get off his horrible contract, they get the choice between Lamelo, Edwards, and Wiseman although they'd probably go Edwards. Or even trade this pick. They also get Turner who's 18 Mill expires in one year while Johnson's 15 Mill is in two years.

I think the Nets are one of the most interesting teams in the league going forward.  One can argue KD is so talented and injured his non dominant leg that he will come back and be a top 5 player.   Kyrie despite injuries recently is still a top 15 talent.  A supporting cast led by Caris Levert and Spencer Dinwiddie is strong as two high teens low 20s scorers who are both long and athletic and should improve defensively in more complementary roles.  The center position is a bit of a question mark but Deandre Jordan is still fine, as most great teams do not rely on great center play in 2020.  Taurean Prince was awful this season but I think was asked to do far too much and should be better as a 5th starter/ bench guy.   The Nets lack lengthy defenders but I think this can be filled in the offseason and this year's rookie Nicolas Claxton I think has a lot of defensive potential; he reminds me of Chris Boucher on the Raptors.  I think one can argue the Nets have as good a shot to win the East over the next 3 years as anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

However I think the Nets have an incredibly low floor compared to other NBA title contenders.  Kyrie has more of a track record but his body could just fail him going forward like it did it a Brandon Roy.  It is also arguable that Kyrie has never had a huge impact on winning and just was talented alongside Lebron.  KD could look terrible next year relatively and be an unathletic 20 PPG scorer who is bad on defense.  Levert has also always been injury prone and struggled with efficiency at times.  The Nets will probably look to trade Jarrett Allen this offseason for help on the wings, but allowing Deandre Jordan to start into his mid 30s could be costly.

Nobody asked. Nobody even thought about this, and nobody is going to do anything differently now that Stephen A. has suggested this. 

I didn’t even have to watch the video to know:

- The Knicks don’t have enough talent to trade for CP3 without throwing in draft picks (which is pretty much the only thing OKC wants) or a couple of: RJ Barrett, Mitchell Robinson, or Julius Randle. OKC doesn’t need Randle when they have Gallo, especially with the amount of money Randle’s making. That means Robinson and RJ are gonna have to be traded, but both are on rookie deals, so it’s not gonna be enough to match CP3’s salary. They’re gonna have to give away their two young players and their future draft picks for a 34 year old CP3. For two years. 

- CP3 is on one of the worst contracts in the league, but he’s been good for OKC, who has a decent amount of cap space, so they’re not trying to give him up just to free up cap space. 

- What the fuck would CP3 do on the Knicks? He could barely make his Hornets team a middle of the pack team. He thrives with good scorers and a consistent offense - BG/DJ on the clippers, Rockets minus Harden (and even with Harden they were a #1 team), and Gallo/SGA on the Thunder. 

- Even with the Thunder having a much better surrounding cast around CP3 than the Knicks would, it’s not like they’re a GREAT team - they’re an above average team that just beat expectations for this year. They are by no means a title contender. 

Adding CP3 to the Knicks would AT BEST make them an 8th seed for the two remaining years on his contract. What next? You’re gonna resign 36 year old CP3? Would he even resign with the Knicks? What would this do beyond get the Knicks to the playoffs with no hope of advancing for like a year or two??

Hey everyone - I deconstructed MJ’s fadeaway jumper piece by piece - from setup, body feints and spins, to the jump, release, landing, and counters to explain what make it such a devastating &amp; unstoppable move, via the lens of biomechanics and sports science. Thanks to the mods for letting me post.

Here’s a table of contents, header (sub-headings):

\- 0:00 Intro

\- 0:55 Balance and stability (midline balance, base of support, sagittal - side - view)

\- 2:37 Rhythm &amp; coordination (rhythm &amp; flow, full body synchronization, copy and paste mechanics, rhythm eliminates distraction)

\- 4:02 Key mechanics (Biomechanics, loading/unloading, eccentric load &amp; recoil, fluid weight shifts, risky knee valgus?, the jump, the landing, high speed weight shifts)

\- 9:01 Counters &amp; deceptions (Always keep them guessing)

For those at work or the hard of hearing, I've transcribed subtitles on YouTube so sound isn't required.

Summary (will do my best without the visuals): MJ's fadeaway became one of his main staples over the final arch of his career and he shot it with relatively high efficiency, becoming one of the key drivers for the Bulls second three-peat run. The first thing that sticks out about MJ's fadeaway is how he always maintained balance and stability throughout the movement, from the setup to the gather to the jump and release. One technique he used for this was keeping a wide base of support during his movements. Secondly, he used a rhythmic routine that optimized his coordination (aka neuromuscular priming) to the point that many of his jumpers looked nearly identical. He mastered the degrees of freedom on the specific movement. In addition, the routine - like a free throw routine - helps eliminate any internal or external distractions. Thirdly, the fadeaway involved numerous key techniques where he utilized principles such as elastic recoil and playing up on his forefoot to facilitate efficient, fluid weight shifts and generate quick burst movements, especially on his spins into the fadeaway. On certain parts of the shot, it looked like his knees might be in a high risk position but he had elite neuromuscular control and used open chain principles (a comparison in the video is Lionel Messi on free kicks who it looks like is ""spraining"" his ankle when he rolls over onto his plant foot). Further, MJ's jump power was critical on the shot because it gave more margin for error with  a higher release and it also allowed him to get clearer vision on the rim (again in the video, I note how he begins his release point once his sightline clears the defenders' outstretched arm). MJ's landing mechanics were also superb, coming down on his forefoot and sitting back into his posterior chain (hips, hamstrings) to attenuate force. Lastly for mechanics, on high speed spin feints, MJ would internally rotate his pivot leg with only the medial (inner) part of his foot touching the ground which allowed him to weight shift fluidly and not worry about being in a high risk position. A player who currently does that is Kyrie whom I made a video on a couple weeks ago. The final piece of MJ's fadeaway and what truly made it nearly unstoppable were his numerous counters and ability to deceive the defender. He could shoot it off either shoulder, reverse spin, pump-fake, into the lane, quick spin without any feint, string multiple moves into a one footed quick jump (example I used on this was vs KG, incredible move). Did my best to summarize that as best as possible without any visual aids.

The guy got thrashed against elite bigs.  Allow me to explain...

Michael Jordans Bulls were 3-9 against the Utah Jazz from the 1984/85 season to the 1989/90 season.  Why?  Because they had Mark Eaton, Thurl Bailey, and Karl Malone to dominate the front court.  

The Magic beat the Bulls in six in 1995.  Why?  Because Shaq and Horrace Grant dominated the front court.  

Afterwards, Jordan even said ""We're a Horace Grant away..."" at then end of that series.  The Rockets swept that Magic team in the Finals in 1995.

Then you have the Rockets, who were 7-3 against the Bulls from 1990-1995.  Why?  Hakeem Olajuwon.

Jordan even said they didn't have an answer for ""...the big African"".

The San Antonio Spurs were 7-3 against the Chicago Bulls from 1990 - 1995.  Why?  David Robinson.

Now there's two more interesting points to bring up.  The New York Knicks had a freakishly dominant front court during Jordans reign but those Knicks teams always had a below average offenses.  Those Jazz, Magic, Rockets, and Spurs teams always had solid offensive output.

Secondly, the Portland Trailblazers who were always a step away from the Bulls in the 90s missed out on Arvydas Sabonis because Russia wouldn't let him come to the USA.  If you're not familiar with Arvydas Sabonis, please look into him.  7'3"" 290 lb monster who could do everything at a crazy level.

On one hand, I’m inclined to say he’d obviously thrive in today’s spread, early offense pick and roll systems. That was his specialty after all. On the other hand, I think defenses have expanded their pick and roll coverages compared to the 2000’s, especially now with most 4’s (and some 5’s) being able to get out on the perimeter. His athleticism could hurt in this regard as well as I’m sure he could blow by 5’s if switched on to him, but I think some 4’s would give him trouble. And this is before we get to him most likely getting exposed on pick and roll’s non-stop on the defensive end.

I know the game has changed a lot over the periods I'm going to discuss and these questions might trigger some, but I am genuinely looking for answers from more knowledgeable fans and happy to accept if I'm wrong.

The questions largely relate to super-teams and how the best players on those teams are viewed and  ranked all time. All time lists are made all the time on reddit and often feature Magic, Kareem and Larry Bird - all of whom played on ridiculous super teams in an era were there was generally less talent in the league. 

Why is this never brought up as a reason to discredit some of their accomplishments as it is with today's superstars?

This post about KD is full of responses about him joining a super team, but that super team still had to go through  AD, Harden/CP3 and Lebron/Kyrie/Kevin Love. The warriors are arguably no more stacked than the 80s Lakers and Celtics and faced much more competition. Why is KD discredited so heavily for joining this team? I can understand arguments for Bird being higher ranked but if the only knock on KD is the super-team thing is it not overblown?

Even compared to MJ, I saw a graphic recently that unfortunately I cant find again that showed the number of All-NBA and All-Defence selections for Lebron and MJ teammates (while they were teammates) and MJ was most definitely on an all time great team (Greatest rebound ever in Rodman, arguably greatest perimiter defender ever, and original point forward in Scottie Pippen, All time great coach, and great role players who went on to be pivotal in title wins for other organisations.) Almost everyone around MJ has gone on to/had previously shown to be able to play important roles/make big shots in the finals and win chips. 

Why is MJ talked about like a god who won it all alone, whilst Lebron and KD are talked down for seeking help?

Before getting help MJ was getting losing records/bounced in the first round - while Lebron took a terrible team to the finals. Why is 6-0 in the finals all that matters, but today's superstars (Westbrook for example) are killed for not making it out of the first round multiple times?

Giannis has struggled with his ability to move side-to-side, cut and switch directions, and his overall fluidity in this aspect for quite some time. It hinders his ability to guard players on the perimeter, as well as impeding on his progress as a perimeter scorer. Due to his average lateral quickness, he can't get past defenders using skill and finesse, but rather brute strength and speed. 

And in the playoffs, where teams are playing a physical zone, sometimes pure athleticism won't guarantee you a field goal. But if he were able to move fluidly, and quickly, side-to-side then it would keep the defense active and guessing. Of course, pairing a consistent shot with this would make him virtually unguardable, as he could easily beat his defender off the dribble with his lateral movement, square up, and shoot the shot.

Defensively, it would also unlock a new dimension to his game. Admittedly, he has already noticeably improved in this aspect. But if he had good defensive lateral quickness and not just above average, it would make him arguably the most versatile defender in the league. He's not suitable to guard shiftier players because they're always active and always moving in different directions, and due to his merely above average lateral quickness, he's prone to getting beat off the dribble and just being one step behind. It also prohibits him from guarding the opposing team's best player. 

So, in short, his average lateral movement, quickness, and his overall fluidity in his ability to move side-to-side really impedes on his on-ball and perimeter defense as well as stunting his offensive growth as he trends towards the perimeter. It also hinders his ability to break down a defense using his handle and shiftiness as opposed to raw physicality. 

He could improve this weakness defensively by trusting his length and being more alert and attentive when guarding on the ball, but especially on the perimeter. His screen navigation was also poor but he started to move under the screen and trust his length and straight-line speed to get a good contest and not be screened off. His long strides, defensively, could work to his benefit, as he could beat opponent's to their zone and effectively end the play.

Will he ever be a league-best perimeter and on-ball defender? Of course not. But can he improve, trust his physical tools, and be much more alert and attentive? Absolutely. And obviously long strides aren't great for a perimeter defender, but as I stated in the paragraph above, he can use them to his benefit by beating his assignment to their zone. 

Offensively, I'm a bit confused, as his lateral movement on that end would need to be paired with a shot otherwise he'd simply be beating his man off the dribble and getting an easy dunk at the rim. But as many have stated, this won't work in the playoffs. So this will be virtually exclusive with getting a consistent shot. But who's to say he can't develop both at the same time? As he experiments with different shots, he could work on defenders in isolation situations by using his handle, pulling his dribble back, and shooting the shot. It's hard to truly convey into words, but look at other players his size such as Anthony Davis or Kevin Durant and watch their games on film, then compare their film to Giannis’, you'll notice they can size up a defense, take opponents off the dribble and knock down a shot, they can cross opponents up, and overall can just play at different paces and get shifty for lack of a better term. Like I stated before, his lateral movement offensively is mutually exclusive with getting a consistent shot. If he, and we all know he does, wants to be a dynamic shot maker, he'll need to improve his ability to take a defense off the dribble, knock down tough shots with consistency, and use his handle to get to his comfortable non-paint zones.

Defensively, it's also about his fundamentals and attention to detail as well playing defense on his toes as opposed to playing flat on his feet or on his heels. Have constantly moving feet, using his long strides to his benefit, and just being more patient. To summarize this to the best of my ability, improving his lateral quickness and movement offensively should be paired with his jump shot development. Defensively, it's much more mental and attention related than it is physically. 

**TL;DR: His ability to move side-to-side quickly, cut and switch directions fluidly, and his overall IQ and attention to detail all impede on his offensive and defensive potential.**",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,84022,public,self,Things Giannis can still improve,0,[],0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/gaq9pw/things_giannis_can_still_improve/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,

Well, there are some days I feel like he definitely is, and then other days I take a step back and ask myself:

""Is James Harden really a top 10 player in the NBA?""

I know how ridiculous it sounds because it's no secret that media has raved about how amazing of a generational scoring talent Harden is. Make no mistake, he is absolutely a bonafide and unstoppable scorer, and probably one of the best 1-on-1 players to ever play the game.

What makes this question appear even sillier is that Harden has finished in the top two in MVP voting the last three years and was likely on his way to another top-five finish this year. LeBron and Giannis were the only players guaranteed ahead of him.

One of the main topics to address here is defense, of course. We don't seem to hear about Harden's defensive downfalls quite as much anymore. Part of that is because he makes up for it offensively and another big reason is that he defends bigger guys somewhat well at times. All in all though, Harden is a minus on the defensive end (although stats might not always indicate that).

Another concern to address here: Harden's utterly different playing style. Harden dominates the ball more than any other player in the league, and by a pretty sizable margin too. Giannis actually has a higher usage rate and Luka Doncic matches Harden's usage rate. However, Harden averages 5.87 dribbles per touch. Only Trae Young beats him in that department.

I know that in four of the last five years we have seen the Rockets make two conference finals appearances and two conference semifinals appearances, and who know what would have happened had Chris Paul not gotten hurt in the 2018 conference finals? But that also brings me to another question: are we giving Harden's current teammates (P.J. Tucker and Eric Gordon) and former teammates (Trevor Ariza and Clint Capela) enough credit?

That brings me to my last point and that is a whole list of players one might prefer over Harden, even if stats might not support it.

Tier 1: LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis

Tier 2: Joel Embiid, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Pascal Siakam, Bradley Beal, Klay Thompson, Nikola Jokic, Karl-Anthony Towns, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler

Some of them doesn't want to be included,  some others are not for unknown reasons.  
Trying to predict their overalls would be fun too.

I'll make the start with the most popular ones:

1)Charles Barkley

Sir Charles should be the most anticipated missing legend. 
Playing in the PF , although he was at best 6'6"".
He averaged 22.7 ppg, 11.7 rpg, 3.9 apg for his career. 
Former MVP, 11x All Star, ex Dream Team member and at least top-5 PF of all time etc. 
His best years of his career were with the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns. With his last years being with the Houston Rockets. 

All-Time Philadelphia 76ers OVR: 97-98 range

All-Time Phoenix Suns  OVR: 95-96 range

I think his best years individually were in the 80's. 
I guess he could be included in the All-Time Houston Rockets team by some but I won't include him. 


2)Reggie Miller

6'7"" SG.
One of the best shooters of all time, 2nd most 3PM in the NBA history. 
18.2 ppg during his career with over 25.000 points
5x All Star, 50-40-90 club.
Played for the Indiana Pacers for his whole 18year-career. 

All-Time Indiana Pacers OVR: 94-95 range


3)Manu Ginobili 

Standing at 6'6"" he played as a Shooting guard. 
One of the best international players the NBA has seen.
Played all of his 16 years in the league with the San Antonio Spurs creating a legendary trio along Tim Duncan and Tony Parker. 
13ppg, 4apg during his career.
4x Champion, 2x All Star , best 6th man some of his many accolades.

All-Time San Antonio Spurs OVR: 93-94


4)Rasheed Wallace

As a 6'11"" forward, 'Sheed played for many teams during his 16-year career in the NBA. 
You either loved him or hated him. 
His greatest achievement was of course the championship with the Pistons in '04 playing a major role. 
Along with this title some other accomplishments were 4x All star appearances.
14.4 ppg, 6.7 rpg during his career. (Could have included the techs)

All-Time Detroit Pistons OVR: 88-89

All-Time Portland Trail-Blazers OVR: 89-90

Similar to Barkley , his best individual years didn't came from his championship winning team. So I thought his Jail Blazers overall should be a bit higher. 


5)Tayshaun Prince

A 6'9"" Small Forward with a long wingspan. 
14 years in the league.
Another Pistons' champ.
Great defender with some All Defensive teams. 
11ppg for his career. 

All-Time Detroit Pistons OVR: 87-88

2003-04 Pistons are not the same without Prince and Wallace. 


6)Ron Artest aka Metta World Peace

The 6'7"" Small Forward played averaged 13.2ppg while playing for 6 different teams.
A great defender and a one time champ with the Lakers in 2010.

All-Time Indiana Pacers OVR: 87-88 


I also wanted to add two legends of the 60's. 
Many legends are excluded from the game, but let's face it...We could always keep finding players arguably deserving it more than others. 



7)Walt Bellamy
First is the 6'11"" center. One of the best players of the '60's. With his greatest seasons playing for the Washington Wizards(Baltimore Bullets). 
With 20.1ppg and 13.7rpg for his career

All-Time Washington Wizards OVR: 93-94
All-Time New York Knicks OVR: 89-90
All-Time Atlanta Hawks OVR: 87-88


8)Hal Greer

Another all time great. A Hall of Famer.
Standing at 6'2"" played at the guard positions. 
His only NBA team was the Philadelphia 76ers,  winning a championship along Wilt Chamberlain in 1967. 
Averaged 19.2ppg,5rpg and 4apg for his career.  Adding 10x all star appearances to his accolades. 

All-Time Philadelphia 76ers OVR: 93-94


That was my short list of some legends who are excluded from the game.

It is very clear that the three point shot has become a crucial part of basketball today. In the past, the NBA has changed its rules to try to diversify different play styles so no one style is too dominant, such as widening the lane for Mikan and then again for Wilt. The three point line was added to give the smaller players more of an advantage so the game was less dominated by big men. Now, its is difficult for the traditional big man to even find a spot in the league. Lots of guys who were very impactful in the paint or posting up, such as Al Jefferson or Roy Hibbert, fell out of the league just as fast as the three point shot started to dominate the league. There are exceptions, such as Rudy Gobert, but it is definitely much harder to find a traditional big in todays NBA and they are much less impactful. Now it is important for the NBA to evolve and it isnt good to have play styles not change at all, but the nba has almost gotten to the point where if you cant shoot you cant be in the league. Why should super athletic freaks of nature like Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid be forced to stand at the three point line. Goldsberry looks at the points per posession stats and points out that Anthony Davis gets more points per posession of his three point shot than his post up. So clearly it is smart for him to spend more time at the three point line. This has caused the game to become more one dimensional to where every team will just spread the floor and run iso plays. I dont want to go to an NBA game and watch Davis and Embiid, these massive and athletic freaks of nature who can achieve things that seem humanly impossible, just stand around and shoot threes. For a solution Goldsberry really crunched the numbers, im not going to go in depth into those here, and basically found a three point line distance that i think was about 2 inches back but dont quote me on that. Basically it moved the line back to where the NBA average points per posession from that distance would equal its average ppp in post up situations, effectively bringing back the mid-range and post games. Three point specialists like Curry would still be dominant but other players who could be more dominant in other areas can show their dominance in those areas. Obviously the corner three would have to be dealt with in some way but i wont get into that now and Goldsberry does address that. What do you guys think about this? I know people have talked about a 4 point line which i personally do not like because i feel that would just encourage shooting from deep even more and go even farther away from the other aspects of basketball but what are some thoughts on moving the three point line back?

TLDR: the NBA is too reliant on three pointers and should move the line back to revive dead aspects such as the mid range and post up game.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,83934,public,self,Moving back the three point line,0,[],,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ga66yo/moving_back_the_three_point_line/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,

Free up defenses to play however they want without arbitrary restriction.

*But it's gonna be boring, they'll just camp a 7 footer in the paint!*

Really? In 2020, the era of versatility and switchability, you think that would be an effective strat?

If someone does that, the offense is just gonna shoot. Everyone can shoot now. If your offense can't counter such a simple trick, then your offense is *bad*, and shouldn't be bailed out.

A welcome consequence of this would be increased activity in the mid-range. If the defending center is camping out under the basket, a natural counter will be to pop the 10-15 footer (if not a 3). Voila, this will pull the center out from the paint, and if it doesn't, you keep getting free middies.

Important to note that most plays would remain untouched, because usually there's an offensive player within arms length anyway. I don't buy that this would just turn every game into a shootout, because it wouldn't be an appreciable difference in most instances.

*Defense needs a buff.* This isn't world-altering, but it's a start. Allow teams to play how they want, able to leverage whatever advantages they believe they have, and allow the free market of basketball ideas to dictate the outcome. 3 in the key is a vague rule that's inconsistently enforced, and isn't necessary in the modern game.

The end result would be:

* more severe punishment of bad offenses

* a buff for high IQ, mobile rim protectors (who wouldn't have to worry about some random 5 second long ""3 second"" clock)

I love you all! Here's a little blog post from a professional pure hooper.  Enjoy, Namaste!

From a caterpillar to a butterfly. A little caterpillar feels the growing pains of becoming a butterfly, because it’s going to go up, up, up and away! It is not “easy” to learn how to fly, but when you dig deep and find out that you could’ve been flying all the time, well, then, you never go back to the old!

We are all meant to ascend. Especially now, in this day of time! The practices, the ice baths, the yoga, the film study, all comes into one. I am! All comes back to the source of all things. That we buried that butterfly within. Power is within, my friend. 

Let me tell you a little story about how I found out that you can fly instead of being stuck on the ground. One spring, when my ascension began, I was working three times a day on my game, for 6 days a week. It was non stop. I was working on Elite Guard Training programs and the programs were great! 

I focused, locked in on what I wanted to become. True master of the game. But back then, I did not realize that I was doing it for the “goodies.” You know, the ego stuff. Score this much points, get that award etc. And so, I improved, A LOT. While improving, I wasn’t relaxing, I was doing too much and I was thinking too much about the “goodies”.

One of my friends that summer told me - “Fly like that while you play and there’s no limits for you.” I was inspired, but I did not understand that fully. Let me explain it this way, to fly, means to be light, like air. But, I was holding so much baggage that I could not fly like I wanted to, I would crash in buildings, I would fall down and hit my head. I was like a drunk bird.

Then, I invested in meditation. Where I found out my demons and started to relax. As, I started to do meditation which is not mystical it is just finding out what you buried and raising your energy frequency vibration so you can enter new and more beautiful realities. 

At, last I fully understood, why do I hoop. I hoop because I love to have the ball in my hands, I hoop because I love to the in and out hesi, between the legs cross. I hoop because I love it all net. I hoop because I look the dish it to ya’ so you can have some cookies. I hoop because I love the joy on the court and off of it. I hoop because I hoop. Dear basketball. I love you.

My time, now has come to mastery, I mastered the game.. Now, I move on to teaching to achieve mastery. My, game will be just for fun. I will still hoop for the joy of it, workout for the joy of the reverse layup and the euro scoops. I will still play on the courts and hit you with deep threes and nasty mid range J’s. I will fully dedicate myself to teaching players like you to achieve this mastery. This is my life calling right now. It is from a higher consciousness and I must do it, so we can all ascend. So you can find out, why you truly hoop and fly, just like a butterfly.

When you look at Lebron’s career so far points per game so far he averages 27 ppg compared to Kobe’s 25 ppg. I’ve always thought Kobe was the superior scorer so when I saw the actual stats I was surprised. Then I realized why Kobe’s points per game were so much lower was because he wasn’t starting in his first 2 years of his career. He wouldn’t average that many points because he didn’t play that many minutes. So when you look at the points per a full game played (48 minutes) the stats are:

Kobe- 33.2 points
Lebron- 33.85 points

So by the end of Lebron’s career they will probably be even closer in this stats. These stats show a much more accurate representation in their scoring abilities and account for games where they got injured early in the game, sat the 4th quarter because it was a blowout, and overtime games.

The same happened a few years later when Bill Simmons published his Book of Basketball, kept writing for Grantland, but ultimately stopped doing so in exchange for some podcast of what he called his BoB 2.0.

With this current scene in place we have taken on the task of writing some sort of independent ""recap"" book covering the last couple of decades of NBA basketball mixing a little bit of BoB (the main stories of the decade in some sort of comprehensive timeline that covers most of them in a linear way--obviously with jumps here and there and from interesting angles mostly unexplored, not just a Wiki copy-paste) and a little bit from the concepts explored on the books from FreeDarko that came out in the 00s (more explorative, personal, esoteric, and cultural/psychological approach to the game and it's characters, and not precisely your boring LeBrons and Steph's but rather guys like Matt Barnes, Boogie Cousins, et.).

All in all, we're aiming to write a good bunch of essays covering (mostly) the last decade linking it with the past of the game, some cultural/social topics that are related to the characters that are or were part of the league, throw in some [original art](https://www.reddit.com/r/heat/comments/g8zoah/oc_udonis_haslem_illustration/), some charts to explain some data in interesting ways, etc.

Before getting much deeper into it (there are around 4 or 5 essays completed already) we'd like to get some feedback of the potential people's interest in this sort of work, how you'd like it best to be presented, the type of content or storylines to appear in it, some under-the-radar or forgotten stories or players to write about, etc.

We're super excited with the project and if we can get this thread going and people show enough of an interest we might share one of the completed essays in PDF to let you see how we think the final could look.

I get it his numbers were never WOW like  but IT is so much more than those numbers, he was the heart and soul of them Pistons teams and beat 3 of the greatest players ever on great teams in series while they were in their prime.  And he gets no credit all time, no mention all time except as part of the bad boy pistons that MJ conquered. That's what he's relagated to. That and for MJ hating him so much he kept him off the dream team.  So if you get a chance go watch some IT, watch some of them bad boy piston games.

- Miami represented a clear peak in efficiency. His final two years in Miami, in particular, were masterclasses of uber-efficient volume scoring: 38 points/100 possessions on *+10.7% efficiency*, Curry-esque. His final 2 Cleveland years (during both stints) were relative high points, too, averaging around a +6.5 during those 4 seasons. 

- LA-bron has been a relative low-point in efficiency, as while LeBron's own raw efficiency has only dipped slightly from his Cleveland years (61-&gt;58), the rest of the league has caught up, with league average TS% rising from an average of 54.6 during Bron's 2nd Cavs stint to 56.2 during his LA tenure.

- LeBron's scoring rate has remained remarkably consistent, with only a slight decline since peaking in 2009.

- LeBron's playmaking, on the other hand, has seen a clear upward trend throughout his career, with a clear spike in this past season with the addition of all-time-level rim target AD to the Lakers

How about the playoffs, then?

[[**GRAPH**]](https://i.imgur.com/25jhEQD.png)

(Bonus: [advanced numbers](https://i.imgur.com/RIQD2e1.png))

- LeBron's 14-game long 2009 postseason run was a statistical masterpiece on all fronts, something of an outlier even for LeBron: all-time-great scoring rate (47.5 pts/100), elite efficiency (+7.4 rTS%), very good assist rate (39.5%), and, not indicated in the graph, career low turnovers (2.7). These factors all contributed to some stupidly dominant advanced numbers - 0.399 WS/48 (career playoff avg 0.244), 37.4 PER (career playoff avg 28.3), and, perhaps most incredibly, a 17.5 BPM (career playoff average 10.2). 

- 2014 once again featured some insanely efficient scoring from LeBron, this time in the postseason: 40 pts/100 on +12 rTS%. (This, following a regular season with a fantastic 38 pts/75, +10.8 rTS%.)

- Like in the regular season, LeBron's playoff scoring and assist rate took somewhat of a nosedive in Miami with his reduced load, but his advanced numbers were as strong as ever with the help of improved efficiency and team results (in terms of 3 year peaks, it's right up there with his two Cleveland stints, if not slightly higher due to his all-world defense in Miami)


- His final Cleveland stint (esp taking his final 3 years) has been very strong as well, putting up advanced metrics - WS/48 ~0.270, BPM ~11 - that only really Jordan and Kawhi have ever matched in the modern era (young Duncan and 3-peat Shaq and Finals MVP Kobe and GS-KD have had excellent showings, but their advanced numbers are slightly below those guys).

We've done 2 more drafts since then, this time including the 2019-20 season, so that we could give accurate monetary values to players such as Luka, Middleton, Siakam and Tatum. The board as a whole didn't change a significant amount but many players have had their price go up or down a few, and the 2019-20 players being updated definitely give it a fresh twist. I thought it would be a good time to post this again now while many people have more free-time so we can get maximum engagement.

---

The rules for the draft board are as follows:

You get a **budget of $100.**

**The roster size is 10 players.** You can have as many $1 players as you would like if you want to abandon depth for starpower. Last time the rosters were only 8 players so this board will be slightly more difficult in that regard.

These drafts were single-season only, so **every player here is at their absolute peak form.** Longevity is not taken into account. If you want to further the validity of your team and take the extra effort, list the season of the player you would like to take as well.

Consider fit when making your roster.

Any player not listed is available for $1.

---

Keep in mind that these prices are not my opinion, but based on the average draft position over 8 all-time fantasy drafts that I hosted. The only decision that we made was where to set LeBron and Jordan (who went top 2 every single draft), and what the gap between them and O'Neal (who was 3rd in ADP yet has gone as low as 7) would be. We thought a $45 cap for the best players would be good because it takes up a large amount of your salary while still being able to have any duo you can possibly want.

The prices may look odd on the surface but everyone participating in the draft put a large emphasis on spacing and defensive ability and what makes you fit on a title team more so than just being the best player in a vacuum. It is also worth considering that wings were generally higher valued than guards or bigs due to the depth of their positions as a whole.

Let me know if you think this is too difficult or too easy and I can make an adjustment to the formula. I sorted the players by position for organizational purposes but some positions are obviously up for debate so it may not be 100% accurate.

Who had the most impactful career?
Who had the most successful career?

And let’s combine both together so you can’t just choose one or the other but overall of both categories.

If you had to choose, would it be...

The scoring champ? 13 second man? Mr 1:st round exit. 

Or 

Half man half amazing, dunk champion, worlds greatest dunk of all time and college matters. 

Just some random thoughts, I’m really having a hard one over who to choose. 

Like Vince took dunking to a whole nother level. He was iconic in beginning of his career and ebbed out towards the middle/end (Jersey years-ish) whereas T-Mac evolved more at his two stops and became Tracy Mccgrady the scoring champ in Orlando and evolved into T-Mac the scoring machine in Houston.

Fantastic on both ends, his only slight weakness was shooting and knowing his work ethic he would have added that to his arsenal by 2012-13. People who look back at his MVP season and compare PER and VORP and stats really didn't live that 2010-11 season and didn't watch those games. What he did can't be explained on a spreadsheet he elevated a team whose only other consistent offensive threat was Luol Deng into a 62 win powerhouse that really competed with the Heatles in the 2011 playoffs. Brought leadership, perseverance, and fantastic play to one of the great blue collar hustle teams ever. A shame he never went up against Curry in a playoff series, would have been a great yin/yang battle, two opposite play-style point guards. 

For me the most overrated is Brandon Roy...sorry Blazers fans. A super crafty, smooth player who could get to the rim, decent shooter, good FT shooter, high BBIQ, capable defender, good playmaker, but he wasn't really GREAT at anything. He was a guy who was just good at everything, but couldn't dominate with any of his skillsets. I remember back in 09 when he was at his best people considered him the fourth best SG in the league behind Kobe Wade and Iso Joe. I don't think he could ever be the 1st or even 2nd option on a championship team. I think his ceiling is a better version of Josh Howard.

Essentially, Cole Zwicker created this archetypes to classify the majority of NBA players. I found them extremely helpful in terms of contextualizing what roles players, particularly potential players, can actually fill. Unfortunately, Cole deleted his site, which was where these archetypes were documented. Through the Wayback Machine, I was able to find the archetypes, but not the detail for them. So I decided to try and flesh them out by memory.

For this post, I'll focus on part two of archetypes for Wings:

***

**Fours**
--

This category is composed of more traditional power forward types. As the game has changed, these players have become marginalized, but there are still these types lingering around. Though perhaps for not much longer. Archetypes are:

**Two-Way Playmakers:** These guys are capable of operating with the ball a lot and play large, effective roles on a team’s offense, creating for both themselves and others. Also, they are effective on defense. Fairly rare, but valuable archetype. 

*Examples:* Pascal Siakam is the best current example of this archetype. At his peak in Atlanta, Paul Millsap fit in as well. Might be a bit controversial, but before he lost any ability to score effectively, Draymond Green could fit in as well here. I'd throw Ben Simmons in as well if he wasn't so difficult to categorize.

**Offensive Playmakers:** Same as the above archetype, but not particularly effective on defense. Often, these players are very valuable on offense, but they’re lack of defense compounded with the way the game has moved away from traditional PFs makes their ability to scale on a high-level team questionable.

*Examples:* This past season, John Collins was perhaps the most notable iteration of this archetype. Blake Griffin has also been this type of guy throughout his career. Kevin Love as well.

**Two-Way Skilled/Stretch:** Players who can shoot the three-ball and sometimes bring additional talent -- be-it ball-handling, post-scoring, or passing -- but not at the level that they can function as genuine high volume guys on offense. Also, they are effective on defense. These guys are often quite effective role players.

*Examples:* He fell of a bit this past year, but Thaddeus Young is the kind of guy I have mind for this archetype. Nikola Mirotic, Ersan Ilyasova, Maxi Kleber, and Markieff Morris are other guys who slide in here. If his three pointer continues to be legit, Larry Nance Jr. as well. Trey Lyles is a guy who you can see belonging here, even if he has yet to be particularly effective. Depending on how you feel about his defense, Juancho Hernangomez and Nemanja Bjelica. 

**One-Way Skilled-Stretch:** Same as the above category, but not particularly effective on defense. Far less playable than the above category, as, considering the way the game has evolved, these types often get played off the floor on defense.

*Examples:* Davis Bertans and Mike Scott are two of the more prominent current players in this archetype. I can see a case for Dario Saric, though maybe he belongs in the above category. Depending on how you feel about their defense, Jauncho Hernangomez and Nemanja Bjelica. Ryan Anderson, Matt Bonner, and Steven Novak are former examples.

**Face-Up Handlers with Low Feel/Defense:** One-way offensive players who are talented on the ball, but lack feel. Some value as bench guys, but don’t seem to be the kind of players who you want on the floor at the end of a tight game. 

*Examples:* Julius Randle and Bobby Portis are two of the more prominent names. Some other random guys, present and past: Derrick Williams, Michael Beasley, Carl Landry.

**Energy + Motor:** Essentially, these are guys who have the skills of a Five, but not the size to play there. Frankly, not very common anymore. More and more of these guys actually can play the Five now, and those who can’t have been phased out of the league. 

*Examples:* Dwight Powell is an example of this archetype who has actually been quite good, though maybe that's due to playing next to a stretch 5 (he could also maybe play the 5 nowadays). Kenneth Faried used to be a prominent example of this archetype.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,83630,public,self,NBA Player Archetypes: Fours,0,[],,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/g8mhfm/nba_player_archetypes_fours/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,

How did they pan out for the teams that took them?

Instead of a binary designation of ""bust"" and ""not bust,"" I think it's worth dividing the positive category into ""impact"" and ""wash"" — did the player move the needle for their team or land in an All-NBA conversation, or did they contribute just enough to be serviceable for more than a couple years? 

I decided to start from 2015 because some prospects in the years since are either too early to warrant a true bust-judgment (Ayton) or a shade below being an impact player (Simmons, who I actually think will eventually make multiple All-NBA teams, but could also be traded by Philly before he gets there). 

Here we go. Let me know what you think. 

2015:: Karl-Anthony Towns: **impact** 
&gt; He hasn't had the material success of other impact players, but a 2018 All-NBA honor and helping a downtrodden franchise break its playoff drought with video game stats is enough for me.

*IMPACT 1, WASH 0, BUST 0*

2014:: Andrew Wiggins: **wash**
&gt; Made it nearly six full seasons (and to a lucrative second contract) with his team on averages of over 20 PPG in multiple seasons, but no all-star appearances during his time in Minny stops him just short of impact status.

*IMPACT 1, WASH 1, BUST 0*

2013:: Anthony Bennett: **bust**
&gt;[One of the reasons I made this post in the first place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lt3Xw_8oMI). The value of a first overall pick wouldn't be questioned if it weren't crash-and-burn stints like his 2013-14 campaign.

*IMPACT 1, WASH 1, BUST 1*

2012:: Anthony Davis: **impact**
&gt;His team's success in one of history's deepest Western Conferences obviously left a lot to be desired, but AD's stats and individual honors made him one of the best players in the league. Won't hold my breath on an eventual jersey retirement, though.

*IMPACT 2, WASH 1, BUST 1*

2011:: Kyrie Irving: **impact** 
&gt;Sure he was traded after just five full seasons with the Cavs, but no question Uncle Drew established himself as an offensive powerhouse, all-NBA talent and Cleveland sports icon.

*IMPACT 3, WASH 1, BUST 1*

2010:: John Wall: **impact**
&gt;Another guy whose team you wish accomplished more, but John Wall was a nightly force to be reckoned with at his peak and a surefire all-star out east.

*IMPACT 4, WASH 1, BUST 1*

2009:: Blake Griffin: **impact**
&gt; Aside from being the most exciting NBA rookie (one year delayed) in league history, he racked up honors, served as the Amar'e of a perennial playoff threat and earned MVP buzz in 2013-14. Hope his jersey makes it up to the rafters at Staples some day. 

*IMPACT 5, WASH 1, BUST 1*

2008:: Derrick Rose: **impact**
&gt;This is tough; we all know how it ended. Yet, as it always will, Rose's 2010-11 MVP season means he *mattered* in a way other injury-prone stars do not. And tell me [this isn't the Bulls' best moment of the 2010s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucLTGP3Fgwg). 

*IMPACT 6, WASH 1, BUST 1*

2007:: Greg Oden: **bust**
&gt; :( 

*IMPACT 6, WASH 1, BUST 2*

2006:: Andrea Bargnani: **bust**
&gt;As someone who watched this era of NBA history, it was dark in the moment, but so much more worse looking back on it. [Pour one out for our guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9dX6IhU2tM).

*IMPACT 6, WASH 1, BUST 3*

2005:: Andrew Bogut: **wash**
&gt;Struggled mightily with this one. Bogut landed an All-NBA bid in 2010 and recorded some very impressive numbers. He was a legitimate bona fide franchise player. But the Bucks went nowhere fast during his tenure in Milwaukee and topped 70 games only twice in six-and-a-half years. Sorry, man. 

*IMPACT 6, WASH 2, BUST 3*

2004:: Dwight Howard: **impact**
&gt; Cue the ""no post game!!"" haters, but anyone who watched prime Dwight [knew what he brought to the table](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g8jS90UwDI). One of the most athletic men to ever don an NBA jersey, and perhaps THE greatest NBA athlete at his size.

*IMPACT 7, WASH 2, BUST 3*

2003:: LeBron James: **impact**
&gt; This isn't Bleacher Report. No one's making me write something for all of these.

*IMPACT 8, WASH 2, BUST 3* 

2002:: Yao Ming: **impact**
&gt; Man couldn't stay healthy, but he was an icon and drew light MVP buzz across his prime years.

*IMPACT 9, WASH 2, BUST 3*

2001:: Kwame Brown: **bust**
&gt; :/ 

*IMPACT 9, WASH 2, BUST 4*

2000: Kenyon Martin: **wash**
&gt; It's surprising to remember K-Mart lasted just four full seasons in New Jersey, considering he was a significant part of two Finals runs. He put up some monster numbers in the '04 playoffs too. But again, four seasons is too few, and Martin was an Eastern Conference all-star just once as a Net. 

*IMPACT 9, WASH 3, BUST 4*

1999:: Elton Brand: **impact**
&gt; This is weird. Brand was a Bull for just two seasons. But let's face it, that had nothing to do with him — fresh from Duke, Brand had 20/10 numbers in his first two years and shared Rookie of the Year honors. 

&gt; But Jerry Krause, a guy we've been talking about a lot lately, was convinced he had a higher-ceiling rebuild up his sleeve; he tossed Brand to the Clippers for Tyson Chandler and doubled down on Eddy fucking Curry. While that project crashed and burned, Brand continued his rise in LA and received MVP hype in 2006, enough to edge into the impact category. That his best years weren't for the team that drafted him was no fault of Elton's.

*IMPACT 10, WASH 3, BUST 4*

1998:: Michael Olowokandi: **bust** 
&gt; ya, no.

*IMPACT 10, WASH 3, BUST 5*

1997:: Tim Duncan: **impact**
&gt; yeup

*IMPACT 11, WASH 3, BUST 5*

1996:: Allen Iverson: **impact***
&gt; You know what's the best way to spend quarantine? Watching prime AI highlights. Source: me.

*IMPACT 12, WASH 3, BUST 5*

1995:: Joe Smith: **wash**
&gt; Sure he [helped set back the city of Minnesota for a half-decade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Smith_(basketball)#Timberwolves_salary_cap_scandal), but sticking around for 16 seasons with decent numbers is no small feat. Pretty much the definition of a wash at the first overall pick.

**FINAL tally after 20 years of drafts**

*IMPACT 12, WASH 4, BUST 5*

My conclusion: Go after the number-one overall pick.

Collins has one more season remaining on his rookie contract before becoming a restricted free agent. Atlanta will have close to $75M in cap space in 2021, assuming that cap doesn’t move as a result of the COVID-19 situation. I believe Collins is eligible for up to a 4 year/~120M deal (25% max contract). 

Collins has been good, like really good, since Trae got to ATL. Basically 20/10 in the last two seasons on very good efficiency. His true shooting was 66% this season, and he even hit over 40% (!) of his 3s on nearly 4 attempts per game. Very impressive offensively, and seems like a great fit with Trae Young as a P&amp;R partner. 

On the other end, it’s another story. Collins hasn’t been able to be a center on defense without it being a complete disaster. He’s a bit small, and isn’t an elite rim protector. I don’t think anyone in Atlanta is comfortable with him as the five long term, especially when considering their recent acquisition of Capella and Dedmon. 

Those moves would make it seem like the Hawks plan on having Collins play the four. On the surface, that would seem to reduce his effectiveness greatly. Collins’ best abilities are his roll ability and finishing, and he’s able to build his three point shooting pick and pop game off of that. It would seem that Collins would be a lot more effective offensively without Capella and with more space. On defense, it might help Collins to have Capella behind him, but I’d think that bump wouldn’t make up for the offensive drop from the lack of spacing with Collins at the 4.

Numbers back this up. Per Cleaning the Glass, Collins and the Hawks had a offensive rating of 112 when he played at center, close to tops in the league. When he plays the four, that drops to 103. The defense does get better when playing next to a center, allowing a 116 defensive rating with Collins at center and only 111.5 with him at the four. 

So the defense gets 4.5 points better with him at the four, but the offense gets 9 points worse. A net effect of -4.5 pts/100 possessions with Collins playing the four instead of the five. 

So with that in mind, what do the Hawks do next summer? Do they match any offer because they’ve got more cap space than they know what to do with? Does Collins get a max, or anywhere close?

We all know that Jordan Kobe and Wade are in a league of their own and The Logo is right behind but also tier 1. After that there is a lot of talent but not a definitive pecking order. I want opinions as to who you think is deserving. I believe Harden is next up but his woeful defense and flopping has made him less attractive to the eye. McGrady is one who in his prime deserves to be tier 1 but it didn't last long and he didn't win. He may be more of a small forward as well but that really doesn't matter.  I like Ray Allen next and i hope people can remember how athletic he was early in his career.  I truly believe Klay Thompson deserves to be higher than people think because he is so good on both sides but he has always been overshadowed so time will tell. Do people like Mitch Richmond? An absolute tank and a soft touch who os absolutely deserving.  Lastly, what are others thoughts on Ginobli. Is he a superstar who always put the team first which restricted his numbers?

He has a great turn-around shot and a reliable hook shot as well utilizing the post more. He even has a few counters to throw off the defense. 

He's a better post passer, he'll attempts shots the defense gives him, and has much more patience when he's doubled. So the things said that proceed these 2 paragraphs don't change the fact that he's improved his game from the previous season. 


Now all of that said, outside of those little improvements to his game, he hasn't really changed as a scorer all that much. He has no sort of scoring game off the dribble, he can't hit shots at tough angles, his mid-range shooting is below 40% despite usually being left uncontested, he can't consistently make contested jumpshots, etc. 

A lot of his flaws as a player come from his lack of a good perimeter scoring game. People will look at his 3PT% and the rise in his attempts and think he has improve tremendously as a shooter when in reality his improvements have been marginal and it has barely changed the way defenses play him. One thing I noticed is that defenders won't sag *all* the way off of him, they'll at least give a weak contest whenever one of his shots go up. 

Anyways, his lateral quickness coupled with his inability to get shifty on the dribble also allows defenders to cut off his drive and force him to retreat out to the perimeter and run a new play. His handle is decent but it's not good enough to keep defenders at their best. 

I'm not questioning his ability to improve, everybody knows he has the drive. But I just think his physical qualities and his shooting mechanics could possibly stop him from maximizing his full potential. I'm hoping for the best but I won't be surprised if Giannis peaks at this current level.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,83388,public,self,Will Giannis ever improve tremendously as a perimeter threat?,0,[],,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/g6yg25/will_giannis_ever_improve_tremendously_as_a/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,

I created 8 teams from 8 great drafts. Then I made a bracket and simulated the results to determine a champion.

I used WhatIfSports.com to simulate a best of 7 for each matchup. They generate a full box score and play-by-play based on real stats (per 100, to accommodate for pace differences)

The accolades listed for each player are their accolades for their selected season. There are a few instances where I selected a season of a player where they didn’t have their best real-life accolades, but had superior stats. For instance, I went with Barkley’s 87-88 season over his MVP year because he was better on paper. The bench will be presented by position, not MPG. MPG in brackets.

**84**

Starters:
94-95 John Stockton (All-NBA 1st team, All-Star, All-def 2nd team, assists leader) [36]
87-88 Michael Jordan (MVP, DPOY, All-NBA 1st team, All-def 1st team, scoring leader, steals leader, PER leader) [40]
87-88 Jerome Kersey (none) [28]
87-88 Charles Barkley (All-NBA 1st team, eFG% leader, offensive reb leader) [38]
93-94 Hakeem Olajuwon (MVP, DPOY, All-NBA 1st team, All-def 1st team)[38]

Bench:
89-90 Vern Fleming (none) [6]
90-91 Jay Humphries (none) [6] 
85-86 Danny Young (none) [0]
85-86 Alvin Robertson (DPOY, MIP, All-def 2nd team, All-NBA 2nd team, All-Star, Steals leader) [28] 
91-92 Otis Thorpe (All-Star) [6]
88-89 Sam Perkins (none) [4]
91-92 Kevin Willis (All-Star, All-NBA 3rd team) [10]

Evaluation: 4 amazing starters HOF starters. Weakness would be SF, weak backup PG, &amp; almost no 3pt shooting. The favorites to win the tournament...but I’m not sure that they’re unbeatable. Kersey is probably one of the worst starters in this exercise, and the bench is only okay (compared to the other teams)

**85**

Starters:
90-91 Terry Porter (All-Star) [33]
91-92 Chris Mullin (All-NBA 1st team, All-Star) [38]
94-95 Detlef Schrempf (All-Star, All-NBA 3rd team) [34]
96-97 Karl Malone (MVP, All-NBA 1st team, All-Star, Defensive Reb leader, PER leader) [37]
89-90 Patrick Ewing (All-NBA 1st team, All-Star, Defensive Reb leader) [38]

Bench:
91-92 Spud Webb (none) [15]
92-93 Joe Dumars (All-def 1st team, All-NBA 2nd team, All-Star) [24]
96-97 Mario Elie (none) [0]
93-94 Charles Oakley (All-def 1st team, All-Star) [11]
89-90 Hot Rod Williams (none) [0]
89-90 A.C. Green (All-Star) [0]
95-96 Arvydas Sabonis (none) [10]

Karl &amp; Ewing can actually hang with 84, but Porter and Mullin don’t hold a candle to MJ and Stockton...can a better bench plus a better SF plus more 3pt shooting offset that? Probably not. But in the words of KG, “ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE!”

**87**

Starters:
88-89 Kevin Johnson (All-NBA 2nd team) [38]
89-90 Reggie Miller (All-Star) [36]

91-92 Armen Gilliam (none) [12]
92-93 Brad Lohaus (none) [0]
95-96 Olden Polynice (none) [10]

They may not have the star power of the other teams, but the starting 5 has beautiful chemistry and strong frontcourt defense.

**96**

Starters:
05-06 Steve Nash (MVP, All-NBA 1st team, All-Star, Assists leader, TS% leader) [34]
07-08 Kobe Bryant (MVP, All-NBA 1st team, All-def 1st team, All-Star) [38]
03-04 Peja Stojakovic (All-NBA 2nd team, All-Star, 3pt leader, FT% leader) [32]
06-07 Marcus Camby (DPOY, All-def 1st team, blocks leader) [32]
01-02 Ben Wallace (DPOY, All-def 1st team, All-NBA 3rd team, blocks leader, rebounds leader) [32]

Bench: 
00-01 Allen Iverson (MVP, All-NBA 1st team, All-Star, Scoring leader, Steals leader) [22]
02-03 Stephon Marbury (All-NBA 3rd team, All-Star) [0]
00-01 Ray Allen (All-NBA 3rd team, All-Star) [10]
01-02 Shareef Abdur-Raheem (All-Star) [8]
01-02 Antoine Walker (All-Star) [4]
03-04 Jermaine O’Neal (All-NBA 2nd team, All-Star) [26]
04-05 Zydrunas Ilgauskas (All-Star, offensive reb leader) [0]

This team has a real shot to win the whole thing. Every single player on the 12-man roster was at least an all-star...2 MVPs + 2 DPOYs in the starting lineup + an MVP off the bench? I think this team has just as much talent as anyone when you look at the whole roster, plus great balance/spacing.

**99**

Starters:
03-04 Baron Davis (All-NBA 3rd team, All-Star, Steals leader) [24]
07-08 Manu Ginobili (6MOY, All-NBA 3rd team, All-Star) [30]
03-04 Ron Artest (DPOY, All-def 1st team, All-NBA 3rd team, All-Star) [24]
05-06 Shawn Marion (All-NBA 3rd team, All-Star) [40]
05-06 Elton Brand (All-NBA 2nd team, All-Star) [39]

Bench:
02-03 Steve Francis (All-Star) [24]
08-09 Jason Terry (6MOY) [8]
05-06 Rip Hamilton (All-Star) [10]
05-06 Andrei Kirilenko (All-def 1st team) [24]
03-04 Corey Maggette (none) [0]
10-11 Lamar Odom (6MOY) [17]
03-04 Jeff Foster (none) [0]

This was the last team to make the cut, and I almost put the Davis/Lillard team over this one, but if you look at the stats, this team deserves it. Their strength is definitely in their depth, not their star power. Jason Terry and Rip Hamilton as the 9th/10th men make them a lot deeper than most teams.

**03**

Starters:
06-07 Kirk Hinrich (All-def 2nd team) [24]
08-09 Dwyane Wade (All-NBA 1st team, All-def 2nd team, scoring leader) [36]
12-13 LeBron James (MVP, All-NBA 1st team, All-def 1st team, PER leader) [38]
06-07 Chris Bosh (All-NBA 2nd team, All-Star) [36]
09-10 Chris Kaman (All-Star) [24]

Bench: 
08-09 Mo Williams (All-Star) [24]
06-07 Leandro Barbosa (6MOY) [0]
14-15 Kyle Korver (All-Star, 3pt% leader, TS% leader) [12]
12-13 Carmelo Anthony (All-NBA 2nd team, All-Star, Scoring leader) [24]
05-06 Boris Diaw (MIP) [0]
08-09 David West (All-Star) [16]
09-10 Kendrick Perkins (none) [6]

Take the Big 3 Miami Heat but revert Wade &amp; Bosh to their primes, give them the perfect PGs for their system, an upgrade at C, the best spot-up shooter ever on the bench, and a scoring champ backing up Bron? Definitely can win the whole thing IMO

**08**

Starters:
10-11 Derrick Rose (MVP, All-NBA 1st team, All-Star) [36]
16-17 Russell Westbrook (MVP, All-NBA 1st team, All-Star, Scoring leader, VORP leader) [34]
13-14 Nicolas Batum (none) [20]
13-14 Kevin Love (All-NBA 2nd team, All-Star) [34]
15-16 DeAndre Jordan (All-NBA 1st team, All-def 1st team, FG% leader) [33]

Bench:
16-17 George Hill (none) [0]
13-14 Goran Dragic (All-NBA 3rd team, MIP) [22]
11-12 Brandon Rush (none) [12]
18-19 Danilo Gallinari (none) [12]
11-12 Serge Ibaka (All-def 1st team, Blocks leader) [18]
12-13 Brook Lopez (All-Star) [8]
13-14 Roy Hibbert (All-Star, All-defensive 2nd team) [7]

Major chemistry issues but lots of raw talent. 2 MVP guards in the starting lineup. 

**09**

Starters:
15-16 Steph Curry (MVP, All-NBA 1st team, All-Star, 3pt leader, Steals leader, Scoring leader, PER leader, TS% leader) [36]
17-18 James Harden (MVP, All-NBA 1st team, 3pt made leader, Scoring leader, PER leader) [36]
16-17 Danny Green (All-def 2nd team) [24]
13-14 Blake Griffin (All-NBA 2nd team, All-Star) [36]
10-11 DeJuan Blair (none) [20]

Bench:
14-15 Jeff Teague (All-Star) [4]
17-18 Jrue Holiday (All-defense 1st team) [8]
17-18 DeMar DeRozan (All-NBA 2nd team, All-Star) [12]
17-18 Tyreke Evans (none) [0]
16-17 James Johnson (none) [24]
13-14 Taj Gibson (none) [28]
14-15 Jordan Hill (none) [12]

Curry &amp; Harden both had insane seasons, and the guard depth on this team is amazing...but the big man rotation is pretty weak. However: 3 &gt; 2, so let’s not count them out

Round 1:

84 vs 08
85 vs 09
87 vs 96
99 vs 03

(POG = Player of the game)

84 vs 08: This is kind of a 1 seed vs 8 seed matchup. Good luck, 08...

Game 1: 84 blew out 08 107-91. Barkley POG, 19/9/4/2s/1b. Russ was one rebound short of a triple double.

Game 2: 84 wins 111-101. Jordan POG with 33 points. Team 84 hit three 3s, which is 3 more than they hit in game 1.

Game 3: 08 with the upset!! 103-90. Believe it or not, it was due to rebounding, as Love, DeAndre, and Westbrook did their thing. POG= DeAndre, 11pts (4/5 FG), 11 REB, 4 BLKs, 0 TOs

Game 4: 84 gains control with a 124-118 win. Hakeem came as POG: 18/14/3a/3b

Game 5: 08 steals another! 126-120. Westbrook = POG with 33/9/6 (5 TOs)

Game 6: 84 put it away with a 103-94 win. Jordan POG with a nice 21p/7r/9a/3s/1b line. 84 was losing going in to the 4th quarter but had a huge comeback thanks to MJ.

Winner: **84**

85 v 09: 2 of the best bigs ever vs 2 of the best perimeter scorers ever.

Game 1: 09 with the 115-111 W. They were losing late, but came back with a 3 point barrage. Curry = POG. 35 points on 7/11 from 3. Karl had 25/13

Game 2: Huge win by 85. 125-102. Malone POG w 37 pts

Game 3: 85 won 99-90. Malone POG w/ 20/11/7. Ewing with 24/14.

Game 4: 84 won by a LANDSLIDE 110-78. Karl got yet another POG with 24/11/7.

Game 5: 85 takes the series with a commanding 122-103 win. Karl gets his 4th straight POG with 21/9/8. Harden went 2/10 on 3s.

Winner: **85**

87 v 96: This is probably the best matchup of the first round. Kobe/Nash vs DRob/Pippen

Game 1: 110-100 for 87. Pippen = POG w a 22/7/2/1/3 line. He also held Kobe to 22 points on 21 shots.

Game 2: 96 with a strong 121-94 victory behind Kobe’s POG 30/5/5 line. Wallace/Camby combined for 4p/24r/6b/5s

Game 3: 96 wins 118-109. Ben Wallace POG with 12/16/2 with EIGHT blocks. Peja had 27, Nash had 22/14. DRob 28/12. KJohnson had 15 assists.

Game 4: 96 wins 110-99. Ben Wallace POG, 7/16 and a monster 9 blocks. Kobe had 17/9/7. Reggie Miller dropped 21.

Game 5: 96 puts it away with a 99-89 win. Camby POG with 11/11 and 5 blocks. DRob had 20/8. Looks like the Ben/Camby frountcourt is capable of hanging with the 80s frontcourts

Winner: **96**

99 v 03: This looks pretty uneven on paper but 99’s D and depth will make it interesting. Artest, Kirilenko, and Marion are all “LeBron Stoppers”

Game 1: 99 came out the gate with a 111-102 upset! Marion POG with 20/13/2s. Brand 17/10/5a. Bosh led both teams in scoring with 27/13. Bron &amp; Wade struggled.

Game 2: 03 with a strong 113-84 W. LeBron was POG, 18/8/10. Wade had 18/9. Melo 12/7 off the bench.

Game 3: 99 comes back to take a 2-1 lead! 118-106. Shawn Marion POG with 17 points &amp; 21 boards(!) Bron &amp; Wade had 20 each.

Game 4: 03 ties it up in a 99-90 W. Bosh POG w/ 19/14/5/2b/2s. Bron with 12/10/9. Wade had 28. 

Game 5: 03 with a 112-103 W. LeBron POG with 14/10/8/3s. Brand had 18/10/5/3b.

Game 6: that’s a wrap. 03 took it 114-96. LeBron = POG on 21/13/5/3s. Wade had 17/10/11. Melo had 19 off the bench. Brand had 22/14/3/2b

Winner: **03**

Round two:
84 v 85
96 v 03

84 v 85: on paper, 84 is the favorite, but 85 looked great in round one against 09.

Game 1: 84 took a 116-104 victory. Barkley was POG with 24/10/4/2b. Jordan with 30. Karl Malone had 20/8/4.

Game 2: 84 is on fire! 119-97 victory for 84. Jordan was POG w 34/6/9. Hakeem 25/14. Karl Malone 19/6/7

Game 3: 85 with a 107-89 upset! Ewing was POG with 25/12/5b. Jordan &amp; Hakeem 22 each. 

Game 4: 84 bounces back big time with a 116-106 W. Barkley = POG, 25/10/2/3b. Jordan had 22/3/4

Game 5: 84 puts it away with ease! 110-104. Barkley grabs another POG, 31/16 (6TOs). Jordan had 27. Ewing had 24/14/4/5b

Winner: **84**

96 vs 03: Kobe vs LeBron. Need I say more?

Game 1: 03 comes out hot, 105-89 W. Wade was POG, 21/7/5. Bron had 13/5/10. Korver = 14 points (4/6 3pt). Kobe 20/5/5

Game 2: 03 with another strong victory. 106-93. LeBron was POG with 23/5/7 on good %s. Wade had 25/5/3.

Game 3: 96 says it’s not over yet as they take a 104-95 W. Kobe was POG, 27/5/5. Ben Wallace had 9/15/2. Wade had 21. Bron had 16. Melo had 5 points &amp; 3 TOs

Game 4: 96 win in a 105-76 blowout! Kobe POG with 24/11/5. LeBron only scored 12 (8reb/7asts). Series 2-2

Game 5: 03 squeaks out a 108-107 W! Wade POG with 26/5/3/3b/6s! LeBron 12/6/9. Melo 16/8 off the bench. Kobe had 16/10/7. 03 was down by 1 with 14 seconds left &amp; Wade hit a jumper from a LeBron assist. Kobe’s rebuttal was blocked by Bosh.

Game 6: 96 forces game 7, 111-108! Kobe POG with 23/6/6. Bron had 23/7/8. Wade had 14/5/7. Wade missed a game winner the final seconds, Ben Wallace rebounded the miss &amp; passed it to Kobe who got fouled &amp; sank both FTs

Game 7: it’s a game 7 and it was a very close one point victory for....96! 96 wins 123-122. Kobe was POG, 25/10/9. Nash had 14 assists. Iverson had 20 off the bench. Bron &amp; Wade had 22 each. Wade missed a go-ahead jumper with his team up by 1. Kobe followed with a game winner.

Winner: **96**

FINALS: 84 vs 96

So we have MJ vs Kobe. Stockton vs Nash. DPOY Alvin Robertson trying to stop the bench duo of Allen Iverson and Ray Allen. DPOYs Ben Wallace and Marcus Camby trying to contain Hakeem and Barkley. I think the SIM gave us the best possible finals matchup. 

Game 1: 96 takes a 90-86 W. Kobe POG, 28 points. Hakeem had 25/14. Jordan &amp; Barkley were just okay. Might’ve had something to do with Wallace &amp; Camby’s combined 11 blocks+ 4 steals. 

Game 2: 96 takes a 2-0 series lead with a 107-92 victory. Jermaine O’Neal gets the tourney’s first POG from a bench player: 21/10 w 5 blks. Kobe had 15. MJ had 17/9/5. Big Ben had 8/14/0/3b/3s. Barkley = 21/13 with 7 TOs.

Game 3: 84 with the 111-84 W. Hakeem POG, 17/13/3/2/1. MJ had 16/4/7. Kobe 16/4/2. Stockton led both teams in scoring with 25 with Nash guarding him.

Game 4: 84 evens the series w/ a 119-86 victory as the home team is 4-0 in this series. MJ POG w/ 32/6/7/3stls. Stockton 14 assists. Kobe had 11 points on 18 shots with 6 TOs.

Game 5: 96 with the 93-90 W. Kobe was POG, 20 points, 5 steals. Peja had 18. AI had 15 off the bench. Jordan had 15/8/6. Hakeem 14/17. Kobe scores 6 points in the final 65 seconds of a close game, going 1-1 and 4-4 on FTs.

Game 6: the SIM must know about game 6 Jordan. 84 won 108-85 with MJ as POG=22/6/9/4/3. Barkley had 18/10/4. Hakeem 15/11. Kobe had 18 on 17 shots, 4 TOs. 

Game 7: This Game 7 finals game was decided by only 3 points! The winner is....96! 106-103. Jordan was the first player in the tournament to win POG in a loss with 38/9/6/5s. Hakeem 18/17. Barkley 14/12/6. 96 won despite Kobe’s 18 on 22 shots + 6 TOs. Nash had 15/11. Wallace &amp; Camby combine for 25p/24r/8b/3s. Iverson dropped 20 off the bench. The score was 99-102 (84/96) with 21 seconds left. MJ stole the ball from Kobe, then his shot was blocked by Big Ben, but MJ tipped in his own miss. Then Kobe was fouled and sank both FTs to put them back up by 3. With no good 3 point shooters on the team, it’s not surprising that 84 clanked the game-tying 3.

Winner: **96**

96 definitely earned this victory by going through the toughest possible path, having to beat both the LeBron/Wade class and the Jordan/Hakeem class, plus Pippen/DRob.

Although his stats are clearly lower than the guards I’m comparing him to, you have to take into account his role and the minutes he gets every night. His Per-36 stats show that he has averaged 25 ppg and 7 apg over the last two seasons. One could only assume that if he had a consistently increased role, his stats would only go up, right?

Well, this season Derrick Rose was frustrated with his role on the Pistons and asked the coaching staff for an increased role, which they gave him. In the month of January, Rose averaged 23 ppg and 6 apg on 51% from the field in about 31 minutes per game, a five minute increase from the past two seasons. 

I argue that Rose has returned to being an All Star level guard in the NBA. Since his late arrival in Minnesota in 2018, Rose has shown he can still score at a consistent level again and should be viewed as a star once again. I’m not saying Rose is better than Westbrook, Dame, or Kyrie, but he’s definitely played at a level that’s worthy of comparison. 

Also, for those who are still concerned over the fact that he’s not “MVP Rose” anymore. I’d like you to consider this, you can take any NBA player that has previously been an MVP and they likely aren’t as good or dominant as they were that season. Rose’s drop off from his MVP year isn’t much of a drop off as many would like to think. I challenge you to watch some games or highlights of Rose from his time in Minnesota and Detroit and compare it to his Chicago days. I argue that the biggest difference in his game is his resistance to dunk, and relying on his shooting a bit more than he used to. 

Overall, I think Rose is still an elite point guard in the NBA and should be viewed as such.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,83361,public,self,"Is Derrick Rose currently on the same tier as Kyrie Irving, Russell Westbrook, and Dame Lillard in terms of the best point guards in the NBA?",0,[],,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/g6sahn/is_derrick_rose_currently_on_the_same_tier_as/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,

Let me put this disclaimer out here I was no fan of Blake Griffin when he was on the clippers. I hated his juvenile actions thought he could be dirty and never gave him the credit he deserved.

When he was on the Pistons I paid for more attention to Blake and was thoroughly impressed from what I saw. His skill, playmaking, BBIQ, leadership, attitude towards being on the pistons, maturity and added three point shot made me come around to him. I even had a wild hot take like “Blake Griffin Had a better season than Lebron”. Unfortunately it looks like Blake Griffin career has been derailed by injuries. 

I thought what if Blake Griffin last year randomly and thought about if he had athleticism from his rookie season how good he would be that’s a MVP candidate forgetting he was already in MVP candidate in 2014 3rd place. After looking up his basketball reference page and considering the amount of injuries he’s had I can’t help but think he could’ve been even better than what I thought. a lot of players mention that when they are injured they do not practice as much don’t get enough reps and it’s hard to improve when you’re recovering.

Hey everyone - I explained James Harden’s incredible ability to put on the brakes and decelerate quickly, a key part of what makes him one of the toughest covers in NBA history, via the lens of biomechanics and sports science.

 Here’s a table of contents, header (sub-headings):

\- 0:00 Intro

\- 0:28 Balance and low center of gravity (balance, get low)

\- 1:00 Coordination and weight shifts (in sync, steps on the brakes)

\- 2:26 Neuromuscular control and eccentric strength (elite control &amp; strength, other examples)

\- 4:15 Harnessing leverage (counterforce braking)

For those at work or the hard of hearing, I've transcribed subtitles on YouTube so sound isn't required.

Summary (will do my best without the visuals): One of James Harden's greatest strengths is his ability to decelerate (slow down) extremely quickly. There's multiple components that give him those incredible ""brakes"". Firstly, he always attacks from a balanced, wide base of support that provides a stable platform to start and end moves and maintains a low center of gravity/mass that improves balance even more and allows him to coordinate sequences and shift weight really quickly. His coordination between upper and lower body is superb and makes for extremely efficient movements and some of the nuances (like maintaining a forefoot position with his back foot) allow him to shift weight extremely quickly and decelerate. Further, Harden has incredible neuromuscular control which is the mind-body system that activates and sequences muscles in preparation for and during movement. When combined with his eccentric muscle control - muscles stretching and coming under tension - it gives him an elite ability to stop quickly. Lastly, he understands how to use leverage and contact to help counteract his forward momentum and pair with his already high level deceleration ability. All these things combine to make him a really difficult ""start-stop"" attacker.

I have taken stats from all the seasons when he has been to finals and took his averages of regular season, playoffs and finals. [Here](https://pastebin.com/5gd7EKxF) is the link to the full results, and below are some comments from me:

**2006/2007 season**

LeBron's first final with very mediocre Cavs against a very strong Spurs team. Getting his team to the final was achievement enough and no one really expected Cavs to win the championship. However, we can see that his performance in the Finals were a lot worse than in the playoffs: **Every single stat** has gone down in the Finals except for turnovers, which has more than double to a whopping 5.75 a game. We shouldn't forget that LeBron was still very young then and the pressure must have gotten to him, but it's safe to say that in the Finals he did not play as good as he did in the rest of the playoffs or the regular season.

**2010/2011 season**

The first final of Miami with the big 3, and they were up against veteran filled Mavs team, so it is no surprise that Heat were heavy favourites coming into the series. However, the underdogs, lead by Dirk, managed to get the ring and delay LeBron's dreams of winning a title for at least another year. Again, LeBron's statistics are not looking good  - on average in the Finals he scored 8 less points, grabbed 2 less rebounds and had more turnovers, even though he increased his FG percentage and had more assists. Once more, James did not deliver when his team needed him the most and so far it looks like he just can't handle the Finals pressure.

**2011/2012 season**

Second season of Miami's big 3 in the Finals and they were matched up with young and full of talent team of OKC. To no surprise, Heat won the series and LeBron finally got his ring. His numbers in this series also look way better than in the previous Finals and give hope that he might have matured enough to carry his team in the Finals. His PPG did not drop as drastically (30pts in playoffs, 28 in Finals) and FG percentage has dropped a little, but almost all other categories have gone up. In 2011 Finals LeBron has performed at a very similar level as he did in the rest of the playoffs and did not *choke* by any means.

**2012/2013 season**

One of the greatest Finals series in the modern NBA with *that* Ray Allen three and all 7 games. Heat have beaten Spurs and LeBron got his revenge for 2007 Finals. Statistically, it is a very similar story to the previous year - the PPG (26 to 25) and FG% (51 to 45) have dropped insignificantly, whereas other stats, namely almost 4 more rebounds, have increased and, for the first time in his career, LeBron had less turnovers on average as compared to the rest of the playoffs. Once again he proved that he was able to perform in the Finals as he did in the Playoffs.

**2013/2014 season**

Second year in a row, 3peat seeking LeBron and Heat met Spurs in the Finals. However, this year the outcome was very different - San Antonio won the Championship and Kawhi  - his first Finals MVP. What is really interesting here, is that it's safe to say that it was his personal best Finals series yet as compared to the rest of the playoffs. He scored more and at a higher efficience, shot 3 pointers over 50% (51.9% to be exact), grabbed more rebounds and had more steals. In 2014 LeBron just couldn't do anything more to help his team, so I would not consider this an underperformance.

**2014/2015 season**

LeBron came home to Cleveland, there he found an all-star in Kyrie Irving and brought with him one more - Kevin Love. Not surprisingly, they got to the Finals where a new western conference powerhouse franchise - GSW - was waiting for them. Without injured Love and Irving, LeBron had to take the team on his back, and that he did, although he could not win the championship. James averaged over 35 points, 13 rebounds and 8 assists and was quite close to averaging triple double in the series. It is also evident that he focused less on defense as both steal and block numbers have dropped. It goes without saying that this was his personal best Finals series statistically and this is the first one where one might say he overperformed.

**2015/2016 season**

Again, one of the most entertaining Finals series in modern NBA era. 15/16 Cavaliers are the only team to this day to come back from losing 3-1 in the Finals and win the ring. It is quite interesting that LeBron's numbers in this series, at least offensively speaking, were not magical. He had 5 more points than he did in the playoffs (although scoring less efficiently) and averaged a bit more rebounds and assists. Block numbers are really surprising though - LeBron blocked (including the Iguodala block) more than 3 times more shots than he did in the rest of the playoffs and that might have been because he had Kyrie and Love healthy, so he could focuse more on the defense. Again, statistically speaking quite a mediocre Finals performance, but by no means an underperformance.

**2016/2017 season**

Third year in a row LeBron's Cavs met Golden State Warriors in NBA Finals. The Oakland team have added Kevin Durant to the roster and became a team that was borderline impossible to beat (Unless their stars got injured, which happened in 2019). They won the series 4-1 despite LeBron's and Irving's efforts to stay alive. Numbers wise, it was not a bad Finals performance by LeBron in any way, as he averaged a triple double (34 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists) whereas all the other stats stayed about the same. Again, he did not pull a rabbit out of a hat, but nobody could call his performance *choking.*

**2017/2018 season**

LeBron's last finals with Cavaliers did not go well at all. After a first game loss caused mainly by JR Smith's shenanigans, the team did not bounce back and were swept by GSW. After the season LeBron made the decision to take his talents to LA and join the Lakers, thus marking the end of Cavs-Golden State rivalry. Again, statistically speaking, his Finals performance was a really good one, averaging 34 points in both Finals and Playoffs on more than 50% FG percentage, while the other statistics categories stayed about the same. Again, as Dyatlov from Chernobyl would say, 'Not great, not Terrible', and certainly not an underperformance.

To conclude it all, if we only looked at LeBron's first two finals, it would be safe to say that he really did *choke* in the Finals, but in the 7 appearances after that he played at least as good as (in many of them, even better than) he did in the Regular Season and rest of the Payoffs, so calling him a *choker* really is not telling the whole story.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,83330,public,self,Does LeBron really choke in the Finals?

The number one issue that could stop Luka from winning MVP is if the Mavs fail to claim a top 3 seed in the league.

I often see online people disparaging MJ's competition and therefore his greatness because of the presumption that the athletes he faced were markedly inferior in terms of speed, agility, jumping ability, etc. to today's ballplayer, but what is evidence for this?

There are studies regarding the plateauing of human athletic performance in Olympic events such as track and field and swimming, see below:

Reference \[A2\] concludes that  ""The pinnacle of atypical T&amp;F performances occurred in 1988, hastening the race toward human limits. This present halt of performances and the previously demonstrated stagnation of WR [\[1\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2808355/#pone.0008800-Berthelot1), [\[3\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2808355/#pone.0008800-Desgorces1) emphasize that our physiological evolution will remain limited in a majority of Olympic events. ""

So my question is how is basketball any different?

Investigating this further, I took a quick look at publically available data compiled from NBA combines which is available from 2000-01 and compared to the most recent data from 2019-20, and in terms of performance metrics measured such as lane agility, shuttle run, three-quarter sprint, standing/max vertical leap, and max bench press the numbers are not markedly different.

I understand there's a greater potential pool of talent to draw from now for basketball teams because of the growth in the sport's popularity, and that certain skills are better developed (three-point shooting and ball-handling), but in terms of raw athleticism, I just do not see the evidence that the athletes that Lebron James is facing are on average that much superior to what Michael Jordan faced. To be clear: I love both of these players and I have little patience for their detractors especially when their arguments are ill-thought-out, I am just trying to substantiate the assumption that today's athletes are so much bigger, stronger, and faster than the 90s era.

Undoubtedly, he absolutely dominated his era. Now there’s the legitimate argument about whether LeBron tops him as the GOAT. My perspective:

Jordan vs. LeBron as the GOAT comes down to one thing: timing. Literally, when they each were born and happened to come in to the League. There’s no way either of them could have controlled that. 

The League has progressed a lot since the 80’s and 90’s, and is filled with more athletic players and the game is all around way more evolved, requires more skill, and is faster paced. The whole “Jordan played against mail -men” argument is overblown, but there is a semblance of truth to it. The competition that Jordan played against is not the same level the LeBron has played against. That is not a knock on Jordan, nor does that automatically dethrone him as the GOAT, that’s just a undeniably relevant factor. 

Jordan was an insane athlete, with an unrelenting work ethic and mindset, and his skills were very fine tuned. He could easily have been able to adapt to today’s game if he played in this era. Would he be as dominate today as before? Most likely. We’ll just never know for sure. 

LeBron is a freak of nature and would have dominated the 80’s and 90’s. But dominated more than Jordan did? Another thing we’ll never know for sure. One factor to note: LeBron is most effective as a playmaker, and when he’s surrounded by shooters who can spread the floor and open the lane up for him to create plays. If he plays in the 80’s and 90’s, it’s less likely that he’s playing with teammates that shoot the 3-ball well and at high volumes, so the floor won’t always be as open for him. 

Both players adapted to the era they played in and dominated. Jordan wasn’t playing to dominate in a heavy 3 point volume era, and LeBron hasn’t been playing to dominate in a rough and gritty era like the “good ole days.” 

In essence, determining a once-and-for-all GOAT is somewhat ridiculous, as the debate overlooks a vital element that is out of the control of all NBA fans, as well as Jordan and LeBron themselves: timing. Had each of their destinies been switched, with LeBron playing in the 80’s-90’s and Jordan playing today, both most likely would have dominated that era as well and we may still be having this debate. 

Timing limits a credible GOAT discussion to respective eras. Jordan was the GOAT of his era. LeBron is the GOAT of his era. And finally, Boban Marjanovic will be the GOAT of his era when it’s all said and done.

I posted a similar thread in r/nba the other day and got a ton of anti-Jordan hate comments, so I’m looking for a more intelligent fact-based discussion.

Most folks like to forget about Jordan’s final two campaigns as a Washington Wizard. While he lacked the high-flying highlights he had in Chicago, he was still effective as a top-tier shooting guard in the league. I compared his numbers from that 2001-02 season to the consensus nine best shooting guards (due to injuries no Oladipo or Klay) in the league’s 2019-20 numbers.

Jordan was pretty inefficient shooting in his first season back from his second retirement, but he still was a solid defender and a well-rounded veteran.

As we’ve seen time and again, the things NBA players value when it comes to ranking players are radically different from the things fans and analysts value. For one, players seem to value innate talent &amp; style of play much more than effectiveness, size &amp; hustle. This is one of the reasons why for example you frequently see players rate Kobe above LeBron. In a way I think NBA players generally evaluate the game in more of a 1 on 1 who is “better” rather than a 5 on 5 “who is more valuable” sense. 

KD, Steph, Klay and Draymond all see each other in practice every day. They know in a 1 on 1 setting Draymond can’t hold a candle to them.

I think it sucks](https://imgur.com/gkKDKng)

**** 

In 1981, the NBA revamped it's process for voting on the MVP. Up until then, it was the players themselves who voted on the award. But beginning in that 1981 season, the NBA shifted the responsibility to a panel of media members. 

Most would agree that it's not ideal that the media votes on these awards. They are, after all, the ones covering the league and its not difficult to see how a conflict of interest could arise (ie, reporters trading votes for access). 

I'm less interested in the conflict of interest (although I think it's important and not talked about enough) than I am with the idea of groupthink among media members. 

####[Using data from basketball-reference, I looked at the number of players each season receiving **at least one first place vote** for MVP.](https://imgur.com/gkKDKng).####

From the chart it's pretty clear to me that there has been trend toward consensus in recent years. Up until the late aughts it was common for 4 or more players to receive first place votes. But lately it's become increasingly rare. 

Consider this: There were just three seasons between 1981 and 2010 in which only two players received first place votes (1986, 1997, and 2000). But since 2010, it's happened five times. This year will likely mark the sixth time its happened since 2010 because Giannis and LeBron are the only two candidates anyone is seriously considering. 

I partially blame social media for this trend. In 2014, the NBA began publicizing the awards and it's likely led to some media members voting in line with their peers out of fear of backlash from the Twitter mob.

Sam Amick of the Athletic [has been quoted as saying:](https://hoopshype.com/2019/04/16/behind-the-scenes-with-nba-award-voters-fear-of-social-media-reprisal-is-real/)

&gt; ""Fear of social-media reprisal, if you will, is real. It’s hard to not see that as a factor... But there are definitely some people who feel that a few years ago, had votes not been publicized, Stephen Curry wouldn’t have won unanimously. In 2015-16, it kind of reached a point where there were no other candidates [perceived to be on the same level] so you were going to look like an idiot if you voted for anybody else other than Steph.”

Nobody wants to get dunked on for voting outside the box. I can sympathize with that. 

But shit, I missed when players like Elton Brand (2006), Jermaine O'Neal (2004), Peja Stojakovic (2004), and T-Mac (2002/2003) were *actually* in the conversation for MVP and accordingly received first place votes. Nowadays, when we talk about who is in the conversation for MVP we're usually only talking about two players at most. 

(To be fair, most of those fringe candidates in the past were likely (we don't know for sure) getting votes from their local broadcasters. However, [the NBA took away votes from local broadcasters votes in 2017.](https://www.sbnation.com/2017/4/4/15182804/nba-strips-local-broadcasters-voting-league-awards))

It sort of surprises me that an alternative NBA Awards ballot voted on by someone other than NBA media members hasn't sprung up.

I've recently been hearing even my casual sports fan refer to this Ewing theory I suppose Bill Simmons created on a blog well over a decade ago. My understanding of this theory is Ewing in his older age was a complete ball stopper and held the team back in some aspects. I will agree with this point, and the Knicks went on to make the NBA finals after he was injured. My main criticism of this is merely the title of the theory. Isn't this a bit unfair to maybe one of the most unluckiest superstars of all time? In all my years of understanding the could of been dynasty Knicks they were held together by Ewing who gave up his body. Sure could he have understood his years were waning in 99 absolutely, but this is the same discussion about every star in the twilight of their career. What are some other stars to better appropriate name this theory? My choice would be Carmelo ala the ""Melo theory"". Easily one of my least favorite players of all time who was considered a ""winner"" the first few years of career.

The Jordan documentary has everyone calling him the GOAT again, and frankly I don't buy it.

I've got Olajuwon 1, LeBron 2, then either KAJ/Jordan at 3/4 depending on the day.

My main reasons are...

1. The public undervalues defensive impact.  Olajuwon is arguably the best defensive player in the history of the NBA.  I don't think it's remotely rational to suggest MJ was close to as good of a defender as The Dream Shake.

2. Olajuwon was the only player in NBA history to lead a team with 0 all stars and 0 Hall of Fame teammates.

3. The 1994 Pippen led Bulls dismantled Jordans aura in my eyes.  Hakeem played on absolute garbage rosters that exploded if he missed any time.

4. Hakeem has a 13-10 record against Jordan despite playing on significantly inferior rosters throughout his career.  He was 8-2 against Jordan during the Rockets peak.  Hakeem didn't get lucky when Jordan retired.  Jordan ducked Hakeem.

Firstly and most obviously: Michael Jordan is 6-0 in the NBA Finals and LeBron James is 3-6. In professional sports, it is obviously incredibly hard to win a single championship, but to go undefeated in championships, with the amount of Finals appearances Michael Jordan had was unprecedented and will likely never be topped. LeBron James, on the other hand, is 3-6. Two positives from this is he has 3 titles, which is a significant accomplishment, and he has played in 9 championships. However, when you look deeper at these championships, he very well could be 1-8 if it weren't for two of the most clutch shots in NBA history. While basketball is a team sport, there is no debating that LeBron is closer to being 1-8 than he is to being 5-4, which would still put him a title off from Jordan.

Secondly, I think it is important to understand just how easy LeBron James has had it in the Eastern Conference throughout his career. The NBA ""Prime"" is considered the age 26 through age 31 seasons. When I take a look at the Hall of Famers LeBron James faced in their prime in the Eastern Conference playoffs, it will likely look like: Vince Carter in 2007 with the 41-41 #6 New Jersey Nets, Carmelo Anthony in 2012 with the 36-30 #7 New York Knicks, and Paul George with the 42-40 #7 Indiana Pacers. I'd also like to point out that he only played each of these players once while they were in their prime, for a combined total of 3 instances of series against Hall of Fame players in their prime. On the other hand, Jordan had 10 instances of series against Hall of Fame players in their prime. To put it modestly, LeBron James has had an easy path to the Finals every year, and his appearances in the Finals with the lack of success in the Finals suggests that.

Finally, everyone wants to bring up stats, and how LeBron James is a passer more than a scorer, but yet he's \*likely\* going to break the NBA record for career points. The main argument for LeBron is that he is a better all-around player. There's a stat for that though, and it's called PER. PER suggests that LeBron isn't the greatest player ever. In fact, Michael Jordan has a regular season PER of 27.9 compared to LeBron's 27.5, and a playoff PER of 28.6 compared to LeBron's 28.3. The numbers don't lie. Jordan is the GOAT.

Granted players back then would adjust, but if iirc (and I don’t remember where I saw the stat), but all stars who played in their primes scored more in 1998-2001 than 2001+ per game less per game 2001/2002 with the rule change (if anyone has the exact stats/list, definitely clue me in).

This isn’t to say they wouldn’t adjust to the game or be great players, but I don’t think you’d necessarily see greats like MJ or Larry or Magic, etc averaging 45 like everyone says.

In NBA 2K20, 32 teams will be uploaded in a roster containing the all-time prime teams, which will be selected from the comments on my previous post.

&amp;#x200B;

**Seating:** 

 

The ""playoffs"" essentially will be with teams seated in regular seating, as if they were in a regular NBA playoff setting, only that with 32 teams, meaning that the 1st seed would go against the 32nd (could be subject to change, if another, a better way is stated in the comments, this is a subreddit thing after all). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Method of Approach:** 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Team seeding will be selected at random, to give each team a fair chance at going against an easier or weaker team overall. 

\- Series will be played to the best of 5, not 7 since it would take up even more time than it already will. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Awards:  Player awards will be awarded after every series of that round.**

\- Round MVP: Given to the player who played the best across all teams (Not necessarily the top scorer) 

\- Team MVP: Same as round MVP, but as it states, relating to the team only. 

\- Dark Horse: The player who played bad the prior round, but improved their play by a wide margin the next round. 

\- Prolific Scorer: Given to the overall best scorer in that specific round. 

\- Finals MVP: Self-Explanatory

&amp;#x200B;

**Stats will be included for every game and every team, but nor for every player.** 

**Stat lines will be included for:** 

\- Top Scorer

\-Top Rebounder

\- Top Playmaker

\- Best Overall player (taking into account everything from FG%, Pts, TRB, Assists, Steals, Blocks, Fouls, TO)

&amp;#x200B;

**If anyone has better ideas on how to run the playoffs, leave your ideas down below.**

&amp;#x200B;

**A team list will be uploaded later on. Teams will have a 9 man rotation.**

Essentially, Cole Zwicker created this archetypes to classify the majority of NBA players. I found them extremely helpful in terms of contextualizing what roles players, particularly potential players, can actually fill. Unfortunately, Cole deleted his site, which was where these archetypes were documented. Through the Wayback Machine, I was able to find the archetypes, but not the detail for them. So I decided to try and flesh them out by memory.

For this post, I'll focus on part two of archetypes for Wings:

***

**Wings, Part Two**
--

Wings are your non-lead guards, non-traditional big men. So, basically shooting guards, small forwards, and “small-ball 4s” (nowadays just regular 4s). This is the largest category, so it gets split in two (pretty sure Cole had a reason for the bifurcation beyond that, but I forget). Archetypes are:

**Two-Way Secondary Scorers/Handlers:** Wings who, while fairly stronger scorers/handlers, don’t quite do so at the volume of a primary offensive option. Also, they are effective on defense. An effective archetype, though I’ve noticed that some of these guys sometimes get paid more like primary options. 

*Examples:* I like Khris Middleton as the prototype for this group. I could maybe see an argument for him approaching primary scorer status, though. Tobias Harris is also a good example. Jaylen Brown has made his way in here. TJ Warren and Will Barton are two other guys who I like in this group. Perhaps Josh Richardson. Caris Levert. Jeremy Lamb is an example of someone who, while more of a bench guy, could fit in. Depending on how you feel about his defense, Bojan Bogdanovic works here.

**One-Way Secondary Scorers/Handlers:** The above category, but not effective at defense. Often includes sixth man types. 

*Examples:* A lot of guys in this group. Lou Williams, CJ McCollum, and Jamal Murray are some strong players who fit in this archetype, though some would perhaps consider them to be more so lead guards. Buddy Hield. Jordan Clarkson. Andrew Wiggins. Evan Fournier. Eric Gordon. Luke Kennard. Kevin Huerter. Tim Hardaway Jr. Bogdan Bogdanovic. Depending on how you feel about his defense, Bojan Bogdanovic.

**Offensive Skilled Combo-Forwards:** Big Wings who are capable of guarding the four on defense and are, well, skilled on offense—more than just spot-up shooters. What places them here instead of the 3&amp;D Plus category is that they aren’t necessarily plus defenders. Not necessarily negative defenders, but their defense is not usually considered one of their core strengths, outside of being able to guard fours. 

*Examples:* Danilo Gallinari is one of the better players in this archetype. Harrison Barnes, specifcally in his role on the Mavs, would fit in. Jabari Parker, as well. Kyle Kuzma, despite his struggles this year. Chandler Parsons occupied this archetype before his knees fully disintegrated. Michael Porter Jr. is someone who I think could end up here.

**Wing Fours:** The above category, but not as skilled on offensive—more so just spot-up guys. What places them here instead of the 3&amp;D Versatile category is that they aren’t necessarily plus defenders. Not necessarily negative defenders, but their defense is not usually considered one of their core strengths, outside of being able to guard fours. 

*Examples:* When he was on the Dubs, this is the archetype Harrison Barnes filled. Michael Porter Jr. played in this role this year imo. Jeff Green is another guy. 

**Defensive Versatile + Non-shooter:** Versatile wings who can guard multiple positions (generally 2-4), but are not capable three point threats. An almost completely unplayable archetype nowadays. 

*Examples:* Andre Roberson is maybe the best recent example of this kind of players. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Rondae Hollis Jefferson, and Justise Winslow as well. Josh Okogie, due to his struggles with his shot, is here as well. When he's not making threes, Al-Farouq Aminu is this kind of player.

**1 Position Defender + 1 Skill Shooter:** Wings who, for the most part, can’t guard more than their position on defense (and not necessarily well) and don’t bring many other substantial skills on offense behind shooting. A fairly difficult archetype to succeed as—if a player in this category isn’t a strong off-motion shooter, they probably won’t be very helpful, and being a strong enough shooter to succeed running around screens is relatively rare. However, these off-motion shooters can be very effective and there seems to be more and more of them. 

*Examples:* Kyle Korver and JJ Redick of course. Late career Ray Allen. Joe Harris and Duncan Robinson as well. Wayne Ellington fell off, but functioned well in Miami in this archetype for a couple of years. Anthony Morrow is a good example of a player in this archetype who was never that helpful, due to not being an off-screen, motion shooter. Furkan Korkmaz and Landry Shamet are two young guys in this role.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,82963,public,self,"NBA Player Archetypes: Wings, Part Two",0,[],,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/g506so/nba_player_archetypes_wings_part_two/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,

-Was not selected as an all-star that year

-Was not selected as DPOY that year

-Would be no greater than the 3rd option on offense in a championship winning team

-Limited role---whether it be low USG%, low offensive production, a certain specialized role, etc.

-Not a player you would build a team around, but rather, the players you use to build around your main stars/superstars---some 
exceptions would be teams like the ‘04 Pistons or the ‘14 Spurs who are a completely cohesive unit

-Preferably a player who plays almost religiously to their strengths, and doesn’t venture to do too much outside of those boundaries

-The exact details of what constitutes a role player is vague, so if you disagree with me on my rules, that’s fine. A lot of this is my own interpretation, so there’s bound to be some disagreement with my arbitrary rules and picks.



**What brought these players to the list?**

-Whether it be a defining playoff moment or series, really good advanced stats, insane efficiency, or using the good old eye test, these players accomplished something noteworthy in each of their respective seasons. There's not enough room to point out every single micro-detail, but I tried to include noteworthy accomplishments where necessary.


------------


**Examples of guys I consider to be a little too good to be considered a role player:**

* Hedo Türkoğlu, 2008---had too great of a role on offense. Was a playmaker and scorer with a fairly high usage rate

* Kawhi Leonard, 2015---took on too much of a role on offense towards the end of the season. Come playoff time, he was the team’s #1 option

* Draymond Green, 2015---his role as a facilitator during the playoffs made him much more than a role player in conjunction with his defense

* James Harden, 2012---was the 3rd option on offense of a championship-caliber team, but the team was very top-heavy for offensive load. Kind of similar to Jason Terry in 2011, but I feel like his role on the team offensively is a step above.

* Manu Ginobili, 2008---check Harden’s thing.


------------


**Really Solid Players with a Hard to Define Role**

* Andrei Kirilenko, 2003 (bench player during this time; still a beast with really good productivity, though)

* Robert Horry, 2005 (check 2005 playoffs BPM, ORTG, &amp; 3P%. Less athletic, but insane playoff production in limited minutes.)

* Kirk Hinrich, 2007

* Jose Calderon, 2009 (best free throw shooting season of all-time at 98%. It’s debatable as to whether or not he’s a “role player” this season, but I’ll say he is)

* Jason Kidd, 2011 (3&amp;D and playmaking)

* Reggie Evans, 2013 (dude just got boards---ridiculous TRB% of 26.7%)

* Kawhi Leonard, 2014 (really good efficiency, elite defense, Finals MVP, but still a role player)

* Andre Iguodala, 2015 (best playoffs---check DRTG, too.)

* Malcolm Brogdon, 2018

* Darren Collison, 2018

* Thaddeus Young, 2018

* Bam Adebayo, 2019

* Paul Millsap, 2019

* Steven Adams, 2020 (solid screens, excellent rebounder, consistent lob threat, plus-ish defender, commits a low amount of fouls)

* Lonzo Ball, 2020

* George Hill, 2020 (insane efficiency)


------------


**Defensive Specialists**

* Theo Ratliff, 2000

* Clifford Robinson, 2000

* Mookie Blaylock, 2001

* Marcus Camby, 2001

* P.J. Brown, 2003 (advanced stats darling)

* David Robinson, 2003 (Even in his final year at 37 years old, DRob was a really solid defender and a plus on the floor)

* Eric Snow, 2003

* Samuel Dalembert, 2004 (AI has always been surrounded by really good defenders)

* Rasho Nesterović, 2004 (sure, it helps that he had KG and Duncan in his early years, but still a really solid defender. Still the best defender when he got to Toronto)

* Alonzo Mourning, 2006 (insane advanced stats; really, really good DRTG of 95 in playoffs)

* Gerald Wallace, 2006 (he was an all-star 2010, which is his best season, but he had too significant of a role that year)

* Tayshaun Prince, 2007

* Ben Wallace, 2007 (I would say 2002 instead, but it’s hard to call a guy who won DPOY a role player)

* Kendrick Perkins, 2008 (allowed KG to roam on defense, making them one of the top 5 defenses of the past 20 years)

* Luc Mbah a Moute, 2010

* Rasheed Wallace, 2010

* Tyson Chandler, 2011 (Like Ben Wallace, I would say 2012 instead, but it’s hard to call a guy who won DPOY a role player)

* Serge Ibaka, 2012

* Joakim Noah, 2012 (insane advanced stats. Wasn’t as involved on offense with playmaking as 2013 &amp; 2014 Noah, so i think it’s fair to call him a role player at this point in his career)

* Roy Hibbert, 2013

* Tiago Splitter, 2014

* Tony Allen, 2015 (""1st team all-defense... 1ST TEAM ALL-DEFENSE!"")

* Andrew Bogut, 2015

* DeAndre Jordan, 2015 (effective in playoffs AND regular season)

* Andre Roberson, 2017

* Rudy Gobert, 2017

* Marc Gasol, 2019

* Marcus Smart, 2019

* Donte DiVincenzo, 2020 (a smaller, Iguodala-Marcus Smart hybrid. Less strong version of Smart on defense, less athletic version of Iguodala on offense. Dude makes winning plays and is constantly making great rotations. Really sound player)

* Dwight Howard, 2020

* Jonathan Isaac, 2020 (it’s too bad his season ended short---this guy was playing like a menace on D)

* Mitchell Robinson, 2020 (most insane offensive rating of all-time [144], wtf)

* Daniel Theis, 2020

* Matisse Thybulle, 2020

**3&amp;D**

* Charlie Ward, 2000

* Rick Fox, 2001

* Bruce Bowen, 2003 (playoffs and regular season. Best efficiency from 3)

2010 - 2011 **DRose** (MVP)

2008 - 2009 **DWade** (Scoring Champ)

2014- 2015 **Kyle Korver** (Lead the league in 3PT% at 49.2%)

2012 - 2013 **Lebron James** (MVP and Finals MVP) 

2013 - 2014 **Kevin Love** (Averaged 26 12 and 4) 

Even the bench wouldn't be bad since it would consist of:

2016-2017 **Isaiah Thomas** (All NBA First-Team)

2012 - 2013 J**.R Smith** (Sixth Man of the Year)

2016 - 2017 **Jae Crowder** (Shot 40% from 3PT and was a very good defender)

2019 - 2020 T**ristan Thompson** (Above Average Center averaging 12 and 10)

This team would work well I believe since Wade and Lebron spent those years in Miami, Drose and those 2 would've teamed up if Melo didn't decide to chase a bag in NY, and Kyle Korver would be the Steve Kerr to them, a 3pt specialist to go to in the clutch. The bench is extremely solid, lacking forwards and centers, but this can be overlooked by the backcourt, which would score tremendously off the bench.

&gt; *If Allen Iverson 
isn't given an opportunity, then he's not much of a player--he doesn't 
really play great defense, doesn't rebound, doesn't make the extra pass all 
that well, and isn't a fantastic outside shooter. But when allowed to 
shine, his skills with the ball allow him to do so.*

&gt; *[...] But for lesser players who need the ball to be successful but don't 
have an Iverson-like pedigree to justify getting the ball that much, like 
Monta Ellis, Devin Harris, Gilbert himself, Nash, and those who still 
haven't gotten an opportunity like Telfair, Shannon Brown, Jared Jordan, 
and Lenny Cooke, they have to wait longer to get their opportunities to 
play their game; for Lenny, it never came, and the sun is setting on 
Telfair.*

This got me thinking who are some active players who are decisively good ""only"" because of their ball-hogging and shooting, without much ability (not to a top-tier level I mean, because obviously to make it to the league you can't just shoot and shoot and shoot, and need other traits) in other parts of the game.

FORMAT

There were 6 teams and 6 rounds: each team was randomly assigned to go 1st in 1 category, 2nd in another category and so on. 

The 6 categories, in order, are: 

* Guard
* Forward
* Center
* Roleplayer (No All Star games or All NBA Teams in their career)
* Wildcard (Any player that hasn't yet been chosen)
* Coach (Had to have coached during this timespan, and specifically refers to their ability to coach in the era mentioned below)

RULES

\- 2014-15 to 2019-2020 seasons only. We can only consider a player's body of work during this time (e.g. Kobe sucked during this timeframe, so nobody drafted him)

\- We focused on peak, though certainly sustained success plays a role (e.g. IT had one season that's up there with a Dame season, but we valued Dame much higher)

RESULTS

Here's the teams we ended up with (along with the names we assigned):

||Dubs 2.0|Defense|Work|LeBrontos|Joel Rockets|Grit N Grind 2.0|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Guard|Steph Curry|Klay |Westbrook|Lowry|Harden|CP3|
|Forward|Draymond Green|Kawhi|Giannis |LBJ|Paul George|KD|
|Center|KAT|AD|Jokic|Marc Gasol|Embiid|Gobert|
|Roleplayer|Zion Williamson|De'Aaaron Fox|Seth Curry|Robert Covington|Conley|Jaylen Brown|
|Wildcard|Marcus Smart|Middleton|Luka Doncic|Damian Lillard|P.J. Tucker|Jimmy Butler|
|Coach|Steve Kerr|Gregg Poppovich|Doc Rivers|Nick Nurse|Mike D'Antoni|Erik Spoelstra|

I was recently watching a highlight video featuring Klay Thompson's 37 point quarter, which got me wondering what the dynamics are like when a player has one of these monstrous occasions.

For example, while NBA players clearly *can* have such incredible performances, it doesn't *always* happen. This made me wonder why, and what's going on with the team when they occur. What primarily defines when a player is going to have a 25pt night vs putting up 50pts? Fleshing out some specific questions:

- is ""default mode"" the team playing more or less as one, sharing opportunities somewhat evenly or purely according to what plays work (scoring from big man plays some games vs. long range shots in others)?
- when the team breaks from business as usual, is this someone going into beast mode (e.g. Kobe getting 81pts because he just decided that's what he was going to do that night)?
- or, is it obvious early that someone is hot/fired up and the team talks about this at some point? Like ""Kobe, you're on fire. Do you want to just keep doing what you're doing?""
- is there disagreement about it? ""Kobe, there's four of us out here too... want to share?"" (and then he doesn't for the whole rest of the game)
- is the event planned (""Kobe, you should run this game"") or does it emerge unexpectedly (like Klay just starts knocking points down and the team feeds him)?

I think there's evidence for the last one for sure. The whole team was clearly giving Klay opportunities to break the record. Dirk's 30k game was another example where the team fed him, even in somewhat awkward manners, to make sure he got there as fast as possible.

For the tl;dr, my pondering was mainly around these two points:

- if an average game is ~100pts and someone knocks down 50pts, the rest of the team will have far less points. What is the dynamic among players with respect to this?
- these monster games don't always happen, so either the best players can't put up these numbers every single time, or they/the teams choose not to use the strategy of a single player getting the majority of their points",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,82813,public,self,What are the team dynamics when a player goes on an insane streak?,0,[],,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/g4gf08/what_are_the_team_dynamics_when_a_player_goes_on/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,

most point guards who were drafted with shot selection issues wind up as shooting guards...like Jamal Crawford, iverson, rodney stuckey etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Coaches tend to view point guards as extensions of what they want to happen on the court and are usually harsher on point guards than other positions when it comes to decision making .

&amp;#x200B;

when i have watched Ball play , the desire to launch shots early in the shot clock and take low percentage runners to me will doom him along with an indifference to defense , i don't see a path to success there as a point guard , even when a point guard consistently makes tough shots like Kyrie Irving , the desire to make things harder than they need to be wears on teammates especially when that player is Ball dominant (pun unintended).

This got me thinking. Most lists I see have him somewhere in the forties, which I definitely think is underrating him.

Obviously, he was one of the game's very best passers, but he was also a top 5 rebounding and defensive guard of all time and an underrated shooter as well. The only thing he wasn't great at was scoring.

He had a fair share of clutch moments in the NBA, and he was one of the most mentally tough players in recent memory.

He has an impressive list of awards and accolades to his name. He won the Rookie of the Year, was named an All-Star 10 times, made 6 All-NBA teams, and 9 All-Defensive teams. He also placed 2nd in MVP voting once, and was arguably robbed of the MVP that season.

Not everyone pays attention to advanced stats, but it's worth knowing that Kidd's advanced stats are indicative of a top 30 player in NBA history.

To show how valuable he truly was, he joined a 26 win team in his prime that basically didn't change much about their roster other than replacing Stephon Marbury with him, and they went on to win 52 games and make the Finals. Speaking of which, he made the Finals twice in his prime with subpar supporting casts and lost to two of the greatest teams in NBA history.

Later in his career, he was a piece of the 2011 Mavericks, who made the greatest playoff run in NBA history and won the championship that year. He might've been 37 at that time, but he was not just a role player on that team like so many think he was. He led the 2011 Mavs in minutes, assists, steals, three pointers, placed third on the team in win shares, and was just one year removed from an All-Star appearance.

Kidd was incredibly valuable in that Finals series, and they probably would not have won without him. He wasn't just a passer, he was shooting the lights out and was the primary defender on LeBron, who struggled mightily.

I can't see how the resume that I just laid out could be worthy of anything worse than top 50 all time. I have Kidd in the late twenties, but I could see how that might be just a tad high, because I'm a Nets fan. I think low to mid thirties would still be fair for Kidd, but anything worse than that would be underrating him in my opinion. What do you think?

&amp;#x200B;

 Or people will focus on on court impact for some players and dismiss that same criteria in place of gaudy stats for another player for instance Steve Nash vs Allen Iverson , Nash in his prime led the Mavericks and Suns to the 1st or 2nd ranked offenses 7 straight years while in Iverson's prime his team's offenses were rarely above 15th and often 23rd or below.

&amp;#x200B;

Some people argue what your skills make up is what really important for instance if you were a closer like Michael Jordan and then dismiss Isiah Thomas who was the best player on 2 title winning teams and has some obviously legendary clutch exploits of his own(like the time he had 25 points in a quarter which is right up there with the ""flu game"" in nba lore

&amp;#x200B;

there are even people who argue about resume and use it to put Jordan at #1 even though Kareem Abdul Jabbar's accomplishments actually are tangibly better (all time points leader, 6 MVP's, 19 time all star, 6 titles, 15 time all nba, 11 all defensive teams would be the all time blocks leader if they counted blocks in his 1st 4 seasons )

I found them extremely helpful in terms of contextualizing what roles players, particularly potential players, can actually fill. Unfortunately, Cole deleted his site, which was where these archetypes were documented. Through the Wayback Machine, I was able to find the archetypes, but not the detail for them. So I decided to try and flesh them out by memory.

For this post, I'll focus on part one of archetypes for Wings:

***

**Wings, Part One**
--

Wings are your non-lead guards, non-traditional big men. So, basically shooting guards, small forwards, and “small-ball 4s” (nowadays just regular 4s). This is the largest category, so it gets split in two (pretty sure Cole had a reason for the bifurcation beyond that, but I forget). Archetypes are:

**Two-Way Primary Scorers/Initiators:** Basically, these are wings who can effectively function as a primary scorer or initiator and are effective on defense. For guys with traditional SF size who fall into this classification, this is, bar-none, the most valuable archetype IMO. They have the size to be legitimately impactful on defense, but not too much that they can’t be big-time perimeter scorers, which is more valuable nowadays. Unlike guards, you generally can’t just throw a bigger player on them (remember LeBron clamping down D-Rose). Traditional SG-sized types tend to be less valuable, but are still generally very valuable. 

*Examples:* LeBron James, of course, is perhaps the most ultimate example of this archetype. Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, and Jimmy Butler are other examples of ""traditional SFs"" who fall into this. Depending on how you feel about his defense, Luka Donic could also belong. Jayson Tatum is someone whose play this year probably merits a mention. For smaller wings who fit, Donovan Mitchell is a strong current example. Victor Oladipo in 2017-18 is also a good fit, though he hasn't quite been the same since.

**One-Way Primary Scorers/Initiators:** The same as the above category, but not effective on defense. This can still be a very valuable archetype, but players who just provide scoring without passing (and no defense, by categorization), often end up highly paid despite having a questionable impact on winning. 

*Examples:* Prime Carmelo Anthony is one of the most notable example of this category. I'd also throw in DeMar DeRozan. Bradley Beal too, maybe. I could see an argument for Zach Lavine. Brandon Ingram is also someone whose play this year deserves consideration. Depending on how you feel about his defense, maybe Luka Doncic slides in here.

**Two-Way Swiss Army Knife Playmakers:** These are versatile, effective defenders; capable three-point shooters; and, while generally low-usage on offense, can playmake for others. This is a quite valuable archetype—while they usually don’t make all-star games or are the driving force behind a team, they are ceiling-raisers and are often found in a team’s most effective lineups. 

*Examples:* Andre Iguodala, specifically in the earlier GSW years, is perhaps the prototype. Joe Ingles and Marcus Smart are two current examples of this archetype, imo. It's hard to think of some other guys. Derrick White is someone who I kind of want to throw in.

**3&amp;D Plus:** The idea of this archetype is that it’s 3&amp;D wings (effective spot-up 3-point shooters and plus defenders), who add on an additional skill on offense that bumps them up a level. This is a pretty sparse archetype. 

*Examples:* Klay Thompson is the ultimate prototype here. Like I said, though, it's hard to think of too many other guys. Pre-achilles tear Wesley Matthews fits. Otto Porter as well maybe.

**3&amp;D Versatile:** Essentially, 3&amp;D combo-forwards, who can switch on to 2s as well as 4s. Valuable archetype, plug-and-play guys who aren’t supposed to have many weak-points on defense. 

*Examples:* Houston wings Robert Covington and PJ Tucker fit. Former Houston wing Trevor Ariza as well, though he's fallen off heavily. Marvin Williams is a dark horse here.

**3&amp;D Perimeter/Point-of-Attack:** 3&amp;D wings who more so spend their time on small 3s, 2s, and maybe 1s—less able to switch on to 4s and may be bullied by bigger 3s. Generally seem to be less valuable than the above category, but still ceiling raisers who contribute to winning. 

*Examples:* Danny Green is the prototype. There are definitely other guys, but I'm blanking right now. I want to say Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, but I'm not certain how actually good at defense he is.

Pretty much every Spurs player fits here. 

Edit 2: just because I’m missing someone doesn’t mean they weren’t consistent. There are a lot of consistent players I didn’t really want to spend time writing about. Feel free to add them in the comments

This one's a shoutout to players who never really had a ""peak"" but were always just consistently good. Players like Kyle Korver have had the greatest longevity in the league because Kyle Korver in 2020 is the *exact same* version of Kyle Korver in 2003, and will always be the exact same version of him. It's basically players who relied less on their athleticism and more on technique and things that don't change with age.

Granted, it's super easy to make this list as a sharpshooter because your ability to shoot doesn't dwindle with age, but still, who are the most consistent NBA players that were pretty much the same in college, their early years, and later in their careers? 

To be clear, I'm not talking about people with the biggest longevity - just people that had the least change in their game from year 1 to their last year.

I'll start (in no particular order):

PGs:

* Steve Nash - age gets to everyone at some point, but he started off his career as a pass-first PG who can score when needed, and the score when needed part increased during his prime and decreased elsewhere.
* John Stockton - see above
* Chris Paul - everyone thought he was getting old last year, but I think the general consensus now is that he was just getting less touches and not playing in a system that suited his style. Still averaging 2 steals/game at the age of 35, amazing passer, and can score when needed

SGs

* JJ Redick - auto bucket. Give him the ball and he'll make it go in.
* Kyle Korver - 3pt machine. Kinda sucky at everything else. At least he's consistent though.
* Klay Thompson - the god of consistency. Defense might stagger a bit later in his career, but he's almost unquestionably the catch-and-shoot GOAT

SF:

* Larry Bird - not the greatest athlete, but used such good technique that even at the age of 35 (his last), he could average an effective 20.2/9.6/6.8 on over 40% from 3. Came in basically having those same stats with more rebounds and less assists, but more or less the same guy from age 23 to age 35.
* Paul Pierce - in my opinion basically a Walmart Larry Bird. Did everything he did, just not at a GOAT level. Not to diminish his skills by any means, but he was a guy who used technique over athleticism to score, rebound, and pass with good D, all at a slightly smaller scale than Bird. He was still averaging 19/6/5 at the age of 35 before going to Brooklyn.

PF:

* Draymond Green - underrated triple-double machine, and while he's still young, he does the same thing every game, which is everything but score. Even with the tank that was the Warriors this season, his game didn't change at all, but without scorers around him, he was less relevant to their optimal play style.
* Dirk Nowitzki - would've been more consistent if he retired earlier, but he came in as a giant 3-level scorer, and stayed that way his entire career. You really can't stay consistent past the age of 35 unless your name is Kyle Korver.
* Kevin Garnett - started getting injured more as he got older, but was still more or less the same player until he was 36. Again, you can't really count anything past that age because you start to lose the basic level of athleticism required to be in the NBA
* Tim Duncan - literally the big fundamental. Was able to play through and still have a HOF career after a meniscus tear early in his career due to his technique and fundamentals. 

C:

* Tyson Chandler - barely ever averaged more than 10 PPG, but even in 2018 at the age of 35, he was grabbing 9 rebounds and playing solid D.
* Rudy Gobert - basically a taller Tyson Chandler.
* Shaq - okay yes his athleticism was a big part of his game, but the man was still an All-Star at the age of 36 and still played two more years with the exact same play style. No jumpshot, just insane size that can destroy you in the paint. Granted, he's not as consistent as the other guys since peak Shaq was way way better than Suns Shaq, but still, his play style never changed throughout his career and it worked out for him.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,82688,public,self,Most consistent NBA Players ever?,0,[],,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/g3sga5/most_consistent_nba_players_ever/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,1587242285.0,

This is the story of 4 time NBA all star, Spencer Haywood.

There will be a well-edited video essay version with visuals and footage of this at the bottom for those who don't want to read this much text or wish to see the story visually.

To understand Spencer, we first must first have to understand his childhood

Spencer was born one of 10 children 3 months early, 3 weeks after his father's funeral. His mom was back within days of the cotton fields of Silver city, Mississippi.  Here she would load one bag over her shoulder with hundreds of pounds of freshly picked cotton, and on the other shoulder she would carry Spencer. At the age of 4,  Spencer was already taking on his own labor in the cotton field, making 2 dollars a day picking from sunset to sunrise utilizing the extra joints in each of his  fingers he was born with. Spencer says in a 2016 interview:

&gt;""I was told as a kid you're going to be the best cotton picker.""  ""Little did I know, that these hands are going to be for something else.""

Once the the day of picking cotton was over, the family would return to their shack with gas or electricity, where they slept 3 to a bed.

&gt;“The rules were different for people like us in a place like that,” Haywood later wrote. “We just lived. You had babies and you worked and you tried to survive.”

They couldn't afford a real basketball so Spencer's first ball was a sack filled with cotton which he and his siblings would shoot into the rim of a barrel hung on a  tree.

At the age of 17 Spencer saved up 17$, which he used to bus to his brother in Chicago, who then moved him to Detroit. Here, his basketball career would start.

When he arrived at Detroit, Spencer could only read at a second grade level, but he found other means of success. Spencer shot up to 6'8, and would begin his basketball Journey. He  would go on to dominate high school basketball in Detroit- bringing his school a state championship. He continued his basketball journey at Trinidad Junior College, on a full scholarship where he was arranged to play by his high school coach, Will Robinson.

In his freshman year at Trinidad he averaged 28 points per game while ripping down 22 boards. That was enough to get Spencer selected to the 1968 Olympic  basketball team where he would survive the tryouts. At 19, he was the youngest to ever do . He lead the team in scoring at 16.1 points per game, on a record at the time 71.9% shooting. He was dominating internationally now along with future hall of fame guard Jo-Jo White; he finished 9-0 in Olympic play.

After his stay in the Olympics he decided to transfer to the University of Detroit for his sophomore season. After his sophomore year was up he signed a significant 1.9 million dollar contract with the ABA's Denver Rockets, with racial tension being a significant factor for his departure from the college game. He became the first underclassmen to play in a professional league. In just his rookie year he would put the basketball  world on notice, leading the ABA in scoring, rebounding, capturing rookie of the year and a most impressively an MVP trophy, again the youngest to do so in the ABA at 21 years old.

At 21 years old, Spencer also made one of the most impactful decisions of his life, although unknowingly. He was the first NBA player to be  offered a shoe deal by a company known as ""Blue Ribbon Sports,"" a company later that would go by ""Nike."" The deal was either $100,000 straight up in cash 10% of the company in exchange for promoting their shoes. Haywood's agent encouraged him to go with the cash straight up, and he did. Although he had no way of knowing at the time, this was a huge mistake. It can be reasoned that he made that right choice of taking the money straight up. Blue Ribbon Sports was a relatively unknown company, only founded 6 years prior to this in 1964. Though, that 10% would now be worth roughly 8.6 billion dollars today. It also is most likely that Haywood would have been bought out before the value was that high, but he  still missed out on a significant amount of money nonetheless.

Haywood's next step was to shock the NBA. Attempting to  make the jump to the NBA without 4 years in college was never done before, but Spencer and the Seattle Supersonics didn't mind. A legal battle between Haywood and the NBA would ensue, little to either party's knowledge that it would lay the ground work for NBA in the next 50 years. Sam Schulman was the owner of Sonics at the time. Sam can now be looked back at as one of the most forward thinking owners in NBA history. He was the first to snatch Spencer with a 6 year 1.5 million dollar contract and they would battle in court together for his right to play in the NBA as an underclassmen. Their main argument was that the four year rule infringed on Haywood's right to make a living, so they filed an [Anti-Trust lawsuit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law)

[The case was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California,](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/401/1204/) which issued an injunction in Haywood's favor (7-2), ruling:

&gt;""If Haywood is unable to continue to play professional basketball for Seattle, he will suffer irreparable injury in that a substantial part of his playing career will have been dissipated, his physical condition, skills, and coordination will deteriorate from lack of high-level competition, his public acceptance as a super star will diminish to the detriment of his career, his self-esteem, and his pride will have been injured and a great injustice will be perpetrated on him.""

In response to this, the league instituted a ""hardship rule"" which would allow players who could prove they needed to play for financial reasons to enter the league early. Now, both leagues were looking at high schoolers for the first time in history, with the ABA’s Utah Stars drafting Moses Malone, and the Philadelphia 76ers of the NBA taking Daryl Dawkins later.

Haywood would be selected to 4 NBA All-Star teams during his tenure with the Supersonics, displaying his grace and finesse with the ball to a range of NBA fans. With his signature turnaround jumper he massacred teams offensively. He was big enough to go over guards and agile enough to go around bigs. In his best season with the Sonics scored 29 points and grabbed 13 rebounds a game. He also lead the Supersonics to their first playoff birth, under coach Bill Russel. He took them to the second round where they would lose to the eventual champions: the Golden State Warriors.

Next season Haywood would be dealt to the Knicks.[All according to an archived New York Times article from Oct. 24, 1975](https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/24/archives/13million-bid-for-sonic-star-knicks-acquire-haywood-in-13million.html)

&gt;""Haywood had expressed unhappiness during the training camp and had asked to be traded to the Knicks.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""When Russell was asked in a telephone interview why he traded Haywood to the Knicks, he replied “I have no conscience. I could have traded him somewhere else for more players, but I didn't want to do that. He wanted the Knicks, and I have a special feeling for him as a person. I also know how great a ballplayer he is and he would be better off financially with the Knicks.”

After 5 injury plagued and under-whelming season with the Knicks, Haywood was dealt to the New Orleans Jazz. His relatively unknown tenure only lasted 34 games,  where he averaged a respectable 25 and 10.

He was next dealt to the Los Angeles Lakers in 1980.

Here, he would team up with an excited rookie from Michigan State known as ""Earvin Johnson"" and established NBA super star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

It is beyond fitting that Haywood and Earvin be on the same team. Earvin had left Michigan as a sophomore to enter the NBA in 1980. The groundwork Spencer had laid many years before was now being seen in person by him in a big way.  Since Spencer's previous legal battles, the L.A Lakers were able to select Earvin Johnson with the 1st pick of the NBA draft, and it would begin their dynasty. It would significantly help Kareem's legacy by having someone who can take some of the offensive load, even if it isn't all scoring. Kareem got an all-time point guard who he would co-lead with to many championships with the Lakers- thanks to Spencer Haywood.

But by the end of his first regular season in L.A, the Hollywood style of life would catch up with Spencer.

He said in a 2016 interview-

&gt;""I tripped on my own shoe\[...\] I fell into cocaine\[...\] by the end of the season it overtook me""

After Haywood fell asleep during a team workout and caused various other disruptions, the Laker's head coach Paul Westhead suspended him after Game 3 of the finals, which the Lakers won in six games against the Philedelphia 76ers.

Things would then take an even worse turn.

[According to an Archived Los Angeles Times article from June 5, 1988](https://people.com/archive/seduced-and-betrayed-by-cocaine-a-basketball-star-rebuilds-his-life-and-earns-the-ring-of-a-champion-vol-29-no-23/) (From Spencer's perspective)

&gt;""I left the Forum and drove off in my Rolls that night thinking one thought -- that Westhead must die."" ""In the heat of anger and the daze of coke, I phoned an old friend of mine, a genuine certified gangster . . .We sat down and figured it out. Westhead lived in Palos Verdes, and we got his street address. We would sabotage his car, mess with his brake lining,"" Haywood recalled. But the mother of the former Olympic basketball star persuaded him not to go through with the plot, threatening to turn him in, he wrote in the magazine.

In a later video interview in 2016 Spencer would say,

&gt;""That was my year in L.A, the best, the worst, and all in between""

Next year Haywood would lay low in Italy, playing 1 season professional there before briefly returning with the Washington Bullets. After retirement Spencer checked into rehab, now saying he's been sober for 2 decades. He was also inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in September 2015.

**Video Essay Version:**  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYMsfcDLQ-Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYMsfcDLQ-Q)

Quick Summary: Spencer Haywood went from the cotton fields of Mississippi to the Olympics, became the youngest ABA MVP, first basketball star to get a ""Nike"" shoe deal, eliminated the NBA's 4 years of college rule, and because of an addiction to coke was  cut from the Los Angeles Lakers and almost hired someone to kill the head coach.

Him breaking the 4 year rule was most soon seen by the L.A Lakers and Kareem-Abdul Jabbar, who took Magic Johnson first in the 1980 draft and started the Laker's 1980 dynasty. This would also ripple through the NBA for years to come with teams eventually primarily drafting freshman and sophomores, even highschoolers like Tracy Mcgrady and Lebron can think Spencer Haywood for their opportunities.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,82670,public,self,One of the Most Impactful Players in NBA History: The Intricacy of Spencer Haywood,0,[],,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/g3qjal/one_of_the_most_impactful_players_in_nba_history/,some_ads,7,148fa422-421d-11e9-8f9d-0e3c3d0fbb30,High Quality,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'Hj-nC4tD0djMOC1VHhi9sk0lIgAfqQ5UMzmRyffJ9jc', 'resolutions': [{'height': 70, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/1OnqIwPyN1icjPbsZWCt-GiZp6YLCO3wpeykD1naoNE.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a652db8ecc34264d7a794f245fa129b4be17b4b', 'width': 108}, {'height': 140, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/1OnqIwPyN1icjPbsZWCt-GiZp6YLCO3wpeykD1naoNE.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a46898cdea9b2b8fcadb6ee89b7cf821e7e9687e', 'width': 216}, {'height': 208, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/1OnqIwPyN1icjPbsZWCt-GiZp6YLCO3wpeykD1naoNE.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70710f5f4198da1ba1afcee86cc5f2f36162b2fe', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 397, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/1OnqIwPyN1icjPbsZWCt-GiZp6YLCO3wpeykD1naoNE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=2bb9f7782e0bf86552ebf364655e230ecec78064', 'width': 610}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,

I don't obsess over stats, but to a certain extent numbers don't lie. He's the all-time leader by far in both career assists and steals, with career shooting percentage above 50% and above average percentages from the three point and free throw lines as well. Yet somehow he seems to not ever be mentioned among all-time greats at his position. 

Yes I know he never won a title, but he reached the finals twice and lost to Michael Jordan's Bulls both times - who are obviously among the greatest championship teams of all time. Unless we're going to say the same thing about other guys who were blocked by Jordan from titles like Patrick Ewing, Charles Barkley, Gary Payton, Reggie Miller and Karl Malone, I don't think Stockton's lack of a title can be used against him in the all-time debate. 

So objectively where does he rank? 

My point guard list looks like this: 

1. Magic Johnson
2. Stephen Curry
3. Gary Payton
4. John Stockton

I'm finding it really hard to name more than 3 guys I'd definitely take over Stockton, though I acknowledge there are a ton of guys who'd have strong arguments. Steve Nash won two MVPs (though at least one of them is highly questionable) and he helped revolutionize the game. Isiah Thomas (the older/original one) is heavily underrated as well. 

I really think the only thing Stockton's game lacked is a certain ability to elevate. He could do everything the team needed, *except* go off for 40 points. And at the end of the day, getting more buckets is what it's all about. But still, Chris Paul probably fits the same profile, so modest scoring abilities isn't a disqualifier either. 

I can't see how Stockton is not a Top 5 point guard all-time, easily.

And we all know that the traditional big for nothing center is dead in the current NBA environment. But I think the 2-2-3-3-4 is going to be the new line up for the NBA in the next couple decades...here is my ideal line up for a championship team.  

A. A small forward who dribbles the ball down. Even if they pass the ball when they break half court, the threat of them blowing by the defending point guard and breaking down a defense is such a threat. Think LeBron, Ben Simmons, Luka.  
B. A guard who can explode to the basket and make ridiculous plays or passes. I think this is where point guards will slot eventually. They will not be there to make passes and rack up assists, they will be the #1 play maker with scoring as the first priority and passing as a second. Think Kemba Walker, Kyrie Irving, Russel Westbrook.  
C. A guard who can shoot, and shoot anywhere. That’s it, they can also drive and play make, but dang they can shoot. Think Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, James Harden.  
D. A forward who can also shoot from 3. This player does not have to be spectacular, but a big body that can hit from outside, along with the guard and small forward would be overkill. Think Danny Green, Kyle Korver, Klay Thompson.  
E. Last is a big, bully, hard working forward. This guy will replace the center. Explosive, mean, chases down balls. There is no need for a 7’2 center when you have a 6’8 bulldozer who will chase a ball out of bounds. Think Draemond Green, Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis.  

Please tell me your ideal line up, but i feel like the height distribution of the NBA is closing and we are going to see more and more 3’s dribble the ball down, with the shortest guy on the court being maybe 6’4, and the tallest being 7’0, those 7 footers will be exceptions like Giannis.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,82618,public,self,2-2-3-3-4...new NBA line up norm?,0,[],,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/g3gq32/22334new_nba_line_up_norm/,some_ads,7,b72da566-2be3-11ea-ace5-0e1f5652623f,Basketball Strategy,,,,,,,,,

This piece is not to be confused with my MVP race or my orderly rankings of players based on talent; this is strictly from what we witnessed through the majority of a full NBA season, or just about 65 games (give or take) per team.

*\*ALL STATS BASED ON AVERAGES PER 100 POSSESSIONS\**

&amp;#x200B;

**Honorable Mention:** *Hassan Whiteside, John Collins, Collin Sexton, Gordon Hayward, Serge Ibaka, Dennis Schroder, Tobias Harris, Devonte Graham, Eric Bledsoe, Caris LeVert*

&amp;#x200B;

***50. PF/C Montrezl Harrell*** *(63 games played) – 58.0 FG%, 6.2 FTM, 31.6 PTS, 12.0 REB, 1.9 BLK*

Harrell is set to become an unrestricted free agent this offseason and is sure to attract major interest from teams that could use one of the league’s more active and aggressive big bodies. He perhaps took over the reigns from teammate Lou Williams as the league’s most valuable sixth man this season.

&amp;#x200B;

***49. SG Buddy Hield*** *(64 games played) – 3.5 3PM, 39.5 3P%, 30.2 PTS, 7.3 REB, 4.7 AST*

There was apparently a lot of uncertainty swirling around the Kings organization. From Hield anxiously expressing he wanted an extension to him eventually coming off the bench toward the latter part of the season, the Kings maintained their status as a mystery that cannot yet be solved.

&amp;#x200B;

***48. G Jamal Murray*** *(55 games played) – 45.5 FG%, 28.3 PTS, 7.3 AST, 5.9 REB, 1.8 STL*

The 23-year-old Murray has yet to average 20 points in a season but it seems inevitable it will happen one of these years. The only thing holding him back is the Nuggets’ system. They have six players averaging double-figures and nine players averaging at least seven points per game. They share the ball as well as any team in the league.

&amp;#x200B;

***47. PG Malcolm Brogdon*** *(48 games played) – 49.1 2P%, 89.5 FT%, 25.9 PTS, 11.4 AST, 7.5 REB*

Because Brogdon stayed all four years in college, he already figures to be at the beginning of his prime in only his fourth year since he’s 27 years old. We really don’t know how much Brogdon’s departure from Milwaukee actually affected the Bucks. Only the playoffs could have confirmed if in fact they were really missing him.

&amp;#x200B;

***46. PF/C LaMarcus Aldridge*** *(53 games played) – 1.7 3PM, 38.9 3P%, 27.4 PTS, 10.7 REB, 2.4 BLK*

Before the Spurs’ disappointing 2019-20 campaign, Aldridge hadn’t experienced a losing record since the 2012-13 season. That really changes the outlook of the type of season he was having. The Spurs’ new “Big Fundamental” because of his old-school playing style, Aldridge can still explode for 40 points any given night.

&amp;#x200B;

***45. PF Kevin Love*** *(56 games played) – 4.0 3PM, 37.4 3P%, 27.0 PTS, 15.0 REB, 4.9 AST*

Love certainly doesn’t have the upside he once did but is one of the last players that had to worry about adapting to the new NBA. He has been more than comfortable shooting the three-ball nearly his whole career. Now he has gotten to a point where he can create and step in to his own perimeter shots instead of strictly catch-and-shoot.

&amp;#x200B;

***44. SF/SG Andrew Wiggins*** (*54 games played) – 2.8 3PM, 50.6 2P%, 29.6 PTS, 6.9 REB, 5.0 AST*

The $122 million remaining on Wiggins’ contract was anything but easy to move. However, the Timberwolves found the right team that was willing to take him and now he couldn’t possibly be in a more favorable situation. Should Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson get back to full strength, Wiggins has a glaring opportunity to make a name for himself.

&amp;#x200B;

***43. C Andre Drummond*** *(57 games played) – 53.3 FG%, 26.4 PTS, 22.6 REB, 2.8 STL, 2.4 BLK*

Drummond has long proved he’s easily the most dynamic rebounding big man in the NBA. He averaged over 15 rebounds for the third straight year. The Pistons had no choice but to move on as his market was watered down. Not that he isn’t an All-Star caliber player; big men like Drummond are just being tested in today’s perimeter-oriented game.

&amp;#x200B;

***42. PG Derrick Rose*** *(50 games played) – 49.0 FG%, 87.1 FT%, 34.3 PTS, 10.5 AST, 1.5 STL*

Not only did he show flashes of the former MVP, but Rose actually was that exact player at times this year. The only difference is he’s eight years older and makes a lot more sense on a team that has a chance to compete at a high level. His per-minute production was amongst the best of his career. Based on this season, D-Rose still has a lot to offer.

&amp;#x200B;

***41. PG De’Aaron Fox*** *(45 games played) – 47.5 FG%, 31.5 PTS, 10.4 AST, 6.2 REB, 2.2 STL*

Fox was the third point guard selected in the 2017 draft behind Markelle Fultz and Lonzo Ball. Through three years, Fox has hands-down been the best of that trio. Fox wasn’t talked about a whole lot this year but quietly showed some growing strides while having a solid season individually.

&amp;#x200B;

***40. G Shai Gilgeous-Alexander*** *(63 games played) – 51.1 2P%, 26.7 PTS, 8.4 REB, 4.6 AST, 1.5 STL*

Usually I’m not one to drool over one game. But with S.G.A.’s 20-point/20-rebound effort, this is something to make a lot of. When do you see guards corral in 20 rebounds in one game? Gilgeous-Alexander figures to be the future of the OKC franchise – and maybe the present too if Chris Paul ever gets traded.

&amp;#x200B;

***39. F Bojan Bogdanovic*** *(63 games played) – 4.4 3PM, 41.4 3P%, 29.8 PTS, 6.1 REB, 3.1 AST*

Bogdanovic has gradually developed into one of the most electrifying foreign players in the league. Here’s what’s not at all foreign to him – that’s joining a new team. Bogdanovic was welcomed in Utah with open arms and immediately given the green light to be a catalyst of this offense while enjoying a career season.

&amp;#x200B;

***38. SF/SG Jaylen Brown*** *(50 games played) – 3.0 3PM, 49.0 FG%, 29.0 PTS, 9.0 REB, 1.6 STL*

Brown was highly efficient on both sides of the ball but largely overshadowed by the stardom of Jayson Tatum. Brown doesn’t have all the offensive ability that Tatum does but he is probably just as important to the Celtics’ success. He wasn’t known as a dangerous 3-point shooter entering the league but he has steadily gained traction as one.

&amp;#x200B;

***37. PF/C Kristaps Porzingis*** *(51 games played) – 3.8 3PM, 47.7 2P%, 29.7 PTS, 14.6 REB, 3.2 BLK*

We wouldn’t have concluded this when Porzingis was the man in New York. However, it appears he might actually be better suited as a second-fiddle behind a star like Luka Doncic. It’s well-known the Mavs live and die with the offensive firepower of Doncic but Porzingis should keep improving due to his complicated recovery from a torn ACL.

&amp;#x200B;

***36. PG D’Angelo Russell*** *(45 games played) – 5.2 3PM, 34.0 PTS, 9.3 AST, 5.8 REB, 1.9 STL*

Minnesota’s acquisition of Russell may have been one of the least surprising blockbuster trades in recent history. The rumor around the league was that Russell was just viewed by the Warriors as an asset. That turned out to be true and now he is in an enticing situation with a chance to help turn this Wolves franchise around alongside Karl-Anthony Towns.

&amp;#x200B;

***35. G Jrue Holiday*** *(55 games played) – 50.2 2P%, 25.9 PTS, 9.1 AST, 6.4 REB. 2.2 STL*

It slightly bothers me that people are starting to get away with not considering Holiday one of the best two-way players in the league. Make no mistake; Holiday shows very few flaws, if any at all, and is still a tremendous two-way player, and not just compared to other point guards.

&amp;#x200B;

***34. G Spencer Dinwiddie*** *(64 games played) – 8.3 FTM, 48.5 2P%, 31.4 PTS, 10.3 AST, 5.3 REB*

Dinwiddie has come a long way from being a fringe roster player to one of the league’s ultimate crunch-time threats. He ranks top ten in total points in the clutch as well as third in free throws made in the clutch. Still, Dinwiddie is a healthy Nets team’s third most-talented option at best and has been verbal at times about how disrespected he is.

&amp;#x200B;

***33. PG Kemba Walker*** *(50 games played) – 5.0 3PM, 86.7 FT%, 32.2 PTS, 7.5 AST, 6.2 REB*

Despite recently making his fourth consecutive All-Star appearance, Walker was somewhat flying under the radar as a low-key top-ten point guard and nothing more. None of that really matters though because it was expected his offensive volume would take a hit with his new team and he was doing a great job leading by example.

&amp;#x200B;

***32. C Karl-Anthony Towns*** *(35 games played) – 4.5 3PM, 41.2 3P%, 36.2 PTS, 14.8 REB, 6.0 AST*

Just a few months ago, K.A.T. encountered his first significant injury of his professional career. As evidenced by his statistics, Towns had molded himself into an unconscious jump-shooter and that almost makes you forget about the damage he can do in the low-post as well. He probably deserves more attention as part of the NBA’s elite.

&amp;#x200B;

***31. SF Paul George*** *(42 games played) – 39.9 3P%, 34.0 PTS, 9.3 REB, 6.3 AST, 2.2 STL*

After missing about the first quarter of the regular season, P.G. was starting to pick up some steam and he seemed plenty content taking a backseat to Kawhi Leonard. George was still hoisting up nearly eight 3-pointers per game and connecting on them at a more-than-respectable rate. It was all about the playoffs this time around.

&amp;#x200B;

***30. SG CJ McCollum*** *(62 games played) – 3.7 3PM, 38.0 3P%, 29.8 PTS, 5.7 AST, 5.4 REB*

In a brief six-game stretch without Damian Lillard in the lineup, McCollum proceeded to average 33.3 points on 40.6% 3-point shooting to go with 8.3 assists during that span. The Blazers are obviously much better off with its backcourt in full-throttle but that small sample size does show what C.J.M. is capable of despite never making an All-Star team.

&amp;#x200B;

***29. SG/SF DeMar DeRozan*** *(61 games played) – 7.8 FTM, 52.6 FG%, 31.0 PTS, 7.9 REB, 7.8 AST*

The main story about DeRozan hasn’t been his rare mid-range shooting efficiency. Instead, it’s been regarding the likelihood he would opt out of the final year of his contract to sign elsewhere following the season. DeRozan is 11 years deep in this league with seven straight seasons of more than 20 points per game. He shouldn’t be taken for granted.

&amp;#x200B;

***28. C Nikola Vucevic*** *(54 games played) – 2.3 3PM, 52.3 2P%, 29.1 PTS, 16.5 REB, 5.6 AST*

Vucevic failed to make back-to-back All-Star appearances because of players like Bam Adebayo and Domantas Sabonis who took his shine. Nevertheless, it goes without saying the Magic desperately needs the 29-year-old big man to ensure locking up a playoff spot. It’s plain and simple; Vucevic is a model of consistency for this franchise.

&amp;#x200B;

***27. PG Ja Morant*** *(59 games played) – 49.1 FG%, 36.7 3P%, 27.4 PTS, 10.8 AST, 5.5 REB*

The rookie phenom wasted no time turning in some stellar performances early in the season. Morant was the primary component to the Grizzlies being possibly the league’s biggest surprise. It’s very possible they could have fallen out of the playoffs but at least we know what’s in store for this “rebuilding” organization.

&amp;#x200B;

***26. SG Zach LaVine*** *(60 games played) – 4.3 3PM, 35.3 PTS, 6.7 REB, 5.9 AST, 2.0 STL*

LaVine was top ten in the league in usage rate ahead of the likes of LBJ, Lillard, and many others. The impact he made a nightly basis was perhaps too unnoticed because he was lost in the disarray of this underachieving Bulls team. LaVine’s future in Chicago seems murky and it probably wouldn’t hurt for him to play alongside an experienced All-Star.

&amp;#x200B;

***25. F/PG Ben Simmons*** *(54 games played) – 58.5 FG%, 22.7 PTS, 11.1 AST, 10.6 REB, 2.9 STL*

Simmons averaged 21.6 points (65.3 FG%), 9.3 rebounds and 7.9 assists in a nine-game span in January without Embiid. Scoring was way up, rebounds were up, and assists were just barely down. Embiid handles the ball more than some people realize. Ask yourself: would things really be drastically different if Simmons played with Nikola Jokic instead?

&amp;#x200B;

***24. PG Kyle Lowry*** *(52 games played) – 50.5 2P%, 86.1 FT%, 25.8 PTS, 10.0 AST, 6.3 REB*

Reigning champion Lowry was one of four players to average 36 minutes per game and had the Raptors playing some of their best basketball ever (Kawhi Leonard included). Although he’s had some pretty good backcourt mates, Lowry doesn’t necessarily need a top-notch shooting guard to maintain some of the best backcourt stability in the NBA.

&amp;#x200B;

***23. G Donovan Mitchell*** *(63 games played) – 3.5 3PM, 45.3 FG%, 34.3 PTS, 6.2 REB, 5.9 AST*

Mitchell is purely gifted in that he’s listed just over six-feet tall but can really play point guard, shooting guard, as well as small forward if his team really needs him to. He was basically replicating his play from last year statistically but that extra year of experience helped earn him his first All-Star nod. The big question: is Mitchell a true franchise player?

&amp;#x200B;

***22. C Joel Embiid*** *(44 games played) – 2.0 3PM, 37.7 PTS, 19.0 REB, 5.0 AST, 2.1 BLK*

Due to his shaky injury history, Embiid is probably one of those players who will always have to utilize the “load management” tactic. It would be pretty hard to argue he isn’t the best overall center in the NBA if you aren’t counting Anthony Davis. Whether positive or negative, it regularly seems there are alternate story-lines surrounding Embiid.

&amp;#x200B;

***21. PG Trae Young*** *(60 games played) – 4.5 3PM, 10.6 FTM, 39.1 PTS, 12.3 AST, 5.6 REB*

Although he has drawn early-career comparisons to Steph Curry, it might be ill-advised to compare Young with any single player. Just as Curry paved the way for many sharpshooting point guards like him, Young is also the first of his kind since obviously no other player in history has attempted over nine 3-pointers per game in year two.

&amp;#x200B;

***20. C Rudy Gobert*** *(62 games played) – 69.8 FG%, 5.2 FTM, 21.3 PTS, 19.3 REB, 2.8 BLK*

Gobert’s game might not be as flashy as most guys on this list but he reigns supreme when it comes to overall efficiency. He and Anthony Davis were the only two players in the league with at least six offensive win shares and four defensive win shares. I’m not huge on metrics but it shows Gobert is much more than just a rim protector.

&amp;#x200B;

***19. PF/C Domantas Sabonis*** *(62 games played) – 54.0 FG%, 72.3 FT%, 25.9 PTS, 17.4 REB, 7.0 AST*

The Pacers have had a large void to fill with Victor Oladipo missing much of the last two years. Sabonis has assumed many of those responsibilities. He was part of the return from trading their former franchise player Paul George. Sabonis, a cognizant playmaker and franchise player himself, figures to be entering his prime in the next few years.

&amp;#x200B;

***18. F/SG Brandon Ingram*** *(56 games played) – 3.3 3PM, 38.7 3P%, 32.7 PTS, 8.4 REB, 5.8 AST*

The trade to New Orleans has allowed Ingram to break of of his shell and unleash his natural scoring abilities. Those were also visible in Los Angeles but he needed more freedom with the ball in his hands. Ingram is now seen as a walking bucket, one who demands full attention from the defense. He’s in a much better situation with the Pelicans.

&amp;#x200B;

***17. C/PF Bam Adebayo*** *(65 games played) – 56.7 FG%, 23.1 PTS, 15.0 REB, 7.3 AST, 1.7 STL*

Adebayo and Duncan Robinson were the two young Heat players to surprisingly emerge on the scene while both appearing in all 65 games. If you take any Bucks players out of the equation, Robinson/Adebayo was statistically one of the strongest duos in the Eastern Conference. Who would have ever thought?

&amp;#x200B;

***16. F Jayson Tatum*** *(59 games played) – 4.0 3P, 39.8 3P%, 32.9 PTS, 9.9 REB, 2.0 STL*

Building off my commentary for the Miami players, Tatum and Kemba Walker had the best net rating of any non-Bucks player to play at least 1,000 minutes together in the Eastern Conference. That was all made possible because Walker didn’t mind being a part of the well-oiled engine instead of running the show like he did in Charlotte.

&amp;#x200B;

***15. G Russell Westbrook*** *(53 games played) – 51.8 2P%, 35.5 PTS, 10.4 REB, 9.0 AST, 2.1 STL*

Although Harden’s heroics were perhaps more recognized, Westbrook was playing phenomenal basketball in the new year while averaging well over 30 points and shooting well over 50 percent since then. Harden and Westbrook is something we had seen before but way back when. This version of the Harden-Westbrook backcourt was on a new level.

&amp;#x200B;

***14. SF/SG Khris Middleton*** *(55 games played) – 3.7 3PM, 41.8 3P%, 32.0 PTS, 9.4 REB, 6.2 AST*

Middleton has made back-to-back All-Star appearances. Although that’s one the only achievements by his name, defining him as any two-time All-Star would be an understatement. Through 65 games, Middleton was nearly on pace to join the infamous 50 FG%, 40 3P%, 90 FT% club. A championship would bring him the respect he deserves.

&amp;#x200B;

***13. PG Chris Paul*** *(63 games played) – 48.9 FG%, 90.0 FT%, 27.1 PTS, 10.4 AST, 7.5 REB*

Paul has once again been amongst the league’s most clutch players this year and finds himself in good company with teammates Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Dennis Schroder and Danilo Gallinari. If not for CP3 though, those guys wouldn’t be in that group. Paul has played more minutes in the clutch than anyone and shoots 53.5 percent during that time.

&amp;#x200B;

***12. G Devin Booker*** *(62 games played) – 48.7 FG%, 91.6 FT%, 34.2 PTS, 8.6 AST, 5.5 REB*

The Suns might still have a ways to go until playoff contention but they were on pace for over 30 wins for the first time since 2014-15 and the first time in Booker’s career. If scoring is his number one goal then Phoenix is the place to be. But I’m pretty sure winning is his priority as he rarely overshoots – has attempted 20+ shots in less than half of his games.

&amp;#x200B;

***11. SG Bradley Beal*** *(57 games played) – 3.9 3PM, 45.5 FG%, 39.6 PTS, 7.9 AST, 5.5 REB*

Not only did Beal record 50 points in back-to-back games – but it was also the first time it had been done in consecutive nights since Kobe Bryant in 2007. Beal’s workload the last couple of years (36+ minutes per game in each of last three seasons) hasn’t been the most manageable but he has managed just fine while missing very few games.

&amp;#x200B;

***10. F Pascal Siakam*** *(53 games played) – 2.9 3PM, 45.9 FG%, 31.8 PTS, 10.1 REB, 4.8 AST*

Siakam was named the league’s Most Improved Player last season. Although it doesn’t work that way, his improvement this year could have made him a noteworthy candidate for that award again. Siakam was barely a relevant role player two years ago before winning a championship in 2019. He was well on his way toward an All-NBA selection this year.

&amp;#x200B;

***9. PG Damian Lillard*** *(58 games played) – 5.0 3PM, 39.4 3P%, 37.3 PTS, 10.1 AST, 5.6 REB*

Going from a conference finals trip to fighting an uphill battle for eighth seed in one year had to be disappointing for Lillard. That leads to the question: was the Blazers’ postseason run last year more of a fluke than an actual destiny? The Blazers can’t afford to be stuck in the middle of the pack as the unstoppable point guard nears 30 years old.

&amp;#x200B;

***8. G/SF Luka Doncic*** *(54 games played) – 9.9 FTM, 46.1 FG%, 41.7 PTS, 13.5 REB, 12.7 AST*

Doncic was the 21-year-old sensation behind the most efficient offense in NBA history. He was leading all players with 14 triple-doubles. However, it was his *triple-double-ish* stats that won games for the Mavericks, meaning eight rebounds and assists would get the job done too. Doncic’s team success made him almost unarguably a top-five MVP candidate.

&amp;#x200B;

***7. SF/SG Jimmy Butler*** *(54 games played) – 10.8 FTM, 28.9 PTS, 9.5 REB, 8.7 AST, 2.4 STL*

Miami is the third different team where Butler has averaged 20 points per game. He is extremely confident with the ball in his hands at the end of games but he’s never been the type to push himself to the brink when it comes to scoring load. He leaves that for other areas such as defense and intangibles.

&amp;#x200B;

***6. C Nikola Jokic*** *(65 games played) – 1.7 3PM, 52.8 3P%, 30.9 PTS, 15.6 REB, 10.5 AST*

This Nuggets team has gradually improved over the past five years and is at the point where anything less than a conference finals appearance would be unsatisfactory. The problem with that is the Lakers, and the Clippers, and the Rockets, and the Jazz, etc. Jokic is the foundation here and they will go as far as he and Jamal Murray take them.

&amp;#x200B;

***5. G James Harden*** *(61 games played) – 12.8 FTM, 5.6 3PM, 43.5 PTS, 9.3 AST, 8.0 REB*

We can look at one or two seasons but the fact is Harden has strung together several seasons of incomprehensible scoring numbers. His rare playing style makes him unique in some fashion and he has no problem whatsoever lasting the grind of 82 games in the regular season. All eyes are on what Harden will or won’t change in the playoffs.

&amp;#x200B;

***4. PF/C Anthony Davis*** *(55 games played) – 51.1 FG%, 84.5 FT%, 37.0 PTS, 13.0 REB, 3.4 BLK*

Now that Davis is a Laker, it’s his turn to be Shaquille O’Neal’s successor. He’s not quite the man in the middle on offense though. Rather, he’s taken the regime of Tim Duncan or Kevin Garnett, one that screams: “I’m playing power forward but I know every other center is scared of me.” This season ended too soon for everyone but especially for A.D.

&amp;#x200B;

***3. SF Kawhi Leonard*** *(51 games played) – 3.1 3PM, 88.9 FT%, 39.3 PTS, 10.7 REB, 7.3 AST*

You think Leonard takes his matchups with LeBron James personally? Leonard’s offensive game will probably never quite match the totality of LBJ’s but his rugged competitiveness and urge to never back down is what separates him from the rest of the bunch. Leonard was anxiously awaiting another playoff series between the two.

&amp;#x200B;

***2. SF/PG LeBron James*** *(60 games played) – 3.0 3PM, 49.8 FG%, 35.1 PTS, 14.5 AST, 10.7 REB*

The notion that defenses have to “live with James shooting the outside jumper” is still around and will never vanish, even with how far his jumper has come. James was knocking down a pair of 3-pointers per game for the second straight year. The combination of him relying on his outside jumper with him leading the league in assists is downright scary.

&amp;#x200B;

***1. F Giannis Antetokounmpo*** *(57 games played) – 2.2 3PM, 54.7 FG%, 43.8 PTS, 20.3 REB, 8.5 AST*

There is no player outside of Andre Drummond that’s more consistent at crashing the defensive glass than Antetokounmpo. His rebounding makes him a threat to attack full-court leaving the defense few options. Would it make sense to say he’s rebounding the ball a bit too much? Playing off the ball more could actually bolster his 3-point stroke.",False,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,82612,public,self,My top 50 players of the suspended 2019-20 season,0,[],,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/g3fjcb/my_top_50_players_of_the_suspended_201920_season/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,

Hey everyone - I took a detailed look at Kyrie's ability to stop on a dime and change direction via the lens of biomechanics and sports science, including key mental and physical components of his movement mechanics. Thanks to the mods for letting me post.

Here’s a table of contents, header (sub-headings):

\- 0:00 Intro

\- 0:22 Mental speed (Perceive, process, act)

\- 1:14 Balance and coordination (stability, elite full body coordination)

\- 2:15 Center of gravity (low center of mass/gravity, maintaining the low position)

\- 3:04 Weight shift and elastic recoil (quick, efficient weights; deweighting step back; muscle elastic recoil effect; deweighting crossover)

\- 5:11 Composure (staying calm, stress neuroscience)

For those at work or the hard of hearing, I've transcribed subtitles on YouTube so sound isn't required.

Summary (will do my best without visuals): Kyrie has an incredible ability to stop quickly and then change direction. An underlying foundation of that ability is what I call ""mental speed"" in which he's able to read what's in front of him really quickly and then translate that into action (the video has a clip of him vs Gobert). Further, Kyrie always attacks from a balanced platform with his feet giving him a wide base of support which allows him to not only stay balanced but also absorb/deliver contact to other players. That balance combined with elite full body coordination is what makes him so effective at getting in and out of breaks (the video has a clip of him vs Westbrook). Moving on, Kyrie plays extremely low to the ground which lowers his center of gravity, improving his balance and change of direction ability. He's able to maintain that low center of mass throughout his change of direction movements (video has a clip vs Jae Crowder). From a physical mechanics perspective, Kyrie has an incredible ability - similar to Kemba Walker - to nearly completely deweight one leg, load the other, and then spring into change of direction (""elastic recoil"" of muscles). Key examples are on his step back and crossover (clip in the video is vs Avery Bradley). Last but not least, Kyrie never panics regardless of which situation he's in and that allows him to continue to use all of the aforementioned principles. Neuroscience research indicates that when you're overly stressed, it interferes with high level decision making by inhibiting the prefrontal cortex (the clip in the video is vs Malcolm Brogdon).

When most fans think of the Bucks, what comes to mind is most likely Giannis leading an unstoppable fastbreak on an open floor spread out by shooters, with Khris serving as an excellent 2nd option, and that this has been the crux of their historic regular season, with the Bucks on pace for 70 wins before the stoppage.

However, their offense has simply been very good, not all-time great - they're 7th in the league in ORTG (112.6 offensive rating), with a relative ORTG of +2.2 (compared to league average offense). 

It's their world-beating ***defense*** that has been the main engine of their success. They rank 1st in DRTG (101.9), which is a whopping **+3.3 points better than the 2nd ranked Raptors**, who are having an awesome defensive season themselves, with a relative DRTG comparable to last season's top-ranked Bucks defense, and is a ridiculous **+8.5 points better than the league average defense.**

[538.com had an excellent article on the Bucks' historic defense](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/few-teams-have-ever-defended-like-these-milwaukee-bucks/), and I've quoted some relevant portions below (but the whole article is great, go give it a read!):

&gt; By allowing just 102.0 points per 100 possessions (per Basketball-Reference), the Bucks’ defense is not only the best in the NBA right now, but also one of the best ever. That defensive rating is 8.2 points per 100 better than the average NBA defense this season — which gives Milwaukee the NBA’s best defense since the 2008 Boston Celtics, and the eighth-best unit in history.

&gt; The Bucks have become a historically dominant defense despite largely ignoring a couple of rules that were once thought to be vitally important. 

&gt; For starters, they play at the NBA’s fastest pace, a trait we don’t really think of when we picture a great defensive team grinding out wins in the postseason. Even more surprising: Milwaukee has managed to lock down opposing offenses despite surrendering one of the largest shares of 3-point tries of any club, something once thought to be a no-no from an analytics standpoint.


&gt; The Bucks’ decision to play so far off the 3-point line — normally done by keeping center Brook Lopez firmly in the paint, even in pick-and-pop scenarios — is rooted in the makeup of their roster: long-limbed players and great rim protectors.

&gt; Sometimes the Bucks all but roll out a red carpet to the rim, as they surrender more drives per 100 possessions than any other club, according to Second Spectrum. That, too, is by design: Milwaukee holds shooters to a field goal percentage of just under 60 percent from inside of 3 feet, the league’s best mark. One stat that highlights how insanely good the team has been along the back line? Of the NBA’s league’s four best stoppers at the rim, in terms of defensive field-goal differential, three — Antetokounmpo, Lopez, and Lopez’s brother, Robin — just happen to suit up for the Bucks. Opponents shoot 19 percentage points below their average at the rim when Giannis is closest to the play. They’re 17.5 points worse when Brook Lopez is nearby; 14.6 points worse when it’s Robin Lopez.

&gt; Opposing players often see daylight ahead of them because of the seemingly advantageous angles the Bucks’ wings give them. (They even dare to give ample driving space to James Harden, albeit in an attempt to bait him into going to his off-hand side.) But the defenders, Eric Bledsoe and Donte DiVincenzo in particular, have become skilled at “rear-view contests,” sometimes erasing shots before they can leave the shooter’s hand. The Bucks’ guards have a league-high 48 rejections on jumpers and floaters.

&gt; Even when teams do manage to get shots off against Milwaukee, there’s usually no such thing as a second chance, as the Bucks own an NBA-high defensive rebound rate of 77.1 percent.",False,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,82518,public,self,The 2019-20 Bucks have been one of the best defensive teams of the past 40 years,0,[],,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/g2w1i7/the_201920_bucks_have_been_one_of_the_best/,some_ads,7,112a98bc-8b9a-11e8-9ae9-0e6672d65b8e,Team Discussion,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '-gA4li819aA7KkDqh-pYk9zKB4K0QQ9rc46wqEQpY3U', 'resolutions': [{'height': 100, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/s1N8k8Fa8Jn7hCyoYheVkDpqaCdGEg9ZWPp3WPid590.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e56047b05037c1d4e88435648e2ef30ff304c300', 'width': 108}, {'height': 201, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/s1N8k8Fa8Jn7hCyoYheVkDpqaCdGEg9ZWPp3WPid590.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c83e3d0b08b031290ab6cde3565191a5f372753', 'width': 216}, {'height': 298, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/s1N8k8Fa8Jn7hCyoYheVkDpqaCdGEg9ZWPp3WPid590.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ef0c13dba2036187b11942f6564f9e617c9bb8e', 'width': 320}, {'height': 596, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/s1N8k8Fa8Jn7hCyoYheVkDpqaCdGEg9ZWPp3WPid590.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ed76a9d30829ffb104fc2bfcef3e431321223d6', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 649, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/s1N8k8Fa8Jn7hCyoYheVkDpqaCdGEg9ZWPp3WPid590.png?auto=webp&amp;s=100d554db47646200a6ab0b4d82db936dd69d797', 'width': 696}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,

Essentially, this was a qualitative exercise that divided players into four broad categories (lead guards, wings, fours, and fives) and then into further sub-categories (i.e. the archetypes). Personally, this makes it much easier to envision what roles potential NBA players (be they draft prospects, G-League players, end-of-bench hopefuls, or whoever) will plausibly be able to fill, and the relative value of that role. 

Having a broader context around a player's skills and weaknesses is helpful to understanding how those skills/weaknesses might end up being applied in NBA action. 

Unfortunately, Cole has long since abandoned his website, and, as far as I know, that’s the only place where they were documented. However, through the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20170708213004/https://capstrategist.com/), I was able to find the Broad Categories and Archetypes—but no more. So, since the NBA is suspended until further notice, from memory and with some adjustments, I tried to flesh out his archetypes. Here’s what I came up with for Lead Guards:

***

**Lead Guards**
--

This first category would mostly be comprised of traditional point guards. Sub-categories are:

**Two-Way Scheme Changers:** These are lead guards who are so dynamic on offense due to a combo of shooting, skill, and/or athleticism that they push defenses to their breaking points. Also, they are effective on defense. One of the most valuable archetypes. 

*Examples:* Steph Curry and Chris Paul (prime) are the two best examples I can think of for this archetype. Some may quibble about Steph's defense, but I think he is (or at least used to be), effective there.

**Offensive Scheme Changers:** Same as the above category, but they aren’t effective on defense. Also one of the most valuable archetypes, in spite of defensive shortcomings. 

*Examples:* James Harden is probably the clearest example. I'd also throw in Damian Lillard. Kyrie Irving too, maybe. Trae Young also belongs, or will belong here quite soon.

**Outlier Athleticism/Tools:** These are lead guards who may not possess the same combo of shooting + skill as the above two categories (which isn’t to say they don’t possess shooting or skill), but compensate with athleticism and physical tools. Also a very valuable archetype, but relatively rare and perhaps more susceptible to aging/injuries. 

*Examples:* Russell Westbrook, John Wall, Derrick Rose (pre-injuries)

**Two-Way Primary Initiators/Scorers:** These are lead guards who don’t quite have the same scheme-breaking/defensive-bending abilities as the Offensive Scheme Changers or the physical abilities as Outlier Athleticism + Tools, but they are nonetheless capable of being the primary initiators or scorers on effective offenses. Also, they are effective on defense. A very valuable archetype. While they mostly likely aren’t going to be the driver of a championship level team, they can drive a playoff-level one and scale well with superior talent. 

*Examples:* Mike Conley is perhaps the prototype here (at least before this year). Kyle Lowry too, I think. Malcolm Brogdon is also someone I would throw in here. Eric Bledsoe as well, though his 3-ball can be shaky as we've seen in the playoffs. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander also made his way in here this year imo, which is impressive. Jrue Holiday.

**One-Way Primary Initiators/Scorers:** Same as the above category, but they aren’t effective on defense. Also a valuable archetype, as they can drive playoff-level teams. However, there are questions about their abilities to scale well with superior talent. 

*Examples:* Kemba Walker, D’Angelo Russell. Kemba has actually scaled pretty well this year on the Celtics and been solid on defense, so maybe he longer really fits here. But in his Charlotte years I think he fit really well. 

**Dribble-Drivers:** This category comprises lead guards who aren’t up to the task of the above two-categories, but they are nonetheless still capable of being full-time ball-handlers—just they most likely will not be the driving force behind a successful offense. Most back-up PG types probably fall under this. Admittedly, I’m not sure about this category. I feel like the name is more reflective of a play-style than actual ability, which seems to be the more important criterion here. Do you guys have a better idea for this category?

*Examples:* Former ATL teammates Jeff Teague and Dennis Schroeder are the clearest examples I think. But I can't think of many beyond that tbh. Maybe Spencer Dinwiddie. DJ Augustine? 

**Defensive Tools + Non-Shooters:** Non-shooting lead guards who have strong physical tools, but not to the level of the Outlier Athleticism + Tools archetype. Every now and then, a few of these kinds of players gain some traction/interest, but overall are not very valuable. 

*Examples:* Kris Dunn, Michael Carter-Williams, Frank Ntilikina, Markelle Fultz (post shooting weirdness)

**3&amp;D + Initiation:** These are mostly off-ball types, but they can bring the ball up and initiate some sets. They also are capable spot-up 3-point shooters and effective defenders. Will not drive a playoff-level team, but are valuable due to their ability to scale well with superior players. 

*Examples:* Patrick Beverley is the prototype. George Hill as well I guess. Not super common, though. Matthew Dellavedova kind of operated in this role for the Cavs, but he wasn't all that good. Edit: Lonzo Ball as well

***

What do you guys think? Any improvements to the categories or examples? I'd be curious in seeing of more player examples, if you guys have any thoughts on that.

I find this very helpful as a framework for thinking about the draft. For example, Killian Hayes is someone who I feel better about having as the top prospect this year.

Edit: there are no cons to this? Everyone is just arguing against my points...

It seems that a lot of people have been saying the NCAA is screwed and the G-league offer is competitive... Aside from the NBA going back to a HS-graduate eligible draft in a few years, I wanted a play a little devil's advocate to the cons of skipping college for g-league (keep in mind this is only applicable to a top tier prospect):

- **Miss out on the college experience, and work immediately with pros** - It's pretty well known that there are plenty of journeymen that use the G-league to get back into the league. They might harbor some sort of resentment to have a younger stud taking their playing time and this could lead to poor development and chemistry issues. In college, the new recruit likely comes in as top dog and his teammates automatically respect that (and some even signed on because of said top prospect). Look back at when the NBA had high schoolers in their drafts, the great ones were truly transcendental (Kobe, KG, Tmac) but other likes Darius Miles, Jonathan Bender, etc., didn't exactly pan out. 

- **College campus versus fly over cities** - No disrespect to the G-league cities, but they're generally smaller and secondary to the larger markets they are tied to. While college campuses reside on mostly smaller cities, they are at least the main source of attraction there and they would be filled with individuals of similar age.

- **A legacy in college is better than one in the G-league** - Look at Carmelo's legacy at 'Cuse. He brought them to the chip in his one year and he will forever be revered on campus. If you take a G-league team to the championship, that's probably not going on your HoF resume (assuming the coach isn't cutting your minutes because they're saving you for the main league). Look at MLB for example, very few people talk about minor league championships.

- **Probably gets paid in college plus scholarship is available down the road** - First, the prospect probably get similar pay from college boosters. Second, it seems that you can always go back to your alma mater once your playing career ends, e.g. Shaq graduating from LSU in 2000. Also, while the G-league is giving out college scholarships, the prospect might not be able to choose where he goes for school. Let's say the prospect flames out of the league, he is a millionaire but that's probably not enough money to ""donate"" and enroll in any school they wanted. The top prospect could be missing out on a great education from Duke, Virginia or Michigan or any of the top tier scholastic/athletic schools.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,82502,public,self,[Discussion] Jalen Green going to the G-league versus College,0,[],,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/g2ofk5/discussion_jalen_green_going_to_the_gleague/,some_ads,7,ae62087a-f8c0-11e8-a415-0e9f206e00fa,Current Events,,,,,,,,1587096350.0,

Jordan famously won DPOY, the Scoring Title, and MVP in 1988, leading the bulls to 50 wins before losing 5-1 to the Pistons(the best defense in the league) in the second round.

Lebron finished second in DPOY voting and won MVP in 2009, leading the cavs to 66 wins before losing 4-2 to the Magic(also the best defense in the league) in the conference finals.

**REGULAR SEASON**

The 09 cavs, without lebron, had the worst point differential in the league. With Lebron they posted the 6th best srs ever and won 66 games. The 88 Bulls, without Jordan, were also one of the worst teams in the league, but posted a strong +3.2 SRS with him playing at a 52 win pace.

Instead he went to the Cavs, where he got his ring, but his reputation and mental health suffered on the way. Makes me think what would be better for guys like him. Obviously ring is the ultimate goal, but the pressure of doing it alongside the King, is huge and it left its mark.

What do you guys think? From perspective of Kevin Love's of this world, should he done what he did? There was no guarantee he'd have won, in which case his reputation would take even bigger hit.

It's a list of the roster you could assemble of your team who were relatively poorly utilized, but could have realistically worked out better with  if things had just been slightly different. They HAVE to have been on your team, so no Blazers Draft Michael Jordan hypotheticals. This also based on decisions, so no ""what if he doesn't get injured"" inclusions. 

I'll start with **Portland**. 

**PG: Greg Anthony.** I still feel like the biggest mistake Dunleavy and Whitsitt made was to put the keys in the hands of Damon Stoudamire. With so much creativity and talent on our roster, we didn't need a ball dominant, undersized, poor defense point guard. Anthony provided defense and shooting and let others do the hard work. He was our Derek Fisher, and we never used him as much as we could have. Every team we faced exploited the Mouse. I don't think he'd have had phenomenal stats, but we would have been a much better team with him getting starters minutes and Stoudamire scoring off the bench.

**SG: Brandon Roy.** His knees only had so many miles on them. We knew that when we drafted him, and it's why he was available. I think there's a scenario where you play him more like Ginobili around 27mpg instead of 37mpg. You probably trade in three All Star appearances for maybe 3 or 4 more good seasons of play. Make him play some SF. Watching him, Dame and LMA go to work in Dame's early years would've been a lot of fun. I don't know--maybe you just can't do that to an NBA star without him losing his mind. But in my sliding doors reality it works.

**SF: Drazen Petrovic:** He was technically a SG, but I couldn't leave him off. A year after leaving us he's putting up 22ppg on 58%TS. Ugh. If he hadn't died in a freakish car crash, he'd have been the OG Jermaine O'Neal. Which brings us to.....

**PF: Jermaine O'Neal.** Oh man did we fuck this up. While we were dicking around with Detlef Shrempf and Shawn Kemp, we had a six time All Star sitting on the far end of the bench. He is the reason no Blazer 22 or under will ever be traded again. ""We can't trade Ruben Boumtje-Boumtje. What if he's the next Jermaine O'Neal?!?!""

**C: Bill Walton.** This was before my time. After the injury, he was never going to be THE Bill Walton again. But looking back I wish he'd spent his career in Portland. He loved the city, he's a fantastic personality, and I just think he'd have been a great bench center and locker room influence. I don't know the particulars on why he left, but it seems a real shame. He seems like a Dirk Nowitzki sort of presence that you just want to see retire with your team.

Bench:
**Scottie Pippen** This kind of ties into Greg Anthony, but I'd just like to highlight a single stat:
Last year in Chicago: 24.4% USG Result: NBA Championship
One year in Houston: 19.7% USG Result: Complete team meltdown
So what do we do when we get Scottie? Let's do EXACTLY what Houston did, and let him touch the ball 19.6% of the time.

Sherwood-Strauss is an ex ESPN warriors beat writer for the Athletic. He's very smart, very funny, eloquent on podcasts and has a writing style far more interesting and elegant than is common among beat writers. 

He became somewhat famous when KD openly beefed with him last year, when he wrote a piece about how it was an open secret around the Warriors that KD was leaving. 

This book is about the rise and fall of the Warriors dynasty. I'm going to admit that I skipped to the KD chapter--I will read the rest of this book this week, but I sorely needed the juicy details during this boring lockdown. 

I don't want to quote at length because this is a new book and we should support our favorite writers financially. But there is an INSANE amount of background detail and direct quotes from the Warriors mid-breakdown here, including KD rabidly complaining about how Steph gets all the love from Warriors fans. It goes farther than that, even--KD gets pissed when the Warriors fans cheer for Maurice Speights. He tells Speights that his nickname shouldn't be Mo Buckets because he only averages 12 a game. Another detail is KD starting a fight with a different Warriors beat reporter because of what he heard the reporter say 45 minutes into a local low-listenership podcast. According to thsi reporter, KD said he should know that he reads and listens to *everything.*

Just curious about everyone's thoughts on this draft overall and individual prospects?

A couple of thoughts I've had.

1. Onyeka Okongwu looks like he could develop into the best player in the draft. Needs to develop a reliable jumper and have more discipline on defense though.

2. Nico Mannion is an intriguing prospect who projects at 25 here but earlier in the year I had seen him top 10 or even top 5 on some boards. The NCAA tournament would have been a good opportunity for him to put himself back in the lottery.

3. James Wiseman needs the right team to pick him. He is going to need time to develop but can immediately be used for his athleticism and rim protection. The Golden State Warriors would be a perfect fit for him I feel like.

4. Anthony Edwards is the prospect that I personally like the most but there are some concerns with his effort and jumpshot. His ability to get to the rim and finish in transition are at an NBA level and he has the body to match.

5. Tyrese Haliburton may be able to run an offense right away. He has a great feel for the game and could be a rookie of the year candidate. 

6. Deni Avdija is one player I really know nothing about and their doesn't seem to be any consensus about him. Really curious what you guys think of him. 

7. Tyrell Terry is very undersized at 6' 2"" 160 lb but he can shoot. He may be your next favorite player. 

8. Jaden McDaniels may be the prospect who's stock took the biggest hit this year after a disappointing season at Washington. Even then, just his ball handling and shooting at his size is enough to think he has enormous potential in the league. 

9. Tyler Bey is an undersized big man with a decent stroke who is projected late first round. His defense is his biggest strength and will be able to contribute right away. 

10. Killian Hayes who came in at number 1 in this big board surprised me also Wiseman being down at number 7.

This draft seems weak overall but still has a few potential stars. I know getting drafted into the right system and by the right team is a huge determining factor on whether or not a player succeeds in the league in every draft, but this year that factor seems more pronounced with these prospects. Looks like lots of role players who will need a team to find the right way to utilize their skills.

Trivia: last season's Harden (36.1 ppg, 48.2 pp100) set the highest scoring rate in NBA history. 

- - Despite LeBron and AD having a similar usage and scoring rate, the Lakers net rating *improves* by +10.8 points when LeBron was on the floor, but *dropped* by 2.7 for when AD was playing. This aberration is likely because Dwight and McGee were more than capable of beating up on weaker bench units when AD left for the bench (similar to how even MVP-candidate Harden had slightly underwhelming on/off figures because those CP-led bench units roasted teams while he was sitting). Moving LeBron to the bench, however, is a disaster, because the Lakers' next most reliable playmaker is Rajon Rondo, who has a glorious on/off split of -8.3. LeBron lifts a heavier load for this team than is immediately apparent to the eye.


- - Hassan Whiteside leads the league with 3.1 blocks per game. The Blazers are 27th in defensive rating. 

- - The value of spacing. Capela-era Russell Westbrook: 26.4 ppg on 52.4 TS% ;  Post-Capela Russell Westbrook: 31.7 ppg on 59.3 TS%. Shoutout to James Harden, who will pretty much keep getting his regardless of who's around him - Clint-era: 35.8 ppg on 61.8 TS%, post-Clint - 29.4 ppg on 60.7 TS%.

- - The 2019-20 Dallas Mavericks set the highest single-season offensive rating in NBA history: 116.7. The gap between them and the 2nd-place Houston Rockets (113.8) is similar to the gap between the Rockets and the 15th-place Pelicans (110.8). They're ***6.3*** points better than the league average offense. [538 did an excellent piece on them](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/luka-doncic-and-the-mavs-are-pushing-the-limits-of-offensive-efficiency/).

- - The 2019-20 Milwaukee have been similarly destructive on *defense*, if not even more so. They're in a class of their own, a whopping ***3.3*** points better defensively than the 2nd-ranked Raptors. They're also a ridiculous ***8.5 points better*** than the league average defense. And, yes, you guessed it, [538 did an excellent piece on them as well](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/few-teams-have-ever-defended-like-these-milwaukee-bucks/).

- - Russell Westbrook leads the league in 2 point field goal attempts, and James Harden leads the league in 3 points field goal attempts.

- - It probably began with Westbrook's historic MVP season or one of those Cleveland LeBron years, but we are now officially well and truly in the era of **heliocentric superstars**: 
 in the 2019-20 season, there are **6 players with usage rates over 34%** - Giannis, Luka, Harden, Trae, Beal, and Westbrook. (Heck, Harden and Westbrook *play for the same team*. Bonkers.) In the 2015-16 season, there was only 1 player **total** with a usage rate above 34% - DeMarcus Cousins, with 35.4 %. More players have begun adopting the Harden/WB/LeBron do-absolutely-everything-for-your-offense approach this season, and *very very soon* it could be the norm, rather than the exception.

- - Khris Middleton is *painfully, achingly* close to a 50/40/90 season, with .499/.418/.908 splits. :'(

- - For the 1st time in 4 years, James Harden isn't leading the league in offensive win-shares: that award goes to Damian Lillard, who edges out Harden while trying to drag the skeleton Blazers kicking and screaming into the playoffs, putting up 8.9 win-shares as a result (to Harden's 8.7).

- -  Devin Booker (72.3%) and Luka Doncic (75.4%) have had *phenomenal* paint-finishing seasons. Booker's finishing at the rim for a guard has been fantastic, and Luka has been putting up efficiency in the paint comparable to historically elite finishers like Anthony Davis (75.3%) and Giannis (76.7%). Of course, those guys *take* more shots in the paint than these two, but the efficiency is still highly remarkable.


- - LeBron James is primed to be the 6th player in NBA history with both a scoring title and assist title to their name (the others being Tiny Archibald, Jerry West, Oscar Robertson, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden). Speaking of Harden, he is primed to be the 9th player in NBA history to win 3 scoring titles. Giannis is primed to be the 14th player in NBA history to win 2 MVPs.

- - Giannis Antetokounmpo's 31.71 PER this season is set to be the 5th highest mark in NBA history, only behind MJ, LeBron, and 2 Wilt seasons, and by the tiniest of margins (Wilt's no. 1 ranked PER ever was around 31.8).


- - This will likely be LeBron's 13th All-NBA 1st-team, the highest ever, ahead of Kobe and Karl Malone with 11. This will also put LeBron at 16 total All-NBA selections, breaking a tie between him, Kareem, Kobe, and Duncan and vaulting him into clear 1st place.

- - Now, nearly 5 years after one man weaponised the 3 point shot like no other, how far are the rest of the league from catching Steph's ridiculous 2015-16 record of 402 threes made in a single season? That season, he played 80 games, made 5.1 threes per game, attempted 11.2 threes per game, and shot 45.5 3P%. The most productive high-volume shooters this season (&gt;3.5 3PM/game) have been: Harden (4.4 3PM/game, 12.6 3PA, 35.2 3P%), Lillard (3.9 3PM, 9.9 3PA, 39.4 3P%), Buddy Hield (3.8 3PM, 9.7 3PA, 39.5 3P%), Duncan Robinson (3.7 3PM, 8.4 3PA, 44.8 3P%), and Davis Bertans (3.7 3PM, 8.7 3PA, 42.4 3P%). As I'm sure you've all realised by now, it's *extremely* difficult to maintain such an obscenely good 3P% (45.5, wtf) while shooting over 11 3s a game. Even extremely good shooters like Hield and Bertans have found that pushing the upper limit of attempts has limited their efficiency somewhat (down from 44-45%), and neither of them even cracked double-digit 3P attempts. The solution to this, other than pulling a Steph, seems to be simply *taking* more 3s. The only players with the combination of **usage**, 3p-shooting prowess, 3p-attempting likelihood, and durability, seem to be Harden, Lillard, Trae, Luka, and maybe D'Angelo Russell or Devonte' Graham. 

Some special performances: 

- - Harden joined Klay Thompson and Kobe Bryant as the only players to score 60 points in 3 quarters, with his 4th career 60 point game against the Atlanta Hawks on Nov. 30.  He produced 60/3/8 on 88 TS%. [highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKMtbkzqHq0)

- - Kyrie Irving, on 31st Jan 2020 against the Bulls, had the most efficient 50 point game in NBA history, scoring 54 points on 98.5 TS% (97.8 eFG%): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEGnC71uW8U


- - Luka Doncic had the fastest 30-point triple double since the NBA-ABA merger, in his 35/10/11 outing against the Warriors in 26 minutes on Nov. 20. [highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR1V37ODaNs)

- - Zach Lavine's Nov 23 performance against the Hornets was one for the ages. On the surface, the 49 points and 13 3-pointers (2nd most of all time) are impressive enough, but context makes it even more special: the Bulls were **trailing by 8 with 45 seconds remaining**, with the game basically out of reach, before Lavine hit three of his 3s, including [this completely ridiculous relocation-to-the-wing-three off an inbounds-steal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW74Oj2G8H4) as a completely improbable game-winner to cap off an incredible night. [The whole final minute is a must-watch, if you haven't already.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJ9pnTcGwxs)

Its easy to name the players above because anyone on that level must have a high BBIQ. But aside from them who would you consider to have some of the highest BBIQ in the game? 

Its very subjective and there are a lot of variables to take into account, depending on your own definition. 

For me personally I consider defence and passing as the key variables for determining BBIQ at a high level.
