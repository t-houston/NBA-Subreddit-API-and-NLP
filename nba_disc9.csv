Their regular season record, despite very little chemistry, and the third major roster change for Philly, still resulted in an 8-2 record, including signature regular season wins against Boston and Milwaukee. Extrapolated over a whole season, this would put them with a 66-16 finish, 6 games ahead of the regular season-leading Bucks, who finished 60-22.

The Sixers playoff record was 7-5, with Philly going 6-5 in the games played by their starting 5. However, Embiid was sick in a few of the games, and with them being played against the same opponents, and playoff ones at that, the sample size is a bit skewed. So overall, Phildelphia went 14-7 with their starting 5 playing all together, extrapolated to 55-27, 4th-best overall. And, once again, it must be taken into consideration that the starters only played 21 games together out of the overall 94 games this season, and would only get better with a whole offseason, training camp, and preseason to improve their regular season record and overall playoff finish. I could truly see them finishing with the no. 1 seed next season.

With all this being said, I think that Philly has what it takes to beat the Golden State Warriors. Take into consideration that fact that Philly beat them at Oracle before the Harris trade occurred, and only lost by 3 in Philly after the Harris trade because Embiid at out. With a whole season together, the Sixers size, and Embiid's dominance in the middle, even against DeMarcus Cousins in the Sixers win, they have all that it takes. This is the case especially when taking into consideration the Sixers ECSF series against Toronto, this season's Eastern Conference Champions where Embiid was sick, Simmons was mostly mitigated, and Harris was missing his wide-open looks. So there should be no reason they Philadelphia shouldn't bring back their core for this season and beyond.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,38360,public,self,"In the regular season, the 76ers went 8-2 with their Phantastic Phive lineup.

But I am disappointed in the Bucks offense these last two games. 

A few things I noted:
1) Bucks let Giannis be on the three point line pretty much as a spot up shooter ( which he is clearly not) on the wings a lot. This led to the guards either trying to ISO on their bigs. Milwaukee were not equipped to expose Them due to the inconsistent outside shooting causing them to drive into the long defender of Toronto, and kicking out to Giannis. Giannis would always catch with daylight but he's not a shooter so the possessions would devolve into a Giannis drive and a tough contested shot in the lane or a lofty kick out with the shot clock running down. 

2) The Bucks didn't effectively know how to get out of the doubles thrown at Giannis that came from Toronto. Whenever he would be doubled trying to back someone down, he would dribble out to the perimeter to try to lose the help defender and then look for the pass, but this also gave the defenders of Toronto the advantage since the floor shrunk from Giannis going to the three point line making it easier to recover to shooters when Giannis found them. 

3) I guess this is a continuation of the last one, why didn't they try to get Giannis down on the block when they would switch. There were many opportunities for Giannis to make himself big on the block but he would clear the other side to Le a guard ISO. Yeah Giannis would be doubled, but that was happening anyways and a double from deep in the paint would leave a lot more ground for the help defender to cover. It would also allow Giannis to get a move off quick if the defender is leveraged enough.

NOW BACK TO OUR SCHEDULED PROGRAMMING:
______

During my 15 years of coaching ball, I've done a *lot* of probably *way* too in-depth studying of how to build the most efficient, simple, and fluid jumper. This eventually led me to develop the curriculum for, and coach, my own 4 day 'Shooting' and 'Advanced Shooting' camps where a jumper is broken down to:

**Day 1** lower body  
**Day 2** upper body pre- and during-shot  
**Day 3** upper body during- and post-release of shot  
**Day 4** everything previously learned put into the overall package of a jumpshot

Okay okay okay.

So, like the building of any great structure (jumpshot), we'll start with a balanced and sturdy foundation (the lower body) and work our way up... We'll break down Kawhi's jumper from his SDSU days and compare it, briefly, to how he shoots meow.
______

**Lower Body**

*SEE BELOW: ""Supplemental Shooting Clips from Leonard's SDSU Days"" &amp; ""Kawhi's NBA Shooting Form"" video*

*Lower Body:* **Good Things**

* I see Kawhi's lower body action pre-, during-, and post-shot as quite consistent and close to the ideal of what you would want: gathers quickly in hip-width stance on balls of feet with bouncy knees for best explosiveness/power. Compared to the latest software Kawhi is using, lower body of SDSU.Kawhi looking so similar. SEE specifically-chosen sideview clips below of Kawhi shooting from his SDSU days and compare to short video of Kawhi shooting during NBA tenure.

* The previous point also illustrates the amount of elevation Kawhi got, and still gets, on his jumper. This is YUGE. Elevating not only literally allows you to be higher above the defender's outstretched contesting hand, but it also means you're *potentially* getting quite a bit of power transference from your muscular and springy legs to shooting the ball up and out to the hoop

* **DON'T FORGET**: The power for shooting the ball *should* come from you lower body and shooting on the way up (a la Wardell Stephen ""Steph"" Curry II), NOT from your upper body.

*Lower Body:* **Things That Needed Improvement**

* *HOWEVER*, if I could draw your attention to how Kawhi shot, in his SDSU days, in regards to *when* he released/shot the ball... HE DOES IT WHEN HE IS ALREADY ON THE WAY DOWN! It's subtle, but in practically all 16 of the gathered clips, Kawhi shoots once he is already descending back to Earth. This will be important to remember for when I touch on his '**Upper Body**' technique below.

**Upper Body**

*SEE BELOW: ""Supplemental Shooting Clips from Leonard's SDSU Days"" &amp; ""Kawhi's NBA Shooting Form"" video*

*Upper Body:* **Good Things**

* Kawhi, as can be seen best in sideview clips *[3](https://youtu.be/7hfPwLxrvYM?t=76), [6](https://youtu.be/7hfPwLxrvYM?t=149), [8](https://youtu.be/7hfPwLxrvYM?t=177), [9](https://youtu.be/7hfPwLxrvYM?t=207), and [12](https://youtu.be/7hfPwLxrvYM?t=244)*, got the ball to high-release points. This was, and still is, a *great* part of Kawhi's jumpshot as coupled with his height and length, practically NOBODY is blocking his jumper  

* As can also be seen in those sideview clips, Kawhi was quite, and still is, quick in getting the ball up to his higher-than-most-defender's-contest-hand shooting pocket. This was/is great: if you you are slow on getting the ball up to shoot:  

1. D has more time to react to you shooting, thus meaning you're probably getting your shit sent PACKING more often than you'd like.  
2. As long as you're a solid shooter who is able to quickly and efficiently get ready to shoot, the D HAS TO respect you. This means they'll be cheating more towards you, opening up lanes for other players.  
3. This will also open up better driving oppos for you! If your defender has to respect your jumper because you hit shots at a good clip *coupled* with the fact that you are able to get into shooting your shot on a moment's notice... then they HAVE TO play tight on you. Playing tight on you is actually what you want, because if someone is playing really tightly on you, theoretically it will be easier to drive through either of their hips/thighs to attack the rim. Now you're driving by them... they can't guard your move (making jumpers) and your counter-move (driving by them) at the same time. They have to pick their proverbial poison! And **THIS** right here is why so many greats ([Shaq included!](https://youtu.be/BcJwYoDy54I?t=171) And [Kobe too!](https://youtu.be/C_ipDVdrUt0?t=288)) talk about having one great move, then having one great counter-move. NO ONE SINGLE PLAYER WILL BE ABLE TO STOP BOTH AS LONG AS THE MOVES ARE TRUE COUNTERS OF EACH OTHER. It's *physically impossible*.  
4. Being able to quickly get the ball into shooting pocket to shoot also makes you a more deadly off-the-bounce (dribble pull-ups) shooter. Yet another thing the D has to consider when guarding you. So even when you put the ball down, they can't sag off and think, ""Phew, he won't be pulling up quickly as long as he is dribbling, so I can just chill back a bit and guard the drive..."" At this point, I hope you're understanding how the D is fuct if you have these traits.

*Upper Body:* **Things That Needed Improvement**

*This* is where one can really see how new programmers are far superior to the older programmers that worked on SDSU.Kawhi:

* As is best seen in profile angles of Leonard's jumper from *[clips 3](https://youtu.be/7hfPwLxrvYM?t=76), [6](https://youtu.be/7hfPwLxrvYM?t=149), [8](https://youtu.be/7hfPwLxrvYM?t=177), [9](https://youtu.be/7hfPwLxrvYM?t=207), and [12](https://youtu.be/7hfPwLxrvYM?t=244)*, Leonard used to 'sling' the ball well above and behind the front vertical plane (his face!) of his head before shooting. Doing this caused his upper body to slingshot the ball instead of purely shooting it.  

* This caused it to look as if Kawhi was throwing his butt slightly backwards when shooting, AND HE WAS. But in reality, this was happening *because* he was slinging his body forward to 'shoot' the ball at the rim; instead, one wants to shoot the ball *up* and *out* (not *forward* and *at*). It's also especially important that the rest of you body isn't wildly moving in any direction besides up in one smooth motion. As you can see from SDSU.Kawhi shooting clips, this was not the case.  

* Obviously, you don't want any extraneous movement of your body as this will throw off the trajectory of your shot; if your body is moving in a funky way, it's also harder to consistently reproduce your shot form, which is a HUGE component of great shooters: consistent form; and, if your body is moving in a funky way, instead of smoothly up in one motion, when shooting you'll naturally compensate in other areas of your physical shooting form, which will *only* cause more issues with the way you shoot the ball -- compensating in one area of life takes resources away from other areas.  

* *addendum to previous point*: to this day, you can see that Kawhi's shot doesn't have a ton of arc to it. Probably a remnant of the slingshot method he used to employ.  

* I believe Kawhi was using this slingshot technique because he was shooting on the way down -- SEE above explanation of this in the last main bullet point of '**Lower Body**'. SDSU.Kawhi had exactly NONE of that sweet, sweet elastic energy from his bouncy legs transfer to his shot... it's sad when I see this happen with players. You may as well not be jumping! I mean...besides to elevate above the D's hands of course.  

* Since SDSU.Kawhi was shooting on the way down, this could explain why he adopted a slingshot technique. The actual power for shooting the ball had to come from somewhere! Trebuchets and slingshots were hella *powerful* weapons in their days.  

* However, this is a chicken-egg type scenario... did SDSU.Kawhi slingshot because he was shooting on the way down and needed that power to get the ball to the hoop OR did SDSU.Kawhi shoot on the way down because he didn't need the power from his legs due to his *powerful* slingshot way of shooting?  

Finally, aspiring coaches and players, remember this if nothing else!  

* The upper body technique is what smoothly guides the ball to the centre of the hoop, whereas *power* for getting the ball to the hoop comes from the lower body in conjunction with timing your shooting release point.  
*Especially* work on using the strength of the lower body during shooting, not after you've already shot: while on your way up is the optimal time to shoot the ball as the momentum/kinetic energy from your extending lower body will fully transfer to the ball. Think about loading a spring then letting it go! That bouncy/elastic energy is what you get from properly executed lower body shooting technique. If you combine that with good upper body technique and releasing your shot on the way up, you'll then be most-efficiently transferring the energy from your legs into getting the ball to the rim.

__________

In summary, and to tie everything into the present day, I believe Chip Engelland (legendary Spurs shooting coach) and Kawhi (and whoever else helped him smooth out his jumper) eliminated his slingshot by moving where his shooting pocket and point of release was/is to somewhere more above his shooting eyebrow, rather than in the middle-back of his head. In addition, I think they smoothed out that hitch SDSU.Kawhi had where he would shoot on the way down, thus having no power in his jumper.

In my mind, his potential caps off right before we start talking about the greats such as LeBron, Kawhi, Jordan, KD, simply due to his lack of the offensive versatility beyond double clutching over everyone for a layup.

I could see him become a Giannis type player in that his athletic build and strength already boosts his game to another level. He still is limited in the true height category though, which could affect him inside. Also, although his jumpshot looked improved at Duke, his shooting development is yet to be seen which could be a huge factor in his success. Either by restricting his potential and limiting his offense to the inside or opening up his game to so many more opportunities(pullup and spot up threes) keeping the defense honest.

Overall, he has shown that his decision making as not just a scorer but a passer is pretty remarkable, and his ability to take over a game has been seen in the NCAA tourney. Combine those attributes with his youth/potential to grow and he could easily become a more confined and athletic form of Giannis Antetokounmpo.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,37917,public,self,What is Zion Williamson's ceiling in the NBA?,0,1559619629,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/bssbs8/what_is_zion_williamsons_ceiling_in_the_nba/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Once considered a top 10 near consensus highschool prospect (ESPN 5, Rivals 11, 247 9), the 6\'11"" power forward out of Wisconsin failed to live up to his expectations as a modern day, pace and space player with shooting chops ... in his time as a Piston.

The lifetime negative win share player seen on the Pistons was nowhere to be found, and in its stead appeared a new, analytically driven Henry Ellenson, who at only 22 years old, may need another look as a prospect.  Take a peek at the table below:\n\n\n\n|Stat|GP|MP|3PA|3P%|FGA|FG%|eFG%|Steals|BPM|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Pistons|59|8.5|1.7|0.323|3.7|0.364|0.436|0.1|\\-7.2|\n|Knicks|17|13.8|2.0|0.441|5.0|0.412|0.500|0.4|\\-3.8|\n|DIFF|\\-|5|0.3|0.118|1.3|0.048|0.074|0.3|3.4|\n\n\n\nThe once offensively challenged Henry Ellenson suddenly shot the ball much better upon joining the Knicks, flipping from a well below average shooter to a well above average shooter. Admittedly the sample size is small, but upon joining the Knicks, while taking more attempts, Henry Ellenson was able to get something to click. And this isn\'t just entirely luck based either. Let\'s look at the shot charts for Henry Ellenson in 2017-2018 (his last season with major playing time) and with the Knicks in 2018-2019:\n\n\n\n[Henry Ellenson 2017-2018](https://imgur.com/gallery/rtGHo94)\n\n\n\n[Henry Ellenson 2018-2019](https://imgur.com/gallery/6gFd8vm)\n\nSince joining the Knicks, is Henry Ellenson gliding over to the left and right corners after off ball screens, spots where he has thrived. His % of Corner3PA has doubled from 20.2% as a Piston to 41.2% as a Knick, and at those spots, he has shot a more than capable 35.7%. Additionally, Henry Ellenson has drastically reduced his number of long midrange shots - from 10% of his FGA as a Piston to 4% as a Knick - and instead has focused on driving and getting shots between 0 and 3 feet, right by the rim (17.7% -&amp;amp;gt; 27.1%), a shot he has always made with ease (lifetime 64% shooter at 0-3 feet).\n\n\n\nBy taking the shortest shot on the court, and driving more to the rack, Henry Ellenson has made himself into something like a post-hype sleeper going into 2019-2020. With a large talent influx due next year (either through FA or the 3rd Overall Pick) it\'ll be interesting to see if Henry Ellenson can turn his successful quarter of a season into a full great season as a secondary option off the New York Knicks, either by converting on pick-and-rolls or dropping back after a nice hard screen offball screen to take a 3 from the corner. Considering Henry Ellenson is due a little less than 2 million USD next year, and was just released by the Pistons, I\'d consider his 2018-2019 season a major success for the Knicks.\n\n\n\n**TLDR;** Henry Ellenson shot more corner threes, less midrange shots, and took more shots at the rim. He may end up being a positive asset on a very interesting 2019-2020 Knicks team just a year after being released by the *Pistons* of all teams.

For reference:

In his minutes without Draymond the Warriors have a -0.9 net rating and a 114.9 defensive rating. Dray without Klay is at a +18 with a 104.6 defensive rating, and neither is a +2.4 and 110.6 defensive rating. He's their 4th best player and he's a great shooter, but that's not something that makes you all NBA.


He's a negative BPM, RPM, RAPM (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQdG8Zv84zqKEzETDjd8KPsClcw9bPETX9v_x_KEAxjv9NrFaWikOoiSaciy1jbMiygg2D-V8DUQn0O/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true), and I believe PIPM as well offhand.  

In his minutes without Curry since joining the NBA he's at about a 53.5%TS

And of the 48 players currently over 10000 minutes played career, Klay's BPM shows him as 4th most overrated when comparing PPG to BPM:

And is currently last in the NBA in playoff PIPM wins added:

And yet I've seen people claim he's a closer to top 15 player who's close to Paul George and better than Westbrook, Butler, or even Gobert.   At some point the argument that the advanced stats don't tell the story seems off when it's not just one stat, its all of them.  He's significantly worse than all these players and he's closer to a Khris Middleton level guy than even current Westbrook, Gobert or Butler (or Oladipo when healthy, Conley, Holiday or Beal).  Is there a statistical case that can be made or is it all just based off team success?  I get that the Warriors are great and he plays his part in it, but by that logic Danny Green was a key to the 2014 Spurs and wasn't nearly all NBA and even the 90s Bulls didn't have their fourth best player on the 3rd team.  

I figured I'd post here to see if someone could provided a solid argument based on Klay himself that wasn't totally dependent on team success and being a great shooter.  I totally agree he's both of those, but being a great shooter on a great team doesn't make you a top 15 player (or even top 20).  It's an honest question and sorry for the slightly lengthy post, but my newest pet peeve has become players who are overrated on efficient scoring who don't provide a ton of overall impact, and every impact (APM) metric I've ever seen says the same about Klay.",False,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,37909,public,self,Klay Thompson and All NBA Voting,0,1559618321,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/bspr8c/klay_thompson_and_all_nba_voting/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the Suns game, the only reason why he played that game was to break the TD record. The Thunder were locked into the 6th seed, they could go no higher or lower in the standings. Him playing that game is no different than Lebron playing against the Knicks in the last game of the season to play 82 games and to keep his 10 point streak going and Klay jacked up 27 shots in his last game against to Jazz to average 20 PPG for the season. I don't see people saying that those players care about their stats more than winning. Against the Warriors, they were up 20 with 2 minutes left - they weren't going to lose that game. So I don't know how he cares about his assists more than winning when the only two instances of him stat-padding assists came in a game that meant nothing and a game that was already won. Has he stat-padded assists before? Yes Does he his assists through stat-padding? No Does he care about his assists more than winning? No

&amp;#x200B;

Here's proof why:

&amp;#x200B;

**Argument: Russ screams at players to shoot not good shots and only passes when he has to**

This is just blatantly false, anyone who says this has never watched an OKC game. Here's a video of every single one of Russ' assists from games 1,2,5 of the playoffs (I couldn't find clips from 3 and 4)

[https://streamable.com/fmumv](https://streamable.com/fmumv)

Also, here's PPP for his potential assists compared to other players viewed as good playmakers

Russ: 1.27 PPP

Wall: 1.35 PPP

Lebron: 1.23 PPP

Lowry: 1.47 PPP

Paul: 1.35 PPP

Simmons: 1.27 PPP

Harden: 1.31 PPP

His PPP is pretty in line with everyone except for Lowry, who is an outlier. It makes sense that his PPP is lower than some of the other players because the shooting around him wasn't that good. The same logic applies to Lebron.

&amp;#x200B;

**Argument: Russ runs the shot clock down and passes it at the last second to get an assist**

This is such an awful argument that can be debunked by watching one OKC game. But I'll provide stats just in case you don't believe me.

OKC was **last** in the league in shots taken with under 5 seconds on the shot clock with 5 shots a game. If Russ was waiting until the end of the shot clock to quickly pass the ball away, wouldn't OKC be much higher on this list? Russ averages over 20 potential assists per game while the entire team only takes 5 of these shots a game. Also, this is completely ignoring that Russ takes 15% of these shots, most definitely not on the floor for all of these shots, and that some of these shots are layups and good shots.

[https://stats.nba.com/teams/shots-shotclock/?Season=2018-19&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;ShotClockRange=4-0%20Very%20Late&amp;sort=FGA&amp;dir=1](https://stats.nba.com/teams/shots-shotclock/?Season=2018-19&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;ShotClockRange=4-0%20Very%20Late&amp;sort=FGA&amp;dir=1)

&amp;#x200B;

**Argument: OKC has the least passes in the league**

This argument is prevalent among pretentious fans who think they're really smart.

OKC is a team full of athletic players who can't create their own shot:

PNR Ball handler:

PG: 1.02 PPP

Dennis: 0.81 PPP

Russ: 0.78 PPP

Ferguson: 0.42 PPP

Isolation:

Paul George: .92 PPP

Russell Westbrook: .86 PPP

Dennis: .75 PPP

Grant: .57 PPP

Off-screen:

PG: 1.10 PPP

Ferg: 0.66 PPP

Spot Up:

Paul George: 1.27 PPP

Dennis: 1.06 PPP

Grant: 1.05 PPP

Ferguson: 1.04 PPP

&amp;#x200B;

Ball movement stems from off-ball screens, dribble hand offs, and other actions. All of the role players on your team are best suited as spot up players and are awful at creating their own shot. So why do you think it would be a good idea to use these players in ways that differ from their strengths.

&amp;#x200B;

People always cite Curry and ask why Russ and the Thunder don't play more like the Warriors. The Warriors move the ball so much because of Curry's and Klay's running off screens and moving off-ball. Russ has no off-ball gravity, not by choice, but because he's one of the worst shooters in the NBA. Russ is best at driving and drawing the defense. It makes no logical sense for him to run off screens because teams would gladly let him take jump shots off-screens. It makes a lot more sense to put the ball in Russ and PG's hands and ask them to create for others.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,37872,public,self,[OC] The narrative that Russ gets his assists through stat padding needs to die,0,1559616840,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/bsmwkj/oc_the_narrative_that_russ_gets_his_assists/,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '3BpAX-U1ujLoCXasa8m6vRCbdN-wnd107LsEFckHmOI', 'resolutions': [{'height': 60, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/dBQlKRP047NfjwIMW2czKJDz2imhizvlGcZDGA2PmJA.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a68012de1752ff921e4161a9b2df83a44ea1c14', 'width': 108}, {'height': 121, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/dBQlKRP047NfjwIMW2czKJDz2imhizvlGcZDGA2PmJA.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d3d601d8fbc0b39976cbe86af04aaabb32fa692', 'width': 216}, {'height': 180, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/dBQlKRP047NfjwIMW2czKJDz2imhizvlGcZDGA2PmJA.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1e59e1e01e439fa0628a1dfdc2f51f627342320', 'width': 320}, {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/dBQlKRP047NfjwIMW2czKJDz2imhizvlGcZDGA2PmJA.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2aa151e373c1b6f05099107b28a91b51f477ddd4', 'width': 640}, {'height': 540, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/dBQlKRP047NfjwIMW2czKJDz2imhizvlGcZDGA2PmJA.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16dabf847592e61ba664aa6b1d1fbf4983480cf8', 'width': 960}, {'height': 607, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/dBQlKRP047NfjwIMW2czKJDz2imhizvlGcZDGA2PmJA.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9214c2b17718680231da0de390c743dfbff0b7b0', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 720, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/dBQlKRP047NfjwIMW2czKJDz2imhizvlGcZDGA2PmJA.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=3f3a52f9ce57f572164beefcece2d9f48137f28f', 'width': 1280}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;neil: Maybe it also says as much about our model’s love for the Raptors’ players as it does about the Warriors’ injury issues. Our ratings think that almost all of Toronto’s current rotation is composed of at least above-average players, if not really good ones. 

&gt;sara.ziegler: Toronto won more games on the season than Golden State and has fewer injuries. Toronto would have the home-court advantage in the finals. Aren’t those important points in the Raptors’ favor?

&gt;chris.herring: I can’t bring myself to think it matters all that much. At least not yet. Golden State has shown it can win despite not having home-court advantage.

&gt;JaredDubin: I think I’d be more inclined to give those things weight if this were the first year of the Warriors’ run and not the fifth, and if we didn’t know that the Warriors essentially treat the regular season as an extended preseason. Draymond Green didn’t even start caring until he went on his crash diet in March, and he’s been one of the, like, three best players in the playoffs.

&gt;chris.herring: If anything, the Durant injury is the thing to watch. They’d obviously be better positioned, and make the Raptors work a lot more, if they had him. (If for no other reason because of Kawhi presumably having to guard him at times.) But the Warriors haven’t given us any reason to suspect they can’t win the way they are. Also, one of the Raptors’ wins over the Dubs was a game in which Curry didn’t play.

So this is just me thinking about it without a fan sway, something I probably couldn't do with the NFL.

&amp;#x200B;

To me, the following candidates are in the running(in no particular order, duh):

&amp;#x200B;

KD, Kawhi, Lebron, Curry, Durant, AD, Harden, Giannis. As an aside, I don't think the NBA has been this talent rich in its entire history. I'm naming 8 all time awesome players.

&amp;#x200B;

I think Lebron if healthy is still the best player, but time is running out on him. I think the laker drama torpedoed whatever resolve he had. He knew he wasn't winning the title so why drag a miserable team to a first round loss.  But that's a boring conversation so let's remove him.

&amp;#x200B;

AD could be the best player, but since he sat out most of the year, his abilities feel like a distant memory. Let's remove him too.

&amp;#x200B;

The last four are the hardest to separate and this really becomes a discussion what ""valuable"" means. Does it mean which player can take an awful team and get them to the most wins? Or does it mean which player can be inserted on a good team and make them great? Or is it some combination and how do you weight those two?

&amp;#x200B;

If its the former - then the best players imo are Harden and Giannis. If it's the latter, it's KD or Curry. If its some 50 50 combo, it's probably Kawhi. Hell, maybe all of these guys are tied. Its such a hair splitting exercise and I can honestly see an argument for any of them. 

&amp;#x200B;

And of course, defense clouds everything.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's my take...I think by the slimmest of margins...its Harden. Yes I know his defense stinks. Yes I know he plays constant iso ball. And yes, he lost to a KD less Warrior team. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I stick to Harden is...I've seen defenses swarm Kawhi and Giannis in this postseason - basically daring them to beat them through an army of arms. And their efficiency drops and we see they rely on their teammates to cut and pass and score. I've seen the same happen to Curry.  

&amp;#x200B;

A word on Curry - part of Curry's dominance is that the Warriors have players who can play off Curry's ability. For instance, when they trap Curry, Draymond such a brilliant player that he knows how to pass and exploit that trap. Klay's presence also effectively removes one help defender at all times. So while Curry is awesome, we need to remember that  Draymond and Klay are also on this team. Curry is also turnover prone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Harden to me is the best passer not named Lebron combined with an ability to drive and shoot. And let's be honest, how talented is Houston offensively anyways now that Chris Paul has declined? They have no bench and Harden has to play a ton of minutes or the Rockets die.  

&amp;#x200B;

KD to me is better than both Giannis and Kawhi, but is he better than Harden? Again, it depends on how you look at value. Harden is a better passer and either tied or slightly below KD as an iso scorer. He's worse defensively, so it becomes a discussion of how much do you weigh passing vs defense and iso scoring. To me, I think the passing makes everyone else dangerous too whereas Kd is just the ultimate scoring trump card. 

&amp;#x200B;

But people don't like Harden because of his ref baiting(I don't like him either for that reason), but in my gut, aside from Lebron, I think its Harden.

Ranked the 505th overall player in 2017-2018 (just behind James Young and Xavier Mumford) Morris etched his name in the Nuggets' rotation early and never looked back. He was a fringe top 100 player this past season and although very talented the one skill that got him to that point was a ridiculous IQ. His assist/turnover ratio is borderline legendary at 3.6 APG/0.6 TPG. That was what he was known for in college as well.

**Here Is a Fact**

There's the LeBron's, the Curry's, Embiid, Giannis. ***If a player is outside of this group and wants to stick around the NBA for a long time, having one specific skill is the best way to do this.***

This could be ANY skill, and I don't mean just on the court. Let me give an example of this:

Jason Smith has been in the NBA since 2007 and on first glance I have zero idea how in the hell Jason Smith has been in the NBA since 2007.

Then I read an article in The Athletic after Smith was traded to Milwaukee, and the Wizards' players were legitimately pissed off that Smith was traded. I'm not talking like ""oh whatever just another trade"" I mean they were prepared for a full blown mutiny.

Why was this? Smith (despite the absolute mess Washington was early on in the season) was friends with everybody in the locker room. He had a lot of positive energy and could easily move from group to group in terms of interactions. Everybody on the team loved him.

Here's my point: Smith's skill is being positive (okay being 7 feet tall helps too, but there's a lot of other 7 footers since 2007 that aren't in the NBA still. I mean who could have guessed Jason Smith would outlast Greg Oden? What even is this timeline?). It's better to be great at one thing than a jack of all trades..or if your LeBron just great at everything but that type of situation is 4 or 5 players out of everyone in the NBA at a time. Probably even less.

**There Will Be Players Next Season Who Not Many Fans Know About That Will Make a Name For Themselves**

Here are examples of that this past season:

*Monte Morris (2017-2018: 505) (2018-2019: Top 130)*

*Malik Beasley (2017-2018: 388) (2018-2019: Top 170)*

*Derrick White: (2017-2018: 398) (2018-2019: Top 170)*

*Thomas Bryant (2017-2018: 466) (2018-2019: Top 190)*

*Derrick Jones Jr (2017-2018: 457) (2018-2019: Top 250)*

5 Players, who spent time in the G-League last year, none ranked higher than the 388th player in the NBA and all made major leaps. All were crucial rotation players during this season.

A few more examples exist, my point is there is a near definite possibility that 5-10 players in 2019-2020 will come out of no where to be important rotation players. There are players who will have been grinding it out with little recognition and their time comes.

**So Here are 3 Players Who Could Shock the NBA in 2019-2020**

I don't mean make a regular or semi-expected jump in progression. I mean quite literally going from hardly any NBA fans (even some regular r/nba or r/nbadiscussion posters) knowing who you are to making an immediate impact in the NBA.

These players I feel very strongly about upon much review. *One of them I believe has top 100, if not 50 overall NBA potential within the next couple of years.* There are more I think will progress but I've narrowed this list down to 3.

**1. Tony Bradley (Utah Jazz)**

If there will be a Monte Morris of next year, Tony Bradley is my overwhelming favorite to be an immediate impact player in the NBA.

I truly believe the Utah Jazz think they have a major hidden gem on their hands and are ready to unleash him next year.

**I will even go as far to say that at the current rate of progression Tony Bradley could be a top 100 NBA player in 2-3 years.**

A late 1st round pick in 2017 (and a favorite of mine at the time) that simply needed a few years. He had beautiful long term potential but everything hadn't come together yet.

He's a 7 footer who's athletic and has always had the defensive ability (1.2 BPG since 2017 in the G-League). Where he developed this year is his offense.

The Jazz experimented with moving him out of the post and all of a sudden Bradley (who was limited to the post) has become the unlikeliest of 3 point shooters. He did only shoot 26% this past season, but he's shooting 1 a game and has made clear development from the previous season.

Not to mention, in the last game of the NBA season dude put up 15 points/10 rebounds/2 blocks/2 steals against the Clippers.

**He is only 21 years old.** Bradley is just one month older than 2019 projected 1st round pick Rui Hachimura.

The Jazz also quite literally do not have a viable backup center to Rudy Gobert right now, and I'm not kidding when I say if Bradley develops the way I think he might **the potential is there for him to be even better than Gobert.**

Sounds crazy? Bradley is the same age right now Gobert was when he was drafted. He has similar defensive potential and is already more versatile on offense than Gobert is right now.

Now, Gobert is a top 3 defensive player and has been the last couple of years. I'm just saying in terms of potential Bradley is further along than Rudy is at the same age.

**2. Wade Baldwin IV (Portland Trail Blazers)**

Anfernee Simons is young and I think learned a lot behind Damian Lillard in his first year in the NBA, and I see an obvious move up the success ladder next season.

Baldwin IV is not on the Trail Blazers anymore, but currently the starting point guard for the Toronto Raptors' G-League affiliate. **I can assure you Toronto is keeping a close eye on him, and I will go as far to say I expect Baldwin IV to be in the Raptors rotation in 2019-2020.**

I think the Raptors are well set up for success clearly but there is a point guard problem behind Kyle Lowry. Fred VanVleet is good enough (although inconsistent) but after that there is a mess. Jeremy Lin doesn't play at all and although this is not a major issue whatsoever, there is an opening for an opportunity next year.

Baldwin IV was a 1st round pick in 2016 by Memphis and for good reason: his physical skills as a point guard were Westbrook-esque. But he was immature, and has floated through the wind the last 3 seasons.

Here's the catch though: he still has the physical skills, has matured, and improved a lot in 2018-2019. In the G-League he averaged 22 PPG, 5 RPG, 4 APG. Good enough, but where he really progressed that makes him stand out his his FG PCT.

*2016-2018: 43% FG, 27% 3 Point in G-League*

*This Season: 48% FG, 35% 3 Point in G-League*

He's always had the physical skills and his efficiency improved from mediocre to excellent.

Still only 23 years old he is in an excellent position, there will be a spot open on Toronto's roster for him to have a chance at the rotation, and I would go as far to say the chances he does get a spot are likely.

**3. Angel Delgado (LA Clippers)**

The G-League Rookie of the Year has one beautiful skill and that's rebounding.

**He averaged 15 rebounds a game.**

Delgado was also a 1st team all G-League player and averaged 11 RPG in 4 years at Seton Hall.

His offensive game is developing as well. 19 PPG on 62% shooting and a slowly developing 3 point shot.

At 6'10, 245 pounds he has NBA level size to match with his skillset.

Having only played 2 games in the NBA this past season, Delgado was outside of my overall top 500. Similar to Morris last year.

But like Morris, he has one very crystal clear NBA level skill and that's rebounding. It's a skill that could give him an 8-10 year career in the NBA as a valuable role player.

Delgado is older than the other 2 prospects mentioned (turns 25 in November) but I could easily see him in the Clippers' rotation next season.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,37857,public,self,3 Players Who Could Shock the World in 2019-2020,0,1559614385,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/bsi7dj/3_players_who_could_shock_the_world_in_20192020/,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,

**Trail Blazers/Terry Stotts**

I feel you should judge NBA coaches based on:

**1. Team performance relative to talent:** *How did we do vs how did everybody think we'd do.*
Nobody thought we'd make the WCF. There was only one playoff series in his entire tenure where we were favored to win and we didn't, and even in that season many were expecting us to not even make the playoffs. 
GRADE: A

**2. Player performance before/after they leave our team:** *Does a player improve when put on a different roster and unencumbered by our coach?
How do Plumlee, Crabbe, Aldridge, Matthews, Batum, etc look? The only guy I can think of who got significantly better was Pat Connaughton. (Is that be*cause Stotts held him back, or Giannis just creates a shitton of wide open threes?) Portland has an outstanding track record on reclamation projects as well (Kanter, Hood and Curry most recently). If I'm an NBA agent and my player's stock is currently low, the Blazers are the top destination on my list. Nobody turns lemons into lemonade like Terry Stotts. 
GRADE: A+

**3. Coach's ability to reach players:** *Do players bitch a lot or fight with the coach?  Is the locker characterized by chemistry and people accepting roles?* 
Widely regarded as one of the best lockers in the league. Portland is loaded with guys who were overlooked/underappreciated. We don't have a single player who is doing worse than expected from when they first joined the team. Nurkic was viewed as a locker room cancer in Denver. Now a lot of that may be Dame and CJ, but good coaches get their stars to be on their page and it's clearly happening here. 
GRADE: B+

**4. Team ability to play a ""modern"" game:** *The NBA constantly evolves. Does our team reflect current best practices?*
We run a guard-oriented pace-and-space team that's pretty much what everybody is trying to do, so our offense is fine. Our defense is predictable, low gambling and relies to much on dropping bigs too much. 
GRADE: B-

**5. Team organization in-game:** *Do we take advantage of 2-for-1s? Do we run out of fouls frequently? Do players play too much/not enough? Do we make adjustments?*
Some of this is pretty subjective. I hate how much we play Turner, for example, but on the other hand maybe the coach sees things on the court or in the locker room that I don't. But overall on the objective stuff (timeouts, out-of-bound play effectiveness, 2-for-1's) Portland is actually really, really good. We definitely should have been better prepared for Warriors small-ball though, and it's clear he's slow to change things up when it's going badly. 
GRADE: B

**6. If we fired the coach today, who replaces him?** *This is a grade for how irreplaceable this coach is vs what's out there.* 
When you look at his body of work and my criteria, it's really hard to argue we'd be better with most other coaches that are available. Portland just isn't a destination franchise. We don't have the talent, the glamor or the history. We spent a decade in coaching hell with Cheeks &amp; McMillan. Run them through my criteria and it's pretty obvious how good we have it now.
GRADE: A

**SUMMARY:**

Stotts isn't a top 5 coach. If we could get one of them, hey, I'm all for it. (If we can give up CJ and get back Giannis, well, sign me up for that too.) But realistically the Blazers aren't going to be a magnet for that kind of coaching talent. We've got about as good as we're likely to get. I'd rather the team focus on roster improvement and developing youngsters, and leave a system that mostly works in place.

In game 1-2 of the Raptors-Bucks series, the Raptors got very little 3-point production from Gasol, Green, Vanleet and Norman Powell. The Bucks were able to swarm Kawhi and limit his scoring. Then the tide turned in the last 3 games. Gasol, VanVleet, Powell start to hit their three-point shots, opening the floor for Kawhi to get to work. **Gasol was 50% from 3 in game 3&amp;4. Powell was 60% in game 3. VanVleet was 100% from three in game 4, 77.8% in game 5.**  Conversely, the Bucks have struggled from deep the entire series **(29.9% from three)**, this in turn limits Giannis production, as evidenced in his relatively poor scoring (This is a glaring criticsm of Giannis game, which is heavily dependent on his teammates hitting 3s. However, if his teammate start to hit their 3s at a normal rate, his production would be much better, IMO). The entire series has changed, thanks to a large part of the role players of Raptors starting to get hot from the 3-point line. 

&amp;#x200B;

Game 6 of the Warriors-Rockets series, the Rockets defence were content with giving Iguodala - a streaky, unreliable 33% career three-point shooter - open looks after open looks. Iggy got **8 good looks from 3s**, most of which in the second half, and he nailed 5, for an amazing **62.5% from three-point range**. Now, if Iggy struggled from distance like he normally would, Rockets would have been more determined on shutting down Curry and Klay, the only reliable shooters in GSW with Durant out, and Curry wouldn't have likely had his historic 4th quarter, and Rocket defense scheme would have looked very good. Iggy's hot-shooting at the right time was game deciding, IMO.

&amp;#x200B;

It seemed very possible with the Brooklyn trade giving them assets year after year and superstar acquisitions. This team was super stacked once a blue moon ago. Then a wild turn of events:

&amp;#x200B;

\-The Celtics objectively won Summer 2017. Fresh off the best record in the East they traded for Kyrie and signed Hayward in addition to acquiring Tatum and the Lakers/Kings (eventually Kings) pick. 

\-Hayward's nasty injury was a harbinger of very bad times for Boston. Granted in hindsight the 2017-18 wasn't a bad one with Tatum/Brown emerging as rising stars and them going on an insane run before Kyrie's injury the back half of the season. Lost to the Cavs in the ECF but without Kyrie or Hayward and with some incredible performances from the young guys. Their outlook was probably its highest after this season w/ Hayward and Irving coming back on next season. Many outlets had them winning the East almost no question.

\-Then of course, Hayward looks nothing like his former self coming back from injury this past season and Kyrie struggles to adjust in Steven's ball-movement heavy system as a dominant iso player. And regressions from Rozier, Brown, and Tatum as they struggle to play with Kyrie. 

With Kyrie very likely leaving, that trade with Cleveland (Zizic, Crowder, 2018 1st round pick- Sexton, 2020 second rd pick), is looking like a win for Cleveland. Granted they gave up a superstar but one that planned on leaving anyway for Sexton who is looking like a solid young player. 

Even the Celtics' prized picks don't look all that nice. Kings pick is #14 (expected this to be top 10 before the season really, Kings played out of their minds this year), Clippers pick is #20. The only diamond in the rough here is the Grizzlies pick which very likely would have conveyed this year had the new lottery rules not been in place. This is still a very valuable pick as it's top 6 protected next season. Who knows how the Grizz will fare though.

&amp;#x200B;

All this being stated it's really shocking and rather ironic to see how a team whose motto is #itsnotluck was fucked over because of luck. Had seemingly all the stars in the right place but now they owe a sizeable chunk of their cap to Horford and Hayward with Kyrie likely on his way out and have to worry about next contracts for Brown (FA after this upcoming season if not extended). Who knows what would have happened if Hayward had never been injured and the Kings and Grizzlies picks fell into more favorable places (Grizz pick still could). 

If you're Boston where do you really go from here? A lot of things are based on uncertainty (AD? Do you go for him even if Kyrie leaves? Do you keep Hayward even though he takes touches from Brown and Tatum? Do you give a hefty contract to Brown? Make no mistake though, this is a make or break summer for Boston. They could end up being serious contenders or seriously irrelevant based off one move alone. All in all, though I can't say I see them ever coming close to what they were supposed to be headed towards two seasons ago, all because of bad luck. Can't even say they have the brightest future (Denver, LA Clips) when I would have undoubtedly said that last season.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,37635,public,self,Devastating Turnaround for the Celtics... can they ever get to where they were projected to be?,0,1559609034,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/bs7ygg/devastating_turnaround_for_the_celtics_can_they/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10x All Star

Lets say he goes to the Knicks. He has 5 more prime years from 30-35 year old. He probably wins 1 or 2 more Rings. 1 or 2 more FMVP's. 1 or 2 more MVP's. Makes All NBA 4x, All Star 5x.  Then in his last 3 years he wins another title as a 2nd or 3rd option. Makes another All Star game.

6x Champion

3x MVP

5x FMVP

5x Scoring Champion

Top 5 in Points per game Regular season and Playoffs

17x All Star

This would put KD firmly in the GOAT conversation. How could it not?  KD would basically be the modern day KAJ except more versatile. His 6 Rings would probably elevate him over Lebron's 3 Rings. His overwhelming accomplishments probably put him over Bird/Magic's relatively short careers. 

Basically only Jordan would be a challenger. But in 8 years the value of the 3-point shot will be even more amplified. The value of versatile defenders will be more amplified. Having a 7-footer who can guard all 5 positions will be even more important. Many will say that Jordan's lack of a 3-point shot and being 7 inches shorter then KD would be knocks against him. 

The narrative will be very strong. Especially if he wins 3 Rings with the Knicks. A ton of media will be tripping over each other to push the KD GOAT narrative.

This is why we need to take small sample sizes with a huge grain of salt. Especially sample sizes that are spread over multiple years. Yes the Warriors are 5-0 without KD this playoffs. Yes they have look really good. But lets not forget context.

Houston has a history of choking. Especially when CP3 isn't healthy CP3. CP3 was not healthy this year. Lets not forget that Houston got eliminated at home just 2 years ago. Kawhi was injured and the Spurs still beat Houston by 40 points in an elimination game. Houston/Harden choking against a short-handed team is not something new.

Sweeping Portland also does not prove the Warriors can win a Ring without KD. Frankly Portland would have probably lost in the first round if they were on the other side of the bracket. They easily lose to the Warriors, Rockets, or Jazz. And did we not forget that just last year the Blazers got swept by the Pelicans? Did that sweep convince us that the Pelicans could win the Ring? Hell no. And don't forget the Pelicans absolutely destroyed the Blazers and didn't have to come back 3 times by 17 points. They won each game by an average of 10 points. Also Nurckic was playing last year.

Are the Warriors without KD a contender? Yes. They would have shot of winning the Ring. But they would not be the favorite. They probably lose to Lebron in 2017 and Houston last year. They would be an underdog against Houston, Raptors, and Bucks. Can you remember the last time a team won a chip by winning two series where they were an underdog? Hardly ever happens.

Their combination of successful areas from the team's uniform history really worked out well. The red-shadowed 3D font is a thing of beauty on the white association and blue icon uniforms. I love that the red statement uniform features blue as the predominant siding and trim color, not white. To me, it makes the red seem more vibrant. The only thing to tweak would be the font on this jersey, which looks too close to saying ""Suxers"", but still a great uniform. The gray city jersey completely fulfills its task to represent a part of the city's history, paying homage to Rocky. Lastly, the white earned uniform, used throughout the playoffs this season as their primary white uniform, is a beautiful recoloring of their gray uniform. Even down to the tri-colored waistband of the earned uniform, eveything about it is perfect, even without a wordmark logo. Finally, the ad patch is a top-3 look IMO, blending in very well with the jerseys and looking a lot better than most of the league (looking at you OKC).


Jazz are probably my 2nd-favorite team. Despite using every color of the rainbow in their uniform sets, theirs also looked close to perfection. That throwback uniform is an absolute beauty!!! Plus, their city uniform, meant to represent the climate of Utah, reminds me a whole lot of Dig Dug (not a bad thing since the 1980's still rock!)

1. In college/NBA basketball, what are the main offensive sets and defensive sets that I should study as an aspiring player to aid me in developing basketball IQ? So, far I have (**Offensive: 5-Out Motion, 1-4, Princeton (Low, Point, Chin), Flex, Zone Offense**) and (**Defensive: Run and Jump Press, Pack, Zone Defense**).
2. Other than Youtube videos (which are mostly enough), are there any other comprehensive tutorials/summaries/explanations of these different types of offensive and defensive schemes?
3. Do college/NBA teams mainly run the same offensive sets and cycle intermittently through all the variations throughout a game, or do they sometimes completely change offensive schemes and run a completely different set?
4. How much of an actual game is trying to run sets vs improvising on the fly in the half-court? I feel like focusing too much on running particular sets takes away mental energy from looking for better opportunities and finding weaknesses in the opponent's defense.
5. Is there a place I can better figure out these things other than talking to a coach/experienced professional? Is there some sort of coach's handbook or something along those lines? I've never played on a team/in organized basketball before, which is exactly what I'm trying to catch up on so I can be at the top of my game when trying out for a team.
6. How well do most players know the ins-and-outs of offensive/defensive sets in contrast to just knowing what their coach teaches them? Is it normal for players to have a solid understanding of all the different types of offensive and defensive schemes their opponents are running? Is that what they study when they watch film?

Both teams are elite defenses and it has become a chess battle of limiting each others superstar.

Toronto's defense, in particular, has been extremely effective these playoffs that trend continues against Milwaukee.

# The Wall

Thus far the Raptors have allowed an 83.5 ORTG by Milwaukee in the half court.  For context the worst half-court offense in the regular season, the Knicks had an ORTG of 88.

How the Raptors have done this is by [forming a fucking wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2IGueMF-Ec)

[Heres what the Wall looks like when Giannis has the ball](https://imgur.com/UsEKXYt.jpg)

[and here's what it looks like when Giannis is in the paint](https://imgur.com/Jk93rzl.jpg)


The rules of the Wall are as follows

* Giannis must always see bodies between him and the rim when he has the ball
* Giannis will be hard doubled whenever he attempts to dribble or post up
* The help defender will  try to prevent the spin move in the paint
* Giannis can shoot as much as he wants outside the paint

Here are some examples in real time

[Preventing the Spin move](https://streamable.com/q13ah)


#Why it works so well
So with all this attention on Giannis, Milwaukee's shooters should be having a field day right?

The answer is no and that's thanks to two major factors

- excellent defensive rotations by Toronto's players

-  forcing Giannis to make extremely tough passes


The Wall is showcasing one of Giannis is a weakness, is that while he is a good passer he isn't a particularly accurate one.

The defense forces Giannis into making some tough passes and the ones he does deliver aren't always on target and allow Toronto's defense time to close out 

Heres some examples

[Slow Pass no time for Hill to shoot
](https://streamable.com/2f5x0)

[Pass way off target forces a stagnant possesion](https://streamable.com/wqt4r)



The other reason why this strategy has been so effective is that Toronto is filled to the brim with excellent help defenders, Kyle Lowry, Marc Gasol, Danny Green, Fred VanVleet and especially Kawhi Leonard has allowed Toronto to execute this scheme at a very high level.


Kawhi Leonard especially who seems to be on one leg yet had provided DPOY level defense these past 2 games

[He does an excellent job contesting Giannis within the Wall

[and his help defense is as elite as ever](https://streamable.com/bl6hu) 


Another benefit of matching up Leonard with Giannis is that it allows [Leonard to completely ignore Giannis whenever he doesn't have the ball and provide help defense](https://imgur.com/LkPfjpD.jpg) 

#Concluding Remarks

This type of defense isnt a particularly new concept, in fact, the Celtics used the exact same strategy the previous round. It just didn't work as well for them largely because of the gap in defensive talent.

**Counters for the Bucks**

- The Bucks could adjust by running more PnR both on-ball and off-ball making rotations much harder for Toronto. They generated some very good looks with this last game.

- Play less Bledsoe, the Bucks already reduced his minutes in game 4 so not sure how much less they can play him but Toronto has completely ignored him defensivey and made life much harder for the rest of the Bucks",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,37537,public,self,How the Raptors are slowing down the Bucks,0,1559601099,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/brstyn/how_the_raptors_are_slowing_down_the_bucks/,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'POWNdFux_1i9tS-E3TwEMg0CaAq-urTfzOl2TF4lWc0', 'resolutions': [{'height': 54, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/DsuL3fiy9beHiwcQ6E3imvWr2YJMlh_5XwdPT85RGBc.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b84d6438e6c2dd1e7ec8b9678598db2185c4543a', 'width': 108}, {'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/DsuL3fiy9beHiwcQ6E3imvWr2YJMlh_5XwdPT85RGBc.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e4f4c54b2fc2a0e6c897c0113740d2da94fc233', 'width': 216}, {'height': 161, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/DsuL3fiy9beHiwcQ6E3imvWr2YJMlh_5XwdPT85RGBc.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0106de49fd716433982f70946329f9334cec119', 'width': 320}, {'height': 322, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/DsuL3fiy9beHiwcQ6E3imvWr2YJMlh_5XwdPT85RGBc.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad60d2cbcf6cb682932528eaa60d9c809c9ebd63', 'width': 640}, {'height': 483, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/DsuL3fiy9beHiwcQ6E3imvWr2YJMlh_5XwdPT85RGBc.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=158bab4e5ba0c72f8565f8683835f47f78d18f48', 'width': 960}, {'height': 544, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/DsuL3fiy9beHiwcQ6E3imvWr2YJMlh_5XwdPT85RGBc.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23710455aecd253bad3c52614297c985ea63d585', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 957, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/DsuL3fiy9beHiwcQ6E3imvWr2YJMlh_5XwdPT85RGBc.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=f10e8ef03dfc691179aefe6b8fe93e1e60735cce', 'width': 1899}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,

I'm thinking Curry and MJ at 1 and 2. 
Durant at 3. Miami LeBron at 4, and Tim Duncan at 5.

I'm choosing Curry to open the floor with his shooting, and his playmaking. 

MJ because he's MJ. 

Durant because he's of the best sfs of all time, he can defend and rebound and is a matchup nightmare, but mostly because he can shoot and space the floor.

LeBron is LeBron, he does (did, in Miami) everything well, and is a great secondary playmaker when MJ is tired. 

And Duncan over guys like Wilt or Kareem because Duncan doesn't need the ball, he's an amazing defender, passer and rebounder, unselfish, intelligent, great team player. I feel like the other big men like shaq wouldn't be as effective in this role, and I want my offense going through MJ, LeBron, and maybe a little Curry instead of relying on post play from the great big men of the past. 

I'm considering swapping LeBron for Bird actually - this current team only has 2 knockdown shooters, but swapping LeBron for Bird means there are three guys opening the lane for MJ and Bird is still an all time great. Plus you could run some crazy plays with Curry, Duncan and Bird, those guys are super crafty.

Think again.  If Lebron gets hit with a season ending injury the Lakers will become the New York Knicks of the west and still make tons of money.

$4 Billion!  $200 million for the next 20 years is what local TV provider, Time Warner Cable, is paying the Lakers to air their games!  This is their most lucrative revenue stream and a little more than 50% of this revenue will cover their annual player salary.  It probably covers their entire organization salary!  Boycotting season tickets,  boycotting merchandise, boycotting attending 50% of their games is not going to put a dent in their bottom line.  


What will?  For starters, attack their revenue by disrupting how people watch the games.  A decline in viewership could lead to a restructure of the TV contract or end it all together.  


Increase their cost.  It would be tough to increase their highest fixed cost, the Staples center lease deal.  They are essentially paying 33% of the lease cost since they are sharing the stadium with two other franchises.  And it’s in the King’s (hockey) and Clippers best interest to keep em in there.  Pressure on the league to require the franchise to have their own stadium could increase their cost.  Pressure other major sports franchises to seek new stadiums outside of the A.G.E ownership group (Warriors moving out of Oracle is the first step).


These all seem like long shots, but I’m not sure what else could get them to focus on winning games again?  Without the pressure of hitting profitability objectives there is no guarantee they will act in the fans best interest.

The Pelicans didn't have to come back from three 17 point deficits. The Pelicans crushed the Blazers, they had no need to make miracle comebacks. So why is everyone acting like the Warriors without KD is the 2016 Warriors again? Flatout the Blazers are not that good at all. 

Another stupid argument is the Warriors are so much more fun and play much more entertaining ball without KD. Sure the Warriors were having alot of fun and the game was wide open. So many people saying they miss this version of the Warriors. But that's more to do with the Blazers. The Blazers are the Goodwill version of the Warriors.

Because of his inability to shoot, he cannot space the floor and the team's center, Joel Embiid, must take up this mantle. This is not conducive to the team or Joel, who shoots at approximately 30% from the three. Several times during the season, I've seen Ben dribble half a step into the paint while the defender camps under the rim and refuse to even look at the basket, instead, looking for his favorite bail-out, JJ Redick. Except this post-season Redick's play has declined and Ben can no longer depend on JJ's off the handoff threes to make him an offensive threat anymore

As obnoxious, detrimental and head scratching Ben Simmons refusal to shoot even a midrange is, what's even more shocking is lack of in-paint moves. This encompasses both post moves and complex one handed finishing moves, like floaters. Ben's favorite move is to beat his opponent off the dribble, glide into the open lane with his long legs and slam the ball. Besides that there is little else he can do *well*. 

I've seen Ben use euro steps, back his opponents down then attempt a turn around jumper, but he does not do it often or well. When his teammate is transcendent talent Joel Embiid, Ben's inability to command respect in the paint is even more obvious.

Ben's lack of in-paint finishing is even worse for the Sixers because they cannot move their 6'10 240 lb player to the power forward position and have to watch him muddle through the PG position while refusing to space the floor. 


 This may be wildly unpopular but Ben's passing ability is not transcendent or exceptional. He's 23 and has refused to learn a proper jumper. (he doesn't get participating points for shooting with bad form). If the Sixers want to be Eastern Conference Champions and eventually NBA champions when the Warriors age out, they must offer Ben an ultimanium: have a decent looking midrange jumper by 1/3 of the season or be traded for a PG who will shoot.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,37352,public,self,Ben Simmons' refusal to develop a proper jumpshot is bad.

I think anyone with a practical sense would say no -- just like with Russell Westbrook (full disclosure, Westbrook is my favorite player and I will defend him tooth and nail) this would be a terrible decision for the franchise.  The reason is simple: there are only maybe half a dozen superstars you can build around with low contract value players and still be competitive.  Lillard is not one of those players.  The Blazers giving Lillard said contract would hamstring the Blazers for at least 5 years and they will completely rely on favorable playoff matchups to compete for a championship.  Just like Westbrook and the Thunder.

In said thread I described a different style of salary cap and /r/helpneeded8578 suggested I made a self post to see if a better discussion could be made around it.  So I'm making said self-post to see if others agree with this method or if I'm just a crazy person:

&amp;#x200B;

\------

&amp;#x200B;

The thing about the salary cap is that there are two very different things the league is trying to accomplish: pay players what they are worth but try to keep a competitive balance.  What you get is players and agents fighting for pay raises (which they should get) but this directly impacts the quality of team they can field.  So a star player like Durant ***technically*** should take the vet min to play on another team so he can field a better team.

But the integrity of the salary cap is dictated on players being paid what they are worth.  What we have tho is a history of very few players ever being paid what they are worth.  And when they are, how insulting is that?  How many times have we as fans talked about leveraging a star young player on their rookie contract so the team can build a winner around him?  That player is giving X value to a team that is disproportional to the cap on the team.

So I have two stances:

1. Players should get paid whatever they can leverage
2. Teams should have a semblance of balance when trying to build out a roster, and the league should have measures that make this as equal as possible

Right now everyone uses the excuse of ""your team is bad because your management is bad"", and they are not wrong.  But even if we have, in theory, 30 world-class front offices, ***someone*** has to be 30th on that list.  And the current system severely punishes that team.

So what I have been suggesting for years is a salary slot system.  This is a system that leans into parity of teams.  The idea is pretty simple:

1. Each team has multiple slots of differing levels (detailed later)
2. These slots are determined at the time of signing, but a player can be upgraded or downgraded based on a system of stats, team performance, or individual awards.
3. The actual salary the player receives is indicative of the slot the player is in.  Meaning a player can be paid slightly less when downgraded (but not too much) or a ton more if upgraded (including rookies)

The idea is that teams are built with the quality of players in mind.  The cap still technically remains.  Just now it's completely percentage based as opposed to compensation based.  And teams can still go above the cap if they want because there are explicit slots allowed for going above the cap.  This means ***nuke the fucking luxury tax from orbit***.  Seriously -- the luxury tax is the worst teambuilding rule in the history of sports.  It was sold on the idea to help small market teams but in reality it ***only*** punishes small market teams.  It's ludicrous and an excellent example of how messed up the league was in 2012.

There is still an idea of a salary cap in the form of the players share of basketball related income (BRI).  Basically the system that determines the current salary cap is still the reference point for how much the players get paid.

The way I've bounced it around in my head is that the initial model should be built around the ""big 3"" which everyone has loved for decades.

1. Max Slot (40% of cap).  Salary is unlimited
2. Second Star Slot (30% of cap).  Can give between 25% and 40% of what we now think of the salary cap
3. Third Star Slot (20% of cap).  Can give between 20% and 30%
4. Sixth-Man Slot (20%).  Let's just straight up call out the sixth man in team building because every fan loves it.  By making a rule where a team can pay a player who comes off the bench but gets &lt;30mpg means we'd see more players embrace it.
5. Starter (15%)
6. Bench Mob (7%)
7. Minimum Contract Guys (0%)

That doesn't add up to 100%.  The idea is that the % is based on the earned income of the player, and is used as a reference spot for todays world.  With my idea, in 5 years the % would go away because it would mean nothing except as a reference for what a player could earn.

Players can go up and down the slot depending on their performance.  The NBA would enact a year-end performance review that takes into account on-court performance, minutes, team role, age, injuries, and any other factors that may come up.  Meaning a player like Westbrook would be reviewed as a non-max slot guy and be downgraded to the Second Star slot, freeing up another Max Slot for OKC.  But George, who was an MVP candidate, would be upgraded to the Max Slot and see his potential income raise to a floor of 40%, but possibly more if the team wanted it. Russ would see his salary decrease to the max range of the Second Star Slot, meaning his ""unlimited"" money is no longer unlimited.

Same with Rookies.  Ben Simmons would be earning 30% right now instead of whatever is rookie contract gives him.

Then comes backdoor rule to prevent super teams -- ***you cannot have 2 max slot players on a team.***  You have X years to remove a max slot player from your team by some means -- either their contract expires or you trade the player for other future assets.  Treat OKC with Russ and KD as a litmus test here: Russ was rarely given honest consideration for a top 5 player while with OKC.  But during the window he was, then OKC would have been told they need to trade one of Russ or KD.  ***However***, that trade market is wide fucking open because they just need to trade them into a max slot -- something that likely ***20 other teams*** have open.  Can you imagine the haul Russ at age 26 would get OKC if the option was to trade him to any other team without a max player as opposed to ""who can absorb his contract""?

\---

Now that salaries are so high the 12th man on a roster earns more than most NFL quarterbacks, I think a socialist / egalitarian view of the salary cap makes sense.  Now if the league determines a player will earn X less, it accounts to a much smaller net worth to the player than it would in, say, 2007 when a min player would be earning less than a million a year.  Even if my idea isn't perfect, I think anything that refocuses the leagues effort to actually combat equality among all the teams will help improve viewership.

Basically, the league shouldn't look at the recent Heatles and GSW teams as proof that super teams bring in the money.  IMO the accessibility of streaming and the increase in availability of basketball courts in the USA is a better indication of why the NBA is succeeding.  Parity and the idea that a fan of ***any*** team can think their team has a chance of winning a championship is why that league is still kicking the NBA's ass despite dozens of scandals is what the office should look at.  And hopefully they can enact that reform while interest is high.",False,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,37315,public,self,[OC] A different take on the NBA Salary Cap,0,1559594308,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/brgej5/oc_a_different_take_on_the_nba_salary_cap/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Last year, he was persistent on trapping Ricky Rubio on the pick and roll. This allowed Rubio to play to his strengths and be a passer. As a result, Ingles killed them on corner 3s because trapping the PNR forces the weak side defender to drop down and allows for corner 3s. In addition, he refused to take Melo off the floor when he got continuously destroyed by Donovan Mitchell in the PNR. He realized Melo was unplayable in game 5, yet still played him the first 5 minutes of the 3rd quarter of game 6 which allowed for Mitchell to get hot and Utah to get a double digit lead. OKC may have won that game if Billy sat Melo during those minutes.

This year, it took him 3 games to realize to trap Dame and even then, they didn't do it cohesively. They would still try to ice him on some PNRs which they did horribly and almost always lead to open 3s from Dame. Then, in game 5, he thought it would be a good idea to force the guy who was on fire the entire series to have the ball is his hands even more by switching the PNR. Dame proceeded to go off for 50. Some of the defensive issues stem from personnel, but he primarily played a Dennis- Russ- Ferg - PG - Grant lineup in Game 5. Every single one of those players in mobile enough to trap Dame in the PNR, yet he refused to do so.

This is my favorite website and we could use a few more members. 

&amp;#x200B;

In short, the website has a database of every season of every NBA&amp;ABA player ever - and each season of each player is assigned a salary. You are working within a salary cap and you get to build a 12 man roster to compete in a simulated season of 82 simulated games (plus playoffs) against other teams within a league. You can set your starters/bench, target minutes for each player, coaching preferences and make slight opponent adjustments, but most of it comes down to how well you drafted...however, it gets way more advanced the deeper you dive.

&amp;#x200B;

Users have taken to the forums to create custom ""theme"" leagues, and this is where it gets really fun IMO. Heads up: leagues do cost. You can win free or discounted seasons by making the playoffs and winning playoff rounds - and one season lasts about 1 month in the forum (drafting/trading/etc) and about 2 months in the SIM. Types of different leagues that exist:

**Progressive leagues:** These leagues work a lot like running a real-life team as a GM. When the league is founded, the commissioner picks a starting year (lets use 1979 as an example) and all 24 owners go through a huge draft to draft every player who existed in that year. For this type of league, you'll want to value the player as a whole including their age - as in how many years they have left in their career and how many of those are good seasons. After you draft your 12-man squad for the inaugural season, the season runs as normal (82 simulated games where you make some settings and preference adjustments) plus playoffs and eventually a champion. In the ""offseason"" there is a lottery, a draft of all incoming players (so since this hypothetical league started in 79-80, the draft would be for all players who debuted in 80-81), trades can be made between teams and then you can drop anyone and add a FA after the draft - all done within the forums. These leagues are fun because they go year after year with mostly the same group of owners and you can plan for the future, tank, retool, keep trading your late firsts to try to keep your contender alive...whatever you would like to do as GM. I've got a team right now that is in the 09-10 season and I have rookie Harden, young Mike Conley, Andrew Bynum and Nic Batum and I am tanking for one more year before I start making a decade long push for contention. It's pretty fun to try to trade and draft your way in to contention. These forums are hidden and you have to be a member of the league to see them. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Draft leagues:** These are one-off leagues that revolve around a big draft. A salary cap is set prior to the draft (some are low-cap and challenging, some are a higher cap) and the player pool is determined (most drafts have every player ever available, but some run for a certain decade of players or even just one real-life NBA season). No duplicates are allowed, meaning that when someone drafts Steph Curry, they can only use one season of him and no one else can use any Steph Currys. There is usually a snake-order draft or something similar. These are really fun and challenging. The season runs as normal using the drafted teams. Here is the most recent draft: [https://www.whatifsports.com/forums/Posts.aspx?topicID=514047](https://www.whatifsports.com/forums/Posts.aspx?topicID=514047&amp;TopicsTimeframe=365)

&amp;#x200B;

There are also other leagues people have created that have very unique rules. One league I am in you own 12 players but the season you get from them is random (between all possible years of there career) and then you lose 2 random players each season and those players make up the next draft class. It's interesting because you have to factor in a player's whole career (like MJ's MIA seasons) when valuing players for trades and drafting.

**Open leagues:** These are run by the website and anyone can simply enter any team with no real rules aside from a salary cap. This might be a good place to start but it's certainly not the most fun.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**So how does it work?**

The SIM uses players real life stats to determine outcomes of each possession of a game. There is stamina that is based on how many minutes that player played in real life. All stats are based on %s, which helps compare eras better. Don't focus on things like PPG - you want to instead look at that player's usage % to see how often he shot/got fouled/turned the ball over per 100 possessions, and then his eFG% to see how efficiently he scored on that usage. Drafting too much usage will lead to losses, simply because usage factors in to the player's salary (you're paying for it) and if you draft 6 guys that all need 25 shots a game, they're not going to all get their touches but you will have paid for those touches you never got. It's better to draft a couple of high usage/high efficiency guys and use the rest of your money on rebounding, passing, defense, etc...

&amp;#x200B;

You'll want to not focus so much on the name-value of the player and instead focus on the numbers they give you. Allen Iverson isn't very good in this game. Richaun Holmes is. Speaking of Richaun Holmes, you'll want to look at ""position effectiveness"". It will tell you how effective a player is at all 5 positions. Some of it is common sense. You don't want to play Shaq at SG. Some of it is a little weird but you can use it to your advantage. Lots of real life PFs like Dennis Rodman, Elton Brand, Serge Ibaka, Richaun Holmes, Horace Grant are 100% effective at SF for some reason. If you can live with their lack of 3s (by drafting guys like Steph who give you an abundance) then putting one of these guys at SF with 2 true big men at PF and C can give you a big rebounding advantage. 

&amp;#x200B;

You'll want to draft enough 3s (I aim for at least 400 3PM for a season based on my drafted players' real-life stats) so that your opponent doesn't pack the paint on you. Defense is important and if you do it right, you can draft 3 good defenders who can ""switch"" with your bad ones (like a good defensive player who is 95%+ at PG and SG and a bad defensive player who is 95%+ at PG and SG). 

&amp;#x200B;

There is going to be a lot of trial and error, most of it will be learning from experience. However, here are 2 good threads written by another user with lots of helpful info:

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to jump in to a theme league, this would probably be a good start. You simply comment with the name of a franchise that hasn't been claimed yet and over the next week or so just build the best 12-man squad you can from players who played for that franchise, under the salary cap the commissioner set. Then you'll compete against others who did the same.

So you don't really want the ball in Giannis hands at the end of the game. And since Giannis can't shoot that also means the defense does not have to guard him off ball. That means they can sag off of him and pack the paint even more. His lack of shooting actually hurts the Bucks spacing even more when the ball isn't in his hands.

Giannis is also a high turnover player. For the Toronto series he has 18 assists and 17 turnovers. You just can't turnover the ball in these big game situations.

2. Eric Gordon is a top 30 player, right? Or am I trippin'? I love that dude. He's pretty much unstoppable when he's going to the rim. The only chance the other team can guard him is if he's just missing 3s. He's extremely underrated in my opinion.

3. I have this theory going right now. In my opinion there are winning players and losing players. Winning players include Draymond Green, Mike Conley, Jrue Holiday. I could go on, it's whatever. Of course this is going to cause some contraversy, but my losing players include Devin Booker, Russell Westbrook, D'Angelo Russell and DeMar DeRozan. 

4. Lou Williams and Khris Middleton have to be the best shoot in your face guys, right? KD doesn't really count because he shoots over you. But whenever Middleton or Williams take a shot, I feel like it's going in.

In the end, we were evaluating benches over different criteria, so we couldn't really agree on a top 3.

My short list:

1. Bucks. I'm obviously biased as a Bucks fan, but I've seen them run 9 deep all year and it's telling when guys like George Hill are difference makers in deep playoff games. Not everyone lights it up very night, but I feel very comfortable banking on the fact at least one guy off the bench has a good to great game, every game. In my opinion, they easily have the deepest bench which allows for continuity in the game plan when some starters aren't playing well.
2. Clippers. Two of their guys are candidates for 6th man, and both played great basketball in the playoffs against the best team in the league. Clippers don't necessarily have the deepest bench, but having two really solid guys in Williams and Harrell buys them a lot of flexibility with their line ups, and that advantage can't be overstated. Doc has done a really great job squeezing out maximum efficiency in their limited minutes, particularly for Lou.
3. Warriors. The one my friend disagreed heavily with, so I'm wondering what y'all think. Outside of Looney, I don't think anyone else is really that talented, but for me, their ability to allow Kerr to continue running his system is what sets them apart. We've seen Kerr roll out the 4 bench + 1 starter line up with pretty good success. You could argue that's really because of the one starter he leaves out (usually Klay or Steph), but I would argue it takes a smart bench to really make it work.

Just from the eye test he looks no where close to how dominant he was in the regular season. In the regular season he was very 2000 Shaq-like in dominance. Teams didn't have a prayer and he simply destroyed people. But in the playoffs he looks very human so far. And this is shocking considering the majority of the games were against a very weak Piston team without a healthy Blake and a Boston team that gave up half way through the series.

I think Giannis is 'struggling' because he is a 1-level scorer. He is only elite at the rim. While 4-level scorers (3 point, mid-range, at the rim, free throws) like KD, Steph, and Harden are able to attack playoff defenses in many ways. It simply is very easy to game plan for a player who only can score 3 feet from the rim. Look at Giannis 4 levels so far this playoffs:

3-Point: 29.5% well below average

Mid Range: 21.5% woefully bad

At the Rim: 72.4% elite

Free throws: 66.2% Terrible

So Giannis is absolutely struggling in 3 of the 4 levels of scoring.

Now compare his regular season stats to post-season:

FG% from 57.8% to 49.8%

2FG% from 64.1% to 55.2%

eFG% from 60.0% to 52.9%

FT% from 72.9% to 66.2%

TS% from 64.4% to 57.9%

PTS/36 from 30.4 to 28.2

Those are massive drop offs. Giannis went from a Shaq-like dominance in the regular season to this years playoff Paul George ( 28.6 points on 58.3% TS for George). Giannis this year reminds of early Lebron. 2007-2009 Lebron who was an absolute physical freak but would struggle against elite defenses because of his lack of a jumper. 

But others may say this is just playoff basketball. Stats go down because of playing better teams in higher intensity. This is true....for most  players. But not for the ELITE players. 

KD from 63.1% TS regular season to 65.5% TS playoffs. Scoring 8+ more points per game.

Kawhi from 60.6% TS to 63.6% TS. Scoring 4 points more per game

Curry from 64.1% TS to 62.9% TS.

Lebron(2018) from 62.1% TS to 61.9% TS. Scoring 6+ more points per game

As you can see the truly elite scorers actually raise their game in the playoffs instead of decline. Even someone like Curry who was in a massive slump and was fighting multiple injuries has only dipped his TS% very slightly. 

Then look at impact. The Bucks are barely better with Giannis on the court.

Giannis playoff ON/OFF: +1.7

Bucks are only +1.7 points better per 100 possessions when Giannis is on the court. Just shows how strong the Bucks bench is and how they hardly miss a beat when he's off the court. 

Giannis has been even worse against the Raptors so far:

22.0 points per game on 50.3% TS

42.3% FG

64.5% FT

20.0% 3FG

18 assists with 17 turnovers.

This Bucks team is a real fluid team that, while has a supremely dominant player in Giannis, they don't rely on him to the degree the Cavs did with LeBron. I think they have some components that will exploit some of the Warriors past weaknesses, like youth, length and athleticism.

Milwaukee has 8 guys who have averaged over 20 mpg this postseason while the Warriors only have 5. Middleton has the highest mpg with 33.5, while the Warriors have 4 guys higher mpg than that(the big4).  Combine the fact that the Warriors main players are older with the fact they are having to play a lot more mins and I think that plays a role in the Finals. It think it would be huge for the Warriors if they could sweep Portland and the Raptors could force a game 6 or 7, giving them most rest and more time for Durant to heal up. 


Of course they lost in 2016, but they were up 3-1 when Draymond got suspended and during that game Bogut got hurt and would not return for the remainder of the series and Curry's 2 postseason injuries that forced him to miss the first series plus other games certainly hurt them. They potentially sweep that series without those issues. 

Assuming everyone besides Cousins is healthy, I still think this is a 6-7 game series and will really test the Warriors. Their toughest test, yet.

I can think of a host of other duds. Any theory of why certain players do well from moving up and others don't? Jokic isn't athletic like Lebron or Zion, which was the knock on his game and why he dropped 40 in the draft; Draymond lacked a jumper/didn't seem like a star, so he dropped as well - with both having had great stats in college/playing overseas. Others with great stats/similar athleticism, like jared sullinger/Mike Muscala don't seem to pan out. 

The pre-draft board numbers/rankings seem to measure mostly how the player is perceived at the moment/their buzz, rather than the actual quality of their play/ability to become a pro. College numbers seem a bit better, with being in the top 10 list of certain categories being a good sign of potential success (Zion for example is posting numbers college numbers similar to Duncan), but then their are players like Beasley who never translate or the almost 50% of players who make it in the top 10-20 but never even get drafted. 

Anyways, just curious what your thoughts are. Drafting correctly in today's NBA seems to be the most important key to success. It's why Warriors or Oklahoma had their run, it's why Denver and Milwaukee did as well as they did, with Giannis and Joker. Would be interesting to have a discussion about factors besides ""this player style reminds me of this player"", as that doesn't seem to be a good predictor (can lead to head-scratching choices like picking Anthony Bennett over Victor Oladipo because the player they mimic is better, instead of the actual players themselves).",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,37103,public,self,College game translating to NBA.

Before KD got to Golden State Steph averaged over 24ppg once. 
In his first MVP season he went 23.8 pts, 7.7 Ast, and 4.3 rebounds. On 16.8 Shots per game. 
In the Playoffs he went 28.3 pts, 6.4 Ast, 5 reb on 20.9 Shots per game. 

In his unanimous MVP season he went 30.1 pts, 6.7 Ast and 5.4 rebounds. He did all of that on 20.2 Shots per game.
In the playoffs that year he went 25.1 pts, 5.2 Ast, 5.2 rebounds. On 18.8 Shots per game.

With KD....

2016-2017 ( regular season)- 25.3 pts, 6.6 Ast, 4.5 reb. On 18.3 Shots per game.
(Playoffs)- 28.1 pts, 6.7 Ast, 6.2 rebounds. 

2017-2018 ( regular season)- 26.4 pts, 6.1 Ast, 5.1 rebounds. On 16.9 Shots per game. He played 51 games that season.
(Playoffs)- 25.5 pts, 5.4 Ast, 6.1 rebounds. On 20.3 Shots per game. 

2018- 2019. ( regular season)- 27.3 pts, 5.2 Ast, 5.3 rebounds. On 19.4 Shots per game.



I don't think anyone expected Steph to go for 30 again but the numbers we are seeing with kd is where i think he would be without him. Kd is also a great defender, making it harder for teams to just focus on attacking Steph when the death lineup is playing. 
The case against kd holding back Steph and the team was that there isn't enough ball movement and that they go iso. To go iso is isolating a player and letting them go 1 on 1. 

With Kevin durant the warriors have averaged more assists as a team in each of the past 3 years (regular season) than they have in the previous years including the 73-9 year where everything was about ball movement. ( leading to assists). 

In assists this year the rockets are 28th in the league while the warriors are #1. The warriors averaged 8.4 more assists. 
We all know that Houston's first scoring option was iso Harden, that alone explains their lack of assists. Shouldn't the warriors look like the rockets if kd was playing iso ball? Shouldn't their assists be much less than it was when they "" weren't going iso""?

The average passes per game for that 73-9 team was 323.5 passes per game. 
The 2014-2015 season team averaged 306.6 passes per game.

With KD
16-17 season : 317.7 passes per game
17-18 season : 322.7 passes per game
18-19 season : 320.1 passes per game

The Rockets would've won if Chris Paul had not Injured his hamstring was peddled and echoed throughout the Houston organisation for close to a year.

This year, the Warriors lost KD and Steph was playing with a hobbled middle finger (Noted Harden was suffering from an eye Injury too). However the Warriors weren't looking for excuses.

There are a plethora of such instances in the NBA folklore -

Jordan's flu game.

Dirk's flu game.

Kobe willing through a broken finger.

Dame personifies this virtue, he's honest and doesn't hide behind excuses. Even speaking about the final possession of Game 2 he said Iguodala jostled him before he went up to shoot, but stated that it was a clean strip and gave Iguodala credit for it (No - Bad Shot quotes).

There is a very interesting conversation between Daryl Morey and Bob Myers at the General Managers Open Court episode. 

Myers debates with Morey as to how a team cannot be quantified by numbers but also by the character and personality of the memebers of the squad. Morey vehemently objects to this notion.

Zion will make around 9 million so the total comes to around

**1st Scenario**

If Julius Randle chooses to accept his player option, then the Pelicans can use their 2020 pick to trade Solomon Hill, sheding 13 million dropping the total down to around 88,000,000

They can then use their 2022 pick to drop Etwan Moore, or hope to ship him out for a 2nd round pick on draft day and their cap would be around 80,000,000

They can finally decline Okafur's team option and they'll be at 79,000,000 dollars. Enough for one max player.

They can look at a guy like Jimmy Butler, Khris Middleton, Klay Thompson, or Kemba Walker to join them in NOLA. Lets say Jimmy Butler comes around, they can look to sign a guy like Darren Collison at the veteran minimum and roll out with a 2019-20 line up of 

Collison - Holiday - Butler - Zion - AD

Obviously weak at the PG, but Collison is a playoff veteran

the only valuable bench piece they'd have would be randle and they'd have to sign a bunch of veterans on minimum

**2nd Scenario**

Similar to the 1st scenario but doesnt involve them trading Moore as Julius Randle has decided to waive his player option opting to become a free agent.

**3rd Scenario**

Trade for Mike Conley they can dump the Moore + Hill contracts on memphis while throwing in those 2 picks and absorb Mike Conley's contract. He's still a viable 2 way player who would mesh very well with AD and Jrue

Look at his PPG and TS% averages. But that does not really tell the whole story. By its very nature the 3-point shot has massive variance. Even the greatest shooter of all time can go 0-10 from 3FG on a random game. Steph's game has massive variance just like the 3 point shot. One game he can score 50 with ease and the next he will struggle to score 15.

To illustrate the point compare him to another all time great offensive weapon who does not rely so much on the 3-point shot. Kevin Durant.

How many times did Steph score less then 20 points when he played 35 minutes in the playoffs since 2016?

9 Times. 9 times he failed to score 20 points. And many of those were massive Finals games.

Super stars. These are house hold names and most people around the world that know sports probably know who these people are and most in America could spot them and say who they are. Not based strictly on talent just but mainly fame and notoriety and talent

Harden

Russel Westbrook

Dame

Giannis

Kyrie

Luka

Embiid

Anthony Davis

Kawhi

Chris Paul

Honorable mentions for super star but I don’t believe are at the level even though almost all of basketball fans know them not everyone’s friends would know all of these players

Jokic

P. George

Blake griffin

Kemba

Simmons

Butler


I do find it interesting that the NBA has so many Superstar names that most people would know and I was wondering who y’all might consider too high on this list or just not listed at all. 

Teams left that we know have good players but no one of Major fame and their most famous player (probably)

Sac - buddy (college love)

Utah - spider

Spurs - Aldridge/derozan 

Clippers - Lou will

Suns - booker

Memphis - Conley

Min - KAT

East

Heat - ????

Ind - olidipo 

BKN - DLO

NYK - TBD in FA

Orlando - Augustine? Fultz?

Cle - Love

Atl - TY 

Wiz - wall

Chi - Lauri??? 


In conclusion it really shows to me how there is a major difference in power when it comes to super stars especially out west but the east even though it is technically the stronger market has less super stars. I had to struggle to find stars for some of the teams.

They weren't wrong.  Here are his scoring and shooting stats:
1st four games of Philly series:  22.3 fga, 8.8 fta, 38 pts.  
last four games of the playoffs:  25.3 fga, 9.5 fta, 30.5 pts.

One thing to note is that during that stretch, his steals per game went up from 0.8 to 2.3 without his personal fouls going up.  If he's putting more effort into defense and sacrificing his offense in doing so, I think that is a huge mistake for this team.  Then again, what do I know?  Their point differential has actually improved since Kawhi started being less efficient.  Their offense has been better overall, as well, but that is heavily boosted by one 125 point performance.  They haven't been able to score more than 101 points in their last three games.  That game 5 against Philly also has helped out their point differential quite a bit too, but I don't know if you can really throw out games as outliers with such a small sample size.  The last three games for this team have been really concerning, though.  The road loss to Philly in an elimination game, the home game that nearly went to overtime.  Then the collapse in game 1 of the ECF.  I don't think we will seeing a guy who can control both ends of the court this series.  I think his fatigue, and whatever else may be making him less efficient, will end the Raptors playoff run.

Very solid numbers. But not even close to the dominance he showed in the regular season. His TS% dropping from 64.4% to 58.0% is massive. His Assists/Turnover ratio is also disturbing.

But so far his teammates have been able to knock down shots so he has not had to force it too much. But what happens when his teammates start missing?

ESPN has obtained that info -- such as height, weight, wingspan and standing reach -- for some of the players projected to land in the lottery in June.

Here are our biggest takeaways, including physical comps and some record-setting numbers.

Note: We will continue to update this page with analysis on the combine measurements once the rest of the results are officially released.


Catch up on more of ESPN's draft combine analysis from Chicago here

• More top prospects than usual will not have their measurements taken at this year's combine. Zion Williamson, Ja Morant, RJ Barrett, and Darius Garland opted out of the proceedings, and Rui Hachimura, De'Andre Hunter and Matisse Thybulle are not in attendance at all. Even so, there's data available for all of these players from previous settings, and teams will not be fully in the dark even if these prospects do not come in for workouts.

• Tacko Fall may not be the highest-profile prospect at this year's combine, but he warrants special mention since he posted record-breaking numbers. The UCF standout measured 7-foot-7 in shoes (an inch taller than he was listed in college) with an 8-foot-2¼ wingspan and a 10-foot-2½ standing reach that exceed all officially recorded measurements. They are unofficially surpassed only by Manute Bol's alleged 8-foot-6 wingspan and 10-foot-5 standing reach of NBA lore. At this point in league history, there are not a lot of truly anomalous players from a physical perspective, but Fall certainly qualifies as such. Fall had a strong showing at the inaugural G League Elite Camp and was one of the 11 players who moved on to play at the NBA combine. He has a chance to continue to build on that momentum and potentially earn a spot in the second round (or, at minimum, a two-way contract).

Bol Bol measured impressively -- with similar dimensions to Rudy Gobert -- standing 7-2¼ in shoes with a 7-7 wingspan. However, Bol weighed in at 208 pounds, down considerably from the 234 pounds he weighed at the Nike Basketball Academy last August. Having fractured his foot in December, Bol likely hasn't been able to do much work in the weight room and quickly shed much of the bulk he put on in his time at Oregon, which isn't ideal considering he will be asked to bang with opposing centers in the NBA. Bol likely will never be especially bulky and he is able to rely less heavily on physicality than most big men with his unique scoring touch. But his ability to find a comfortable playing weight that will allow him to hold his own defensively is a point of interest among teams.

• Cam Reddish lived up to expectations and compared favorable to fellow one-and-done prospects such as Jayson Tatum, Andrew Wiggins, and Kevin Knox in the measurements -- standing 6-8 in shoes with a 208-pound frame and a 7-0½ wingspan. Talent has never been the issue with the Duke freshman, and his measurements were well known after he made the rounds in various camps from an early age. But it's a positive for him to remind teams of his unique physical tools. He could be a riser in the pre-draft process as the memory of his disappointing season fades over time, replaced by these kinds of data points and strong pre-draft workouts.

• In contrast, Jarrett Culver exceeded the previous consensus among teams regarding his measurables. He's grown since last year, now standing 6-6¾ with a 6-9½ wingspan and a lean 194-pound frame. That puts the Texas Tech standout in the same class as especially big guards such as Caris LeVert, and he compares favorably to others such as Spencer Dinwiddie and D'Angelo Russell in terms of height and reach. Culver's ability to handle the ball and be a playmaker at that size is unique. It gives him nice upside to grow into as his body fills out and his perimeter shot stabilizes.

• Romeo Langford and Kevin Porter Jr. both posted prototypical numbers for their positions, as expected, with an identical 8-7 standing reach. Porter is marginally smaller than Langford standing 6-5½ in shoes, but his 213-pound frame and 6-10 wingspan falls somewhere between Victor Oladipo and James Harden on the spectrum of strong guards. Langford measured 6-6 in shoes with a 6-11 wingspan that gives him similar dimensions to Jason Richardson and Bogdan Bogdanovic

• Nassir Little measured 6-6 in shoes. His 7-1¼ wingspan and 224-pound frame place him somewhere between Jaylen Brown and Kawhi Leonard in terms of physical comps. Little's length and bulk should allow him to play the power forward position in the NBA with relative ease.

• Jaxson Hayes's physical comparisons are just as impressive as his 6-11½, 219-pound frame and 7-3½ wingspan -- falling somewhere between Tyson Chandler and Clint Capela.

• Brandon Clarke recorded perhaps the most interesting measurements of any player tested this week, given that this is the first time teams are getting their eyes on his official numbers. Standing only 6-8¼ in shoes with an even 6-8¼ wingspan and a 207-pound frame, Clarke has similar dimensions to wing players such as Gordon Hayward, Klay Thompson and Rodney Hood. But that did not stop him from blocking an astonishing 4.3 shots per 40 minutes at Gonzaga last season. His 8-6 standing reach may not fall in step with other comparably versatile defensive forwards such as Draymond Green (8-9) or LeBron James (8-10¼), but it is far from a deal breaker given the potential he showed last season while protecting the rim and locking down several NBA-level guards off of switches.

Finding a real NBA comp for Clarke's measurements -- especially someone who also plays center minutes -- is challenging. The closest ones we can find are DeMarre Carroll (6-7¾, 207 pounds, 6-10 wingspan) and Andre Roberson (6-7, 206 pounds, 6-11 wingspan), and even those aren't exact matches due to their superior length.

• Coby White is another interesting case, as he measured out extremely tall (6-4¾ in shoes) but doesn't have great length (6-5 wingspan, 8-1½ standing reach). His physical comps are nevertheless excellent, partially due to his improved frame (191 pounds), as the likes of Kyrie Irving, CJ McCollum and Malik Beasley have similar dimensions to him.

Kawhi had only 2 assists and 3 turnovers, even though he faced a ton of double teams. Simply stated Kawhi could not find the open man enough or he was unable to make the pass on time. Either way the Bucks were able to double Kawhi at will because of Kawhi's lack of playmaking.

For his playoff career Kawhi is averaging 2.1 assists and 1.7 turnovers a game. That is horrible. This year he's at 3.5 assists and 3.1 turnovers a game. Having your #1 option having a 1 to 1 assist to turnover ration is very bad.

Because of his lack of passing vision Kawhi forces way too many shots. We saw it again last night. He went 10/26. This was after he went 16/39 against the 76ers in Game 7. Thats 40% FG the last 2 games. 

I think this lack of playmaking is a massive weakness that will cost the Raptors the series and keeps Kawhi from being the best player in the world.

As someone who has spoken a lot about the draft system, daring the NBA to do something, I am pleased with the system. I do admit not liking Lakers at four, but I don't see a rig or whatever.
 
  But I am just so tired of seeing fans no accuse Lakers and Pelicans of tanking and then now have the audacity to think they are more entitled. 

  This is the problem with fans, they want things Easy and that the worst teams deserve more than 30 to 35 win teams. Why the hell is that really fair? You can criticize this system but you can't play victim and say the Suns deserved another first pick after winning like below 25 games for years and the Sixers who win literally 18,17, and 10 games in three consecutive years. People keep defending this shit, but this is what the NBA wanted to stop and it should be. Winning those amount of games should not be heavily rewarded at all and tired of this mentality. 
  
  I'm not saying tanking will be done and should be stopped. I agree we can see late season tanking but I don't think this will hurt the league at all. The bottom line the draft is really a crapshot like a normal draft is and it will make teams earn their success. I don't get why people don't grasp this. Fans should also actually be grateful any of the worst teams can still get the chance to get talent. You don't get this outside of America. Fans just got to understand owners, fans like me, and players just don't want to worry about bottoming out to just give their teams hope. They just have to work harder on the court and within each organization. I know it can be tough as some FO's suck, but that is up to them. There will always be MJ, Lebron's, and KD's in the top five but looking at history and research there are Curry's Drexler's Malone's, Stockton's, Giannis's, and even Kobe in the lottery after the top five and even later.

My reasoning for this is:
- The Pelicans currently have two All-Stars in their prime. It's much easier that you trade for a third star, than embrace the rebuild and blow it all up.
- David Griffin, the Pels new VP, is no stranger to trading top picks after doing the same thing in Cleveland in 2014. Obviously Wiggins isn't of the same level as Zion, however it's still similar intentions of building a win now squad.
- With Durant going East, the West is as wide open next season as it has been in years. There's a real chance they make the finals if they can add a star alongside Jrue and Davis.

Now, the obvious con to this plan (outside of Davis likely wanting to leave regardless), is that Zion has almost untouchable level talent. It really depends on the return you'd get for him.

This next part might be where some people particularly disagree with me...and I want to preface this by saying HEAR ME OUT!

You offer Zion to the Lakers for LeBron James. Who says no?
Lakers already have a young core, adding Zion and whoever they take 4 gives them a really solid young core. Yes, it sets them back a step in terms of their team competing, but they also get one of the best talents in years to keep them happy.
As for the Pels, well they get LeBron James.

They took 7 games to beat a Sixers team that was a great matchup for us and who many had us beating easily. The Bucks, meanwhile, remain dominant as ever, dispatching the dysfunctional Celtics in 5 games. Even the most optimistic of predictions have the Raps taking 6-7 games to win this series. Let's take a look at what Toronto can do to even these odds.

##Zone defense

For the most part, zone defense remains nonexistent in today's NBA. Even when it yields excellent results in small samples during the regular season, teams don't bring it out in the playoffs at all. However, the Raptors are uniquely positioned to utilize zone defense in the ECF thanks to their defensive personnel and excellent communication.

We've seen Toronto bring out a zone defense for extremely short spurts during the regular season with insanely high success. We normally run a 1-2-2 defense, which [is slightly different](https://imgur.com/a/BEdCq3h) from a 3-2 zone. In our zone, we have Pascal Siakam at the top of the key as the 'rover'. He is very quick and has great length, and can disrupt other teams' offense very effectively. In addition, Siakam being at the top of the key allows him to get down the court even quicker in transition, where he shines the brightest. On the wings, we will have our starting backcourt of Kyle Lowry and Danny Green. Both of these guys are able to collapse and provide scrappy help defense in the paint on Giannis' drives, but are also quick enough to recover to the 3-point line if he decides to kick the ball out to one of Milwaukee's excellent shooters. Our 'posts' will most likely be Kawhi and Ibaka/Gasol; they must be physical enough to contest shots inside the key while also being mobile enough to slide over and contest corner 3s, and rebound well.

Even though Toronto usually runs a 1-2-2 zone, I'd actually rather see us use a 3-2 zone if we bring it out this series; as indicated in the previous graphic, the 3-2 zone has the rover sag off a little off the ball-handler but allows the two wings to press up more on the perimeter. This is better against a team like the Bucks; it would be wiser to sag off Giannis and prevent their great shooters from getting open looks than play up on Giannis and leave their other guys open.

The zone defense shouldn't be our BIGGEST focus defensively. Our defensive strategy should still primarily be man-to-man defense. The 3-2 zone should be a change-of-pace strategy that catches the Bucks off guard and allows us to go on a run. In a 7 game series where every possession matters and games are heavily affected by scoring runs, that could be enough to sway the series in our favor.

We've seen zone defense come up huge in the playoffs before. The Mavericks were able to smother LeBron in 2011 and win the Finals thanks to their 2-3 zone defense, a scheme that focuses even more on packing the paint as it assigns one defender specifically to camping in the paint. However, the 2-3 is far worse at guarding the perimeter and more prone to giving up 3-second violations in the paint, while the 3-2 has 5 defenders on the perimeter and collapsing when someone drives.

##Man defense

Kawhi is still the best wing defender in the league, but guarding a rested Giannis over a 7 game series will physically wear him down and affect his ability to carry our offense. More importantly, having him on Giannis full-time will indubitably lead to our best player ending up in foul trouble at some point. We should have Pascal on Giannis and let Kawhi handle their other star in Middleton. The Bucks defense takes away a lot of Siakam's strengths on offense anyways, so he'll be able to expend a lot more energy defensively using his length and mobility guarding Giannis. After seeing how well Horford did on Giannis in Game 1 of the semis, I'd love to see Gasol on Giannis too.

We shouldn't have just one defender on Giannis the whole time. Ideally, we'll rotate between Siakam, Ibaka, and Gasol. We want to keep throwing different looks at Giannis and prevent him from getting comfortable. Also, we don't want any one player getting into serious foul trouble.

**Don't switch off Giannis !**
In Game 1 vs. Boston, Giannis kept trying to attack the Celtics half court defense straight on with no success, as Horford did a great job of containing him. In Game 2, Milwaukee did a lot better setting up Giannis through screens, and he feasted on a scrambled Celtics defense and anyone not named Horford.

I'm really worried about Lowry in this series. He has struggled massively against Bledsoe and Hill historically. This sounds crazy, but if things REALLY go downhill for him defensively, we could experiment and hide him on one of Milwaukee's spot up shooters like Mirotic and slide everyone else down (Gasol guards Giannis, Kawhi stays on Middleton, Siakam and Green guard their backcourt).

##Offense

**Get Gasol involved !**

I've been saying this since last round. We've been underutilizing Marc Gasol so much. Back in Memphis he was the man, and he's shown that he can be the focal point of an offense. Obviously, he can't do that much with Kawhi and Siakam on his team, but last series he was too passive. He didn't look for his own shot at all, and it was frustrating watching him pass out of everything, even open shots. In the first two rounds, he was busy shutting down Embiid and Vuc on the defensive end; now, with no elite center for him to focus on, he'll be able to expend a lot more energy on the offensive end. Earlier this year on the Grizzlies, he put up an efficient 29 points while dragging a struggling Memphis team to a win over Milwaukee. Gasol needs more touches and should be more aggressive looking for his shot.

**Run Brook Lopez off the floor**

Brook has been great this year for Milwaukee. He's been amazing shooting the 3 ball, and is no slouch on interior defense either. However, he is extremely slow footed and we should be targeting him on defense a lot. (Nick Nurse did NOTHING to target JJ Redick in Round 2, so I don't expect much this time around.) We should be forcing Lopez into tons of PnPs and make him have to keep up with one of our quicker players driving to the rim. If we can keep Lopez off the floor, Giannis won't have as much spacing on the other end and we can play more aggressive help defense on his drives.

**Pascal Siakam and the Draymond treatment**

Last series, Philly effectively limited Siakam by switching Embiid onto him and letting him sag off Siakam, giving up off-the-dribble 3s. Siakam couldn't punish this defense and bricked almost every open look he got. If the Bucks do something similar, I don't want to have Siakam continue to do what he did against Philly. If Milwaukee ends up giving him the ""Draymond Green treatment"", I want Siakam to do the same thing Draymond does to counter that sort of defensive strategy. One thing Draymond does when he's left wide open: he passes to Curry or Thompson and immediately sprints to them to set an on-ball screen. Since Dray's defender is so deep, this leaves the Warriors in a 2-on-1 situation with Dray screening for arguably the 2 greatest shooters ever. We don't have anywhere near that type of shooting, but Lowry and Kawhi are more than good enough to execute this counter to sagging off Siakam.

Outside of Giannis, the Bucks individually don't have anyone near Joel Embiid's caliber of protecting the paint, so Siakam could alternatively just try to drive into the paint anyways, but I strongly advise against trying to do this against a team that defends inside like Milwaukee.

**Exploiting Coach Bud's defense**

The Bucks' defense focuses almost entirely on packing the paint and stopping corner 3s while giving up open 3s at the top of the key and midrange shots. Kawhi is going to feast against this defense. We should run a TON of PnP with Marc Gasol. In the half court, Siakam almost exclusively scores from the corner and in the paint, so I don't expect too much out of him offensively. The Bucks typically have their bigs drop back and protect the paint on picks, so we should have Ibaka and Gasol looking to shoot off PnPs at the top of the key and in the midrange.

But every one of these players except KD has a big weakness.

1. Lebron - Defense and Free throw shooting. Sorry but those are massive weaknesses. If you only can play solid defense for 5 minutes a game you are not the best. Now throw in his 67% FT rate and endgame situations are dicey.

2. Steph - Defense and physicality. Its no mystery that Steph can be neutralized when physical play is allowed. He is also very small and can be pick on on defense. Steph plays hard on defense, but physical limitations are physical limitations.

3. Giannis. Jump shot. Pure and simple. Outside of the restricted area Giannis is shooting about 31% FG for the year. That is a huge weakness that damages a teams spacing.

4. Harden. Endurance and Foul reliance. We've seen Harden burnout in the playoffs year after year. Plus so much of his offense relies on drawing fouls. His endurance also makes his average defense turn into well below average defense.

5. Kawhi. Playmaking. He simply does not make other players better on offense. Simply does not. He average 3 assists and 2 turnovers a game this year. In the playoffs its 3.6 assists and 3.1 turnovers. He is late in making passes. He does not handle double teams well and is not a natural playmaker. 

6. KD. What is KD's weakness? He is an excellent defender. Can guard all 5 positions. He is a great shooter at all 4 levels ( 3 range, mid range, at the rim, free throw line) can take physical punishment, has great endurance, and is a very good playmaker ( 6 assists per game and 3 turnovers).

With that said, why reward bad teams for being bad? Teams that at least are closer to contention should get a chance to try to make the playoffs.

Also, this is a bit rambly and I’m sorry. Hopefully my point comes across.

I was listening to the Bill Simmons podcast when Bill pointed this out: https://overcast.fm/+Jm8dk479U/19:06

Basically, the TWolves have been in the lottery 21 out of the last 30 years, but have won exactly 2 playoff series (both in 2004). They only made the playoffs once since then, losing in the first round.

That got me thinking about rewarding bad teams in general. Despite how much people say “high lottery picks are the only way to be competitive”, and that it’s unfair to not give bad teams a chance, I don’t really know if it’s fair to reward extended periods of being bad with a constant stream of lottery picks with the hope they get better.

It is true that the best players typically come from the lottery, but we’ve seen over and over again teams botch picks and suck for years at a time.

The kings haven’t made the playoffs since 2006, and have been in the lottery every year since then. Phoenix haven’t made the playoffs since 2010. The Hornets have made the lottery or lost in the first round every year since 2005. The Pelicans got Anthony Davis and won exactly 1 playoff series in the seven years since. Even the lakers have been garbage since 2014 and have almost nothing to show for it outside of LeBron (who they didn’t even draft).

When you look at teams with sustained success right now, most of them have barely been in the lottery. The warriors only really got Curry and Klay as meaningful contributors from lottery picks (and had a stretch of 17 years of mediocrity before they got good, with 15 lottery appearances), while they were just smart with the rest of their team building. The rockets have only had 1 losing season since 2003, while the trailblazers only missed the playoffs *8 times in the last 42 years*. The spurs obviously haven’t missed he playoffs since Tom Duncan, and even after he retired they’ve been competitive. Even the Nuggets are only good now because they lucked out on Jokic in the second round, not because of any high lottery picks they got.

The point is, teams don’t just get good because they draft a good player, and giving bad teams lottery picks feels more like a waste of talent than anything else to me. If you actually want to help teams get better, you need to have a smart front office and good coaching. You could go so far as to argue that if you actually want to help teams improve and be competitive, you should instill a maximum number of consecutive losing seasons for GMs (or presidents or owners or something) before they’re fired rule. 

That’s not to say high lottery picks don’t help (see: Thunder, 76ers, 2003 Cavs), but that it’s not going to help with anything unless you have a smart organization managing those picks (and the rest of the team). 

All of this is to say that these odds are better because it potentially rewards middle-of-the road lottery teams that are arguably closer to contention than the worst teams. They should get better talent to propel themselves into he playoff race and make the league more competitive, rather than bad teams being given chance after chance while they stay bad.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,36049,public,self,Why the new lottery odds are way better,0,1558057596,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/bp0o4a/why_the_new_lottery_odds_are_way_better/,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'mfC4u8Z8GS_NflDfgoTrnxlYjBLzPX_fQO34dLSMMpU', 'resolutions': [{'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/LT7k1bUl9e3OkQOh5NcicXarz3QirJZCrz1uLd7uPs4.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e007f723a56552428d5b26e7572df8727047225', 'width': 108}, {'height': 216, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/LT7k1bUl9e3OkQOh5NcicXarz3QirJZCrz1uLd7uPs4.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1e44bf52a65b6ce0af3cd38de784fee8ee55a6a', 'width': 216}, {'height': 320, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/LT7k1bUl9e3OkQOh5NcicXarz3QirJZCrz1uLd7uPs4.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53db0e34b60901ec2e254939e600c7557d579724', 'width': 320}, {'height': 640, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/LT7k1bUl9e3OkQOh5NcicXarz3QirJZCrz1uLd7uPs4.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b0b1b2cb26fe53fc98d39050a71f81007a52d80', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 840, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/LT7k1bUl9e3OkQOh5NcicXarz3QirJZCrz1uLd7uPs4.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=1bed012ed18f514f651845a6a1f209825742fd53', 'width': 840}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,

Some quotes below

Protecting the rim without a shot blocker

Simultaneously forcing turnovers and suppressing two-point field goal percentage is a tricky thing to do. The sorts of things that teams do to force turnovers, such as playing in the passing lanes looking for deflections, often expose them at the rim. Florida has somehow achieved what it has carrying an extra handicap: the Gators lack a traditional rim-defending center. Donovan's squad only sends away 8.2 percent of opponent twos, a rate that lies below the NCAA median of 9.5.

Teams that lack a great shot blocker can compensate by constructing their defense to limit chances to get to the rim. Florida does this as well as any team in the country. Only 29 percent of opponent attempts come at the rim against the Gator ""D,"" per hoop-math.com. This is the 28th-lowest rate in D-I. Florida opponents convert shots at the rim 59 percent of the time, which is approximately the D-I median. Florida can't do anything special to stop you once you get to the hoop, so the best approach is to not let you get there in the first place.

The thing that makes the Florida defense so interesting is that it layers an aggressive full court press on top of a conservative approach in the half court. It is an effective combination that allows the Gators to simultaneously protect the basket while also forcing turnovers.

There is a certain logic to the Florida approach. Players can take chances 94 feet from their own basket and still recover, but if you gamble for a steal in the half court and miss, an easy layup is a common result. It is similar to a football team that blitzes the opposing quarterback 80 yards from the goal line, but then becomes much more conservative when backed up against its own end zone.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,36046,public,self,"Donovan in college went center-less so he could run the famous press defense and traps.

For the sake of simplicity let's assume that the top 5 in the West - Warriors, Nuggets, Rockets, Blazers, Jazz - are virtually certain to remain playoff teams next year.

Let's also assume that the Doc coached Clippers, that took the Warriors to 6, with their 2 promising starter level rookies, deep bench, and 2 maxes worth of cap space will also be a playoff team next year.

That leaves 2 playoff spots between:

* **Spurs** - a Pop coached team with a promising Derrick White and a returning Dejounte Murray
* **Kings** - the team that came closest to a playoff berth this year, has a solid young core, and a max worth of cap space
* **Lakers** -  a team with Lebron, a max worth of cap space, the #4 pick, and a grab bag of decent-to-good young players
*  **Mavs** - a Carlisle coached team with the most talented rookie in memory, a returning 7'3 all-star, and a max worth of cap space
* **Pels** - Jrue, and AD or AD-worth of players, and Zion 

and the **Thunder** which have a superstar on a decline that hasn't been able to crack 50 wins in recent years, no positive trade assets, no tradeable picks until 2024, and not a dollar of capspace

As any GM should be a numbers guy, they would have be extremely wary of their odds of being one of the 2 out of the 6 that comes out of this group - Spurs and Thunder look like the most likely to make way but the Thunder have *nothing* as a potential positive improvement going into the summer.

NOLA - Zion Williamson  
This is a given, best prospect and gives them a new franchise player to build around as they seek a trade partner for Anthony Davis. Expect them to field offers from the Knicks, Lakers, Celtics and maybe a dark horse team for AD so they can acquire more assets. 
2. Memphis - Ja Morant  
They found their successor to Mike Conley. The Russell Westbrook like point guard will create a dynamic athletic duo with Jaren Jackson Jr. Expect Mike Conley to either mentor or be traded to Utah, Toronto, or Indiana as they hand over the key to Ja
3. New York - RJ Barrett  
Probably the most complete scorer in the draft with playmaking and has good defensive upside. He fits in the SG/SF role which is a need for the team. If the Knicks do land Kevin Durant/Kyrie?Kemba, he'll slot in nicely at the 3, being the 3/4th option and gaining valuable experience.
4. Lakers - Jarrett Culver  
I dont think he'll be on the Lakers, they'll draft him but include him in a trade to try and get AD. But hes a good two way player that plays within himself. Very skilled but not very explosive.
5. Cleveland - DeAndre Hunter  
Very good defensive wing that can stretch the floor. His big issue is that he hides on offense a bit. With the Cavs rebuilding for the next few years, he's going to have plenty of opportunities to break out of that offensive shell
6. Phoenix - Darius Garland  
They wanted Ja but will have to settle for Garland. In his limited time playing he showed very good shooting and playmaking ability.
7. Chicago - Coby White  
Hes going to be the surprise talent here. Bulls will probably look for a younger alternative to Dunn, and Coby is it. He a big body at 6'5 who can play both guard positions. Hes blazing fast and has good playmaking ability. Him and Zach will create a dynamic backcourt
8. Atlanta - Cameron Reddish  
This is actually a pretty good fit. Reddish is a projected good long range shooter thats long enough to play solid defense. Him + the Young/Kevin back court will be a dangerous shooting trio.
9. Wizards - Jaxson Hayes  
The Wizards biggest flaw is their lack of a big man. Hayes fits that role very well. At 6'11 with a 7'4 wingspan he projects to be a strong rim protector
10. Atlanta - Sekou Doumbouya  
This guy is a project and Atlanta should take the risk. He can play the 3 and the 4 and play a back up role. His main strength right now is his defense and athleticism but he has good two way potential
11. T'Wolves - Brandon Clarke  
Kat doesnt play good defense, Wiggins doesnt play good defense, but Brandon Clarke does. If you insert him in a line up with Josh, they can cover alot of the teams defensive issues. 
12. Hornets - Kevin Porter Jr  
None of the prospects from this point show extremely great promise. Kevin Porter is a risky pick since he wasnt able to play much after his suspension but he is know to be a big scorer. If kemba decides to stay, Porter can develop (Hopefully) into a guy who can take some of that scoring burden
13. Miami Heat - Romeo Langford  
Basically the BPA at this point. Romeo is explosive with a 7 foot wingspan. He can score pretty well but his handle is hot garbage.

SB = Step Back, NSB = Non-Step Back, %Diff = 3PT SB% - 3PT NSB%, %SB = Percentage of SB 3PT attempts vs 3PT attempts

Of all of these players, only Lillard had a lower SB 3PT percentage than his NSB 3PT percentage, but it was only .5% lower. Every other player had a better percentage for SB 3PT than NSB 3PT. The most notable improvements are Stephen Curry and Lebron James. Curry who is already a lethal 3PT shooter improved to 60.3% on SB 3PT from 42.2% on NSB 3PT, an 18% improvement. Lebron improved to 48% on SB 3PT from 31.4% on NSB 3PT, a 17% improvement. The average improvement from NSB to SB was 6.38%.

The only two players taking advantage of this is Harden who shot 53% of his 3PT as SB and Doncic who shot 32% of his 3PT as SB. I think many of these players could improve their efficiency from 3 by taking more step back 3PT shots like Harden did this past season.

In thinking about the action of taking a SB 3PT, I would have guessed that adding the motion of taking a step back before taking a three would negate the benefit of additional space, but I guess the step back motion doesn't bother many of these players.

Who do you think will copy Harden and take more SB 3PT next season and why do you think the SB helps these 3PT shooters?

This one is obvious. He's a guy who plays above the rim but he's also 285 pounds. That the constant flying he does to dunk the ball must be torture for his knees.

**Undersized**

He's a 6'7 power forward. Not laterally quick enough to guard the perimeter full time, too small to guard much much taller defenders. Put him at the 3, his lateral quickness becomes an issue. Put him at the 4, he doesn't shoot well so he can't stretch the floor causing a bit of a jam in the middle if your center can't shoot. Put him at the 5 and he'll most like be 3-6 inches shorter than the average center. And before anyone brings up the Draymond Green comparison saying that he's 6'7 and can play the 3,4,5 effectively, Green at his best is a great passer, shot 38% from 3 and played DPOY defense.

**Shooting ability**

He shot 33% from 3 and 64 % from the free throw line. He'll most likely be a below average shooter in the NBA as free throw shooting is a good indication of NBA shooting. Teams can exploit that depending on the match ups. I don't expect him to be Ben Simmons bad, but it'll be similar to any struggles that Giannis faces.

**Best moves are post moves**

Zions best moves are post hooks and post spins. In college it works because he's able to bully guys around him. But now that the NBA has guys as big or stronger than him, will it still work? Also having your best skills being your post ability at 6'7 isn't that great.

But at this point, I think a trade of Ingram + kuzma + the 4th pick could be enough to get AD given the fact that the Pelicans got that first pick. If they had even gotten the second pick I wouldn't really consider this as much.

But now they (likely) get Zion (who is an amazing prospect but not a guarantee like I see many people saying he is (personal opinion)).

I think the Pelicans keep Jrue and try to build around a young core like this. Shams has said that AD still intends to leave so I imagine he's still forcing his way out which means this offseason is going to be the best value for him.

With it looking like Kyrie might not stay in Boston, does this potentially mean Tatum wouldn't be traded thereby not really giving many other teams a chance in the AD sweepstakes aside from the Lakers. 

This is really where I'd like any input, who else do you think competes to get an almost guaranteed HOFer like AD for a rental year.

This is based on a few assumptions.

* Anthony Davis still wants to be traded.
* The Lakers are still interested in Anthony Davis.
* Zion Williamson does not want to play for the Pelicans (which was quite - in my opinion - from his attitude post-lottery)
* The New York Knicks are still interested in Zion Williamson

In my mind, this could lead to the following trades taking place:
* Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma and a future first-round pick for Anthony Davis (NOP).
* The 3rd pick, Dennis Smith and Mitchell Robinson for the 1st pick (NOP).

This would lead to the Pelicans having the following players heading into next season (current team in brackets):

* Jrue Holiday (NOP)
* Solomon Hill (NOP)
* E’Twaun Moore (NOP)
* Stanley Johnson (NOP) - *Restricted FA, resigned*
* Jahlil Okafor (NOP)
* Kenrich Williams (NOP)
* Dairis Bertans (NOP)
* Lonzo Ball (LAL)
* Josh Hart (LAL)
* Brandon Ingram (LAL)
* Kyle Kuzma (LAL)
* Mitchell Robinson (NY)
* Dennis Smith (NY)

The roster would be rounded out by RJ Barrett (assuming Williamson goes #1 and Morant goes #2) and a third-string centre (signed in free agency).

This would lead to the following depth chart heading into 2019-20:

C: Jahlil Okafor - Mitchell Robinson - FA Centre
PF: Kyle Kuzma - Stanley Johnson - Kenrich Williams
SF: Brandon Ingram - RJ Barrett - Solomon Hill
SG: Jrue Holiday - Josh Hart - Dairis Bertans
PG: Dennis Smith - Lonzo Ball - E’Twaun Moore

Of course, this is the best case scenario, so there are some issues.

* Will Stanley Johnson resign for a reasonable amount?  I already assumed Julius Randle is gone due to an offer in FA, but Johnson is only a restricted FA.  Despite this, I could see the Pelicans letting him go if a team offers him 8 figures.
* Did I assume the Knicks will give up too many assets?  Obviously, Williamson has an incredible amount of hype, but Barrett is also a highly touted prospect.  Even if Williamson is an upgrade, would they give up that much to move up to get him?
* Would the new players kick up a similar fuss?  Obviously, nothing guarantees the new players will have different sentiments towards the franchise.  Despite this, they lack the same bargaining power as a legitimate superstar and a player with the level of hype that Zion possesses.

When simulating this trade it is rejected under the current rules [http://tradenba.com/trades/rJGUsethV](http://tradenba.com/trades/rJGUsethV)

&amp;#x200B;

Is there something I am missing that would allow them to make this trade possible? With the current state of the nba I feel like it is more likely that NY, Boston, and Houston will be the main candidates for an AD trade. Houston is a bit of a reach but they just lost potentially their best chance at beating the Warriors and have shown they are willing to go all in with the Butler trade rumours earlier this season.

&amp;#x200B;

The way I see it is:

&amp;#x200B;

NY can offer 3rd pick (RJ?)+DSJ+filler+picks

&amp;#x200B;

Boston can offer Tatum+filler+picks

&amp;#x200B;

Houston can offer Capela+PJ/Gordon+multiple firsts

&amp;#x200B;

and then my hot take prediction is if toronto loses to the bucks or warriors and Kawhi still stays, they can Lowry+gasol with OG/Vanvleet for Jrue and AD lol

They traded Kristaps Porzingis to open cap space to sign two max-contracts, and also are looking to trade the 1st pick for AD if possible. 

With that being said, I think it's a bad plan. They don't have a core of players that can be good role players alongside those stars, and the coaching staff is still unproven.

Right now, their core is pretty young. The only guy I can see contributing in an efficient way for next season is Mitchell Robinson. Knox has potential but his rookie season was not great, and this franchise turn could be bad for his development. DSJ is inconsistent and still needs time to prove himself. 

So, I started to think: has any team that was in the Knicks situation executed this plan well? I can't think of any. The criteria would be:

- Awful roster 
- Unproven coaching 
- 2 major signings in the same offseason 
- Playoffs success in the near future

2011 - Had to face Dirk on a mission in the WCF. No one was beating Dirk that year. 

2012 - Had to face an absolute blood bath in the West. Had to face the last 3 champions. Dirk's Mavs, Kobe's Lakers, and Duncan's Spurs. Then to top it off he had to face Lebron in his absolute prime in the Finals. No one was beating Lebron in 2012.

So 2 years in a row KD had to face an All Time Great player at their absolute peak of HUNGER and PRIME. No one was denying Dirk and Lebron. That type of hunger comes from a decade of failure. 

2013 - Trading James Harden. Super unlucky. Still OKC had the best team in the league. But Westbrook gets taken out on an absolute cheap shot. Season over.

2014 - Here we go again. The 2014 Spurs were a team on an absolute mission after the heart break in the previous Finals. Still KD pushed that Spur team to Game 6 overtime. In contrast Lebron got absolutely destroyed in 5 in the Finals. How is KD keep running into these teams/players who are on holy Crusades?

2015 - KD destroys his foot

2016 - Thunder dominate an amazing 67-win Spur team. This was Kawhi at his absolute physical peak. But unluckily he had to face a 73-win team right after. Thunder push that to 7 games but far short. No team in NBA history has ever beaten two 65+ win teams in a single playoff run. And that is what KD had to do. Against literally 2 of the best regular season teams of all time.

As you can see KD was extremely UNLUCKY. 

He had to face 2 guys that were on absolutely DESPERATE and HUNGRY missions to win (Dirk and Lebron). Then 2 years of devastating injury. Then he had to face a Team on a HOLY CRUSADE (Spurs) and then face TWO historic teams back to back. Now throw in the James Harden trade.

However, people failed to look into who would be getting those shots and what type of offense they'd run. Here's some Synergy data of players on OKC doing a variety of play types.

PNR Ball handler:

PG: 1.02 PPP

Dennis: 0.81 PPP

Russ: 0.78 PPP

Ferguson: 0.42 PPP

Isolation:

Paul George: .92 PPP

Russell Westbrook: .86 PPP

Dennis: .75 PPP

Grant: .57 PPP

Off-screen:

PG: 1.10 PPP

Ferg: 0.66 PPP

Where is the extra offense supposed to go? OKC does not have players who can efficiently create their own shot other than PG. They don't have players who can carry this extra load. Dennis is barely a better PNR scorer and worse isolation player than Russ, does it really make sense to give him 5-10 extra scoring touches? Grant and Ferguson are awful creators, substantially worse than Russ, it makes no sense to give them his creating touches.

Every potent offense in the NBA has an identity in their offensive system. GSW has a bunch of awful screens, actions, and cuts. Denver runs a bunch of PNRs and DHOs involving Jokic. Houston runs a bunch of PNR involving Harden, CP3, and Gordon. People constantly say that OKC needs to install and offensive system, but how can you install an offensive system like GSW if only one guy can run off screens? How can you install a system like Houston or Denver if once again, only one guy can efficiently run the PNR? You can't just force feed PG the ball. That becomes incredibly predictable and since he's a wing, its much easier to deny him the ball. You can give Harden or Dame 30 scoring touches because they bring the ball up the floor and are best in the high PNR. You can't do that with PG because he's best running off screens, off the catch isos, and post ups. Teams can easily deny and trap PG in these scenarios as showcased in Game 5 vs Portland.

The reason why Russ has the ball so much is because OKC is best when he drives and kicks to shooters. Here's the spot up synergy numbers:

Spot Up:

Paul George: 1.27 PPP

Dennis: 1.06 PPP

Grant: 1.05 PPP

Ferguson: 1.04 PPP

All above 50th percentile

Clearly, OKC is best when Russ draws the defense and kicks it out. The issue with that is that teams realize this and just give Russ the open jump shot. Russ can't just barrell straight into the defense laying five feet off of him, he'll turn the ball over.

I'm not shielding Russ from blame here btw. I'm saying he's being blamed for the wrong reasons. The issue with OKC and Russ is not that he shoots too much, its that they're paying him a super max to not be able to hit open jump shots and score efficiently. If you look at every elite offense in the NBA, they have efficient players running the offense and taking the shots. Russ was not one of those players and if you're paying him the supermax - he has to be. They have no other viable options.They would not have been better off with him shooting less and deferring to Dennis and Ferguson.

I think SGA has a real chance of taking it to the next level.  The playoff run against GSW should give him a ton of confidence.

%Diff is the difference between the eFG% of the shot type and Harden's total eFG%

&amp;#x200B;

In the 2018-19 season, Harden was very efficient with his shot selection where over 96% of his shots had an eFG% of higher than 50%. I think the biggest highlight of his efficiency was the incredible number of step back 3PT shots he took and made this season. He made took more step back 3's than any other shot type and made them at 39% which is significantly better than his non-stepback 3 percentage of 34%.

The only two ineffective shot categories for Harden was the 2PT Jump Shot and 2PT Step Back Jump Shot (midrange shots), but this only accounts for less than 4% of his shots. It's somewhat surprising that his step back 2 was his worst shot type and the step back 3PT was his best shot type, but maybe this is just additional proof of Moreyball.

Harden always seems to improve his game year to year when it seems no longer possible to improve. This year he added the step back 3PT shot (39% on 542 attempts) and the floater (52% on 225 attempts). Next year, one shot type that Harden could potentially add to improve his game is the midrange fadeaway shot. This season he was 62% on those fadeaway shots but only took 21 of them. Another way he could improve is by improving his step back 2's and taking even more step back 3's. Overall Harden is already incredibly efficient with his shot selection, so it will be exciting to see what else he adds to his game next year.

As a Raptors fan, I wanted to get the input of the users of this sub. Having gone through the Philly series, one thing that was evident to me was the shortened rotations from both teams, even as compared to the first round of the playoffs. The starters on both sides were all on the court for at least 36 minutes a night, and in some cases over 40 mins, such as what happened in Game 7.

This made the Sixers a really tough matchup as the biggest weakness Philly seemingly had going into round 2 was a severe lack of bench depth. This problem obviously becomes less of an issue if both teams are playing their starters for incredible stretches. What is funny to me though is that while it seemed like the Raptors bench would be leaps and bounds better than Philly’s on paper, the opposite occurred and FVV sucked and Ibaka was streaky, whereas Ennis and Scott we’re giving us fits.

Looking ahead to the matchup with the Bucks, I can’t help but feel like their starting lineup is as intimidating as Philly’s. The Sixers had 4 bonafide studs who all play at an All-Star level and JJ Reddick who is one of the NBAs premiere marksman. To me, the Bucks don’t really have that sort of firepower in the starting lineup. Outside of Giannis, who is very possibly the best player in the East, the Bucks start average to above average players. On paper I think you’d be hard pressed to really say the Bucks have a better starting lineup than the Sixers. You could make the point that Giannis is better than Embiid, but when you look at the second best starter through the fifth best starter, the Sixers are better all the way through.

I don’t want to discredit the Bucks, what they’re doing is amazing, and I’m actually very concerned about having to face them, but with rotations being as short as they are, and bench players not getting much court time this far into the playoffs, I’m interested in hearing how you guys see the matchup of Raptors starters vs. Bucks starters. Especially when you consider that if there is anyone with the size, speed and strength to contain Giannis (you can’t really stop him), it would be Kawhi Leonard.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,35596,public,self,How do the Raptors and Bucks starters match up against one another?,0,1557927133,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/bob4n2/how_do_the_raptors_and_bucks_starters_match_up/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First of all the East was historically weak that year. Only 5 teams in the East had a winning record. That is incredibly bad. The #1 seed in the East won 14 fewer games then the #1 seed in the West. The #2 seed in the East won 10 fewer games then the #2 seed in the East. In fact the #1 Seed Pistons would have been the #4 seed in the West that year.

First round: Wizards 41-41

This was a very mediocre team. They were 41-41. But it was even worse then that. Gilbert Arenas by far their best player was injured for the entire series. Without Arenas the Wizards would have been a 30 win team.

Second round: Nets 41-41

Another mediocre team. Neither the Nets or the Wizards even sniff the playoffs in the West

Conference Finals: Pistons 53-29

People confuse the 2007 Pistons with the 2003 Pistons. This was not an elite team. This was not the defensive juggernaut from the 2003-2004 era. The Pistons no longer had 4x DPOTY Ben Wallace. They no longer had Coach Brown. Their best player was Billiups who only made one All NBA team at that point (2nd Team). No one on the team averaged 20 points per game.

Dig deeper and you see that the Pistons 53-29 record was built on beating weak East teams. Their record against the West was a horrible 17-13.  With a Western Conference schedule that Piston team wins only 50 games or less. That would make then the 6th seed in the West behind Dallas (67 wins), Suns (61 wins), Spurs (58 wins), Houston (52 wins), and the Jazz (51 wins).

So if this was the West, Lebron beat 2 non-playoff teams and a 5th or 6th seed to make the Finals. 

Also looking at Lebron's stats during the run. It was good but not great.

Playoff averages: 25 points per game. 41.6% FG. 28.0% 3FG.  51.6% TS. Good not great.

Even in the Piston series he wasn't spectacular except for Game 5.

Game 1 - 5/15 for 10 points

Game 2 - 7/19 for 19 points

Game 6 - 3/11 for 20 points. In Game 6 it was actually Gibson who came up big. He scored 31 points on 9 shots with 15 free throws.

Lebron's stats when we take out Game 5:

21 points per game

41% FG

27% 3FG

Again good but not great. I think we totally overrate this playoff run because of his amazing Game5. But don't forget that Game5 would mean nothing if Gibson didn't come up HUGE in Game6 and score 31.

# First Quarter

* To start the game Gary Harris has looked encouragingly aggressive. With his jumper not hitting it is nice to see him try and abuse Portland's lack of rim protection. Jokic has been knockdown as per, hitting two big threes. 
* Portland's biggest struggle will undoubtedly be from their wing players being unable to hit open jumpers. If they can’t consistently punish the help defense sagging off, Lillard and Mccollum will have to make increasingly tough shots. 
* Denver is doing serious damage inside the paint, getting consistent penetration. Portland looks kind of flat on defense which is surprising. Collins comes in, and should bring some good energy, however with Kanter and Collins on the court they will likely have mobility problems 
* Portland is getting no help from their role players, going 0-6 from three with some bad misses. CJ looks aggressive to start, and picks on Jokic in the PnR. Portland would be smart to really try and abuse him with Lillard and CJ, as you have to punish his lack of mobility. Harris and Craig will do as good of a job as most perimeter players in the league on Portland's two superstar guards, so in order to make it easier for them putting Jokic in the PnR is the logical answer. 
* Portland tries to put Jokic in a hand off situation, Barton does a great job on Hood not giving him a clear lane to the basket. Jokic gets a block but Denver turns it over no the other end. 
* Murray comes back down with a  filthy double clutch layup, and the Denver guards are having a superb first quarter. Lillard tries to attack Jokic in the PnR but Kanter can’t finish his drop off. Murray get fouled in the post by Curry and some lightskin on lightskin crime almost goes down. Cooler heads prevail. Plumlee again gets a great contest on Kanter after Lillard drops him off a nice pass. Again, if the Portland secondary players can’t punish help on Lillard and McCollum they are really going to struggle to win this game. 

**Denver 29 - Portland 17** 

# Key Takeaways 

* Murray and Harris came out ready to hoop. They have both been really aggressive looking to drive to the rim, and have produced well. Jokic had a couple of solid moments hitting two threes, but he will likely turn the gas on as the game progresses. 
* Portland needs there secondary players to do something. If they can’t punish the help defense sagging off them to go to Lillard and CJ they are screwed. Faroq Aminu and notably Kanter have both struggled in key positions in the first quarter, and if this trend continues they will not win this game. 

# Second Quarter

* Denver gets a nice layup on the first possession of the game, with Barton finishing easily over Collins at the rim. On the next play Zach gives up a foul trying to get a board on Plumlee. Barton looks like the chief creator in this second unit for the Nugs, and is looking dynamic in game 7. Collins get a finish off a CJ drive, but again the Portland stars are being swarmed. This Denver team is definitely deep, bringing Monte Morris, Barton and Malik Beasley off the bench is a really big positive.
* Plumlee abuses Collins near the rim for an And-1, with Turner committing a absolutely terrible foul. Portland puts Plumlee in the PnR but again is forced into a extremely tough 1 handed floater outside the paint from the help defense. This is not a long term strategy for success. Collins with an offensive foul on the roll to the rim and he is having an objectively bad game 7. Being abused near the rim on both ends. Denver already in the bonus with nearly 9 minutes left in the second 
* Might already be Dame time, as the Portland offense has struggled mightily, however, Dame is 0-6 as the jumpers are not falling. Denver runs a four out offense with Plumlee in the paint, but gets stiffled. Portland is having a tough time staying in front of the Denver perimeter players, as even Millsap was able to get past Turner to the rim. 
* CJ hits a three off a PnR action, but Barton comes down and picks on Collins in the PnR for a tough floater finish. Jokic is back in and the Blazers try and pick on him but Lillard turns it over for a sweet Monte Morris up and around layup finish. Denver looks like much the better team so far. 
* CJ has been solid to start, and hit some big shots, however the Blazers stand zero chance of winning this game without a showing from Lillard. 0-6 is simply not in the equation for a Portland win. 
* CJ goes back in the PnR at Jokic, and gets a nice one legged runner. CJ with another nasty take at the rim, and he is single handedly keeping this game moderately close. It’s all coming from attacking Jokic in the PnR, as he splits the defense for a crafty finish. Lillard hits a nice stepback and is on the board. Portland is starting to heat up. Portland causes a turnover which leads to some more FT’s as they are in the Bonus. The activity on both ends has picked up for Portland, and they are slowly taking this nuggets crowd out of the game. 9-0 run
* Denver gets a Jokic  post up on Knater, calls the clear out and gets a super awkward rip through runner. I don’t know if he played that but he got the bucket. Millsap gets a great pass from Murray and gets fouled. 
* Portland puts Turner in for Collins who has three fouls, going super small to end the quarter. Lillard gets fouled on a drive and again it's Jokic being punished in the PnR. Kanter is having big problems with Jokic, as he fouls him on one of his awkward drives. That matchup  will likely be the catalyst offensively for Denver as the game winds down to a close. 
* Murray with a beautiful dish in traffic to Jokic off the PnR and gets a nice floater. Denver plays some scrappy defense near the rim and gets the ball back. Denver working the Murray Jokic PnR and get a nice Murray floater. Seems to be they are just wasting time doing anything but having Jokic in some kind of action. He keeps causing mismatches and creating looks either with him hitting shots or demanding attention off the ball. Kanter has consistently been caught in no man's land. 

**Denver 48 - Portland 39** 

# Key Takeaways 

* Portland survived that first half with a solid showing from CJ and some tough, gritty defense. Their offense for extended periods looked shaky at best, as they only scored 39 points. They will need Lillard to come to play in the second half
* Denver was the better team for the majority of that first half. Jokic looked in control and aggressive, and Murray looked dynamic as a ball handler in the PnR. Millsap gave timely contributions and Denver will likely win this game all things equal

# Third Quarter 

* Nuggets start out with a nice motion set, getting Jokic a easy floater in the lane
* Blazers Are looking to post up Hood, but they help off Collins, who proceeds to miss a easy 8 footer and then foul jokic on the rebound. Not his finest showing. 
* Jokic hits another jumper and is starting the third off hot. CJ comes back with a nice layup driving past Jokic. We should be seeing a lot of Jokic in the PnR as the game winds down. The Nuggets on the other hand will likely look to attack Collins in the PnR as he has four fouls. 
* Nuggets go right at Collins off the timeout and get a nice finish by Harris at the rim. Collins can’t really contest and was just standing there. CJ on the other hand is really picking it up, has 23 on 11-16 shooting. Kanter gets a nice finish off a Lillard drop off in the paint. 
* A scramble play gets Malik Beasley an and 1 on Collins, making that his 5th. Rodney hoods looks to have seriously damaged his knee after being hit with a rather innocent looking screen. Hood has been fairly quiet this game, but he gave them at least a somewhat respectable shooter. With him out the Blazers will likely look to either Turner or Harkless, but both have serious limitations offensively that will make it hard for the Blazers to get easy looks. CJ gets another good look at the rim but can’t finish, Blazers are conisstnetly getting solid shots with Jokic in the PnR. Nugs come back with a Jokic post up that has been absolute money all game. With the Nuggets startling line out they can’t really help off anyone, and Kanter is on an island with the much larger and skilled Jokic.
* Kanter fouls Jokic again in the paint. Blazers are really looking to up the tempo, and have had some success pushing the ball getting easy looks off long rebounds. Torrey Craig looks to have injured his right hand, and Barton comes in for him. CJ again doing work in the PnR, with a nice floater in the lane. Both teams are shooting under 20% from three, really mind boggling stat with all the talent on the court. Has to explain the super low score through almost three quarters. 
* Murray with a nasty finish at the rim, but has had a very inefficient night shooting the ball. That being said it would be hard to say he’s had a bad game, facilitating with purpose in the PnR. Plumlee’s FT shot is really busted. 
* Harkless with the nasty offensive rebound and-1 putback, seems to have abandoned the perimeter and is content to crash the class. Jokic goofs on the rebound for the FT and Harkless gets the board again for another bucket. Jokic gets fouled by Leonard on the other end, and really seems like he can get a  good shot whenever he wants. 
* Leonard with the nasty finish off a Lillard drop off in the lane. Dame’s shot has been off but he has done well getting his bigs good looks near the basket. Cj with an absolutely flithly hesitation runner in the lane to give the Blazers the lead, and he is definitely playing like it’s an elimination game. Harkless fouls Monte Morris on a three to end the quarter and the Nugs get three shots. 

# Blazers 71 - Nugget 72

* This is setting up for a fantastic final quarter of basketball. The Blazers have slowly chipped back into the game, on the back of some tough defense and great play from CJ. They have to be happy having the game so close with Dame doing next to nothing. It wouldn’t be surprising to see him replicate Curry’s performance from Friday down the stretch. The Blazers have no answer for Jokic though, and we should see a heavy dose of him to end the game. Probably would favor Denver but it could definitely go either way. 

# Fourth Quarter

* The Nuggets have been unable to get CJ out of the paint, as he misses a very makeable layup to start the fourth. He looks so explosive right now. Barton takes a ugly mid range pull up that misses, and Collins makes a three at the 45 to give Portland the lead. It is insane how bad these teams are shooting from deep. Collins comes back with a block, but Barton gets the rebound and puts it back to tie the game. 
* Collins with a nice pass in the post to Turner who gets the lay up, and he is really playing well to start the fourth. Jokic goes to the table as Mike Malone senses danger. Portland botches the baseline inbound defense and gives up an easy layup to Barton. Collins gets fouled on a drive to the rim, and is really playing well. The Denver bigs have been helping towards the Portland perimeter players all night, giving Collins room to operate which he is finally capitalizing off of. 
* Murray going up to the table and Jokic gets the ball in the post. He finds Morris for an open three which he can’t hit, but Jokic gets fouled on the rebound. Jokic finally misses a three, and Dame Lillard hits his own triple. Uh oh. Blazers up 5. 
* Nugs come back and get Jokic in a Post up with Collins which he defends brilliantly well initially, but the other blazers can't get the rebound and Jokic gets a and-1 on the put back. This is chief Jokic time he needs to get the ball every possession. Lillard is playing off the ball now, and he and CJ are taking turns carving up the nuggets defense for drives to the lane. Jokic comes back and gets a ridiculously easy post up lay in on Collins. If you’re the Nugs don't reinvent the wheel please. 
* Turner gets the and-1 on a  drive, and Portland is up 4. Kanter back in and Jokic misses a three at the top of the arc. Lillard misses his own putting Jokic in the PnR, and Jokic proceeds to miss a nice hook shot in the lane. Kanter throws the ball away on a pass to Curry. Murray misses a easy runner but Portland is struggling on the glass, giving Craig a offensive rebound opportunity which he turns into a foul. 
* Turner gets fouled backing down Will Barton literally from the three point line, he has had a good showing and is playing crucial minutes. Jokic misses a turn over jumpers in the mid-post, and Kanter misses an open jumper from the same distance. Harris misses his own jumper and its turning into a brick fest. 
* Jokic blocks Lillards drive in the PnR, but Murray gets blocked in transition by CJ who is the MVP tonight. Torrey Craig takes an absolutely retarded three pointer with numbers on the break. The Turner post-up is somehow becoming the primary option for Portland down the stretch as he gets fouled again going to the lane. 
* The Nuggets get a wide open three for Millsap off a Jokic post up but can't do anything with it as he bricks the shot. Millsap hits two FT after getting fouled. Lillard knocks down a huge triple to give the Blazers a 7 point lead with 3 minutes. But the Blazers cannot stop fouling on the other end. Their aggressiveness is not translating to good defense, and they are being consistently caught with their hands in the cookie jar. 
* CJ is the focal point of the offense now, and gets a nice fadeaway off a PnR with Jokic. The Nuggets offense has completely dissolved but the Blazers keep fouling them on nonsense plays, giving Denver FT’s. I don’t think Denver's got a FG in the past 4 minutes. Lillard is definitely deferring to CJ, which I guess is nice to see because its obvious Lillard isn’t really on. Dame turns the ball over on a botched drive, and Jokic punishes on a drive of his own to the basket, and the lead is only 1 point. 
* CJ again with a nasty pull up mid range off the PnR putting Jokic  in the action. Denver down three with the ball and Murray hits a huge pull up mid range to cut the lead to 1. 
* Feel like it has to be CJ to get the ball down the stretch, as he has been dynamic at all three levels today. CJ with the ball up top, pure clear out and he hits the huge mid range pull up again. He has been so nasty from 12-18 feet, playing physical and stepping back with confidence. Portland up 3 with 11 seconds remaining. 
* Curry fouls Jokic on a  post up. CJ has 37 on 17-29, wowerz. Jokic misses the first FT, and Kanter comes in the game. He hits the second and Portland calls there final timeout. Blazers up 2 with 11 seconds. 
* Nuggets don't foul on the catch and Turner burns three extra seconds a drive to the rim. Two big FT’s coming. Millsap fouls out with a pretty poor performance 3-13. Turner hits both FT’s to putt Portland up 4 with 8 seconds left. Denver has no timeouts and has missed 16 straight three. The biggest surprise of today is Denver's inability to hit anything from downtown. 
* Jokic misses the three off the inbound and Portland pulls off the improbable with the victory away in game 7. 

# Portland 100 - Denver 96 

Final Thoughts 

* How the hell did Portland win this game without Dame Lillard. CJ went nuclear to end the contest, and the Nuggets inability to hit anything from downtown surely cost them. You have to be so disappointed if you're Denver, but give all credit to Portland. 
* Jokic dominated all game, until there were about 6 minutes left. He got good looks around the paint but simply could not convert. Overall he had a great first playoffs, but it wasn’t enough.

The Rockets are the team that are supposedly built to beat the Warriors. They pushed their series hard, too. The Blazers were predicted to miss the playoffs at the beginning of the season by man, including the Las Vegas oddsmakers. Here's why the Blazers could actually succeed where Houston failed.

The Rockets really only featured one player who could effectively make Durant's life harder: PJ Tucker. In 37.4 possession per game defending Durant in the semi-finals, he made Durant score an average of 1.4 points less on a per-100 possession basis. Only Harden and Gordon can boast a negative differential for the Rockets, and on significantly fewer possession and typically in switch situations. He also had the best team point differential and DET Factor when defending Durant of any big-possession players. Nobody else on the Rockets have as good of numbers across the board defending Durant. 

Against the Nuggets, the most difficult matchup problem was taking on Denver's big man depth. Without Nurkic, they really only had one person who could defend Jokic. It was clearly a problem. This will not be a problem against Golden State; in fact, Kanter's role is almost certainly going to diminish in this next round (unless he plays well enough on offense to force Steve Kerr to adjust). This plays directly into one of Portland's strength: an abundance of rangy, multi-talented wing players who all make a difference on the defensive end.

Both Aminu (-2.3) and Harkless (-9.7) boast a negative point differential for Durant during the regular season (albeit in limited possessions for Harkless), and have DET Factors of 96.1 and 91.3, respectively. The Blazers can also deploy the long and limber Rodney Hood and the tough and disciplined Evan Turner to play in spurts against him, and even Layman and Collins will likely get a crack at him. No one guy can stop Durant, but as a committee, they may be able to save their team a few extra points per game with fresher legs and by mitigating the danger of catching Durant on a switch.

As we all know, switchability is key to defending the Warriors. The Blazers are well built for that; To counteract the Death Lineup (Steph Curry, Thompson, Durant, Iguodala Green), the Blazers can put together any 3 to 4 of Aminu, Harkless, Collins, Turner, and Hood with any 1-2 of Lillard, McCollum, and Seth Curry. Even if you include the much-regressed Livingston in the Warrior’s ultimate switchable lineup, the Blazers still boast a full 8 man rotation. That doesn’t even include Kanter, who has played well in these playoffs and will occasionally demand the presence of Bogut or Looney.

Let’s not forget that these Blazers made it through the second round with their best player underperforming. If that corrects itself as we know it can, and CJ McCollum stays on his hot streak, they are one of the few backcourts that can go toe to toe with the Splash Bros. 

This has the potential to be an incredible Conference Finals, on both ends of the bracket.

I’m calling it Value Adjusted Draft Results (VADR). The idea behind VADR is to understand which teams are the best evaluators of NBA player draft talent by comparing the actual value generated by their draft picks vs. the expected career Win Shares for those picks based on their relative draft position. Basically, I want to isolate a team’s talent picking ability from where they are forced to pick in the draft (due to team record, trades, etc.). 
  
I imagine one could run a regression using career Win Shares by each drafted spot (1-60) over the past--let’s say 40 or 50 years (really whatever period of time that has reliable stats, and can account for team and draft expansion)--to determine the expected Win Shares for each place in the draft order. And then looking at each team’s draft picks for each year they drafted it would be relatively straightforward to determine if they have over or under achieved their draft position.
  
Obviously this would be most useful to evaluate success or failure some time ago, but I imagine things could be tweaked a bit to determine expected Win Shares for different years of service for each draft position so one could have a more immediate sense of draft effectiveness.
  
I’m not sure how to most effectively acquire the data and run the analysis, so any help would be appreciated.

Jokic should be accepted by the community as a game changer to how the ball runs through him to his teammates, and his defense and filling up the lane have been invaluable.  No matter what Durant brings to the Warriors, the Nuggets go nowhere with Jokic.  He is their team identity, and he makes people on his team better.

The Steve Nash led teams to the James Harden led teams are never meant to win rings. 

These teams are high octane offenses that take advantage of the fact that teams simply don't prepare  for a singe game opponent the same way they prepare for a series opponent. They run and gun. They put up high numbers for TV and look great. 

But when it comes to the playoffs, they have to now contend with teams that are preparing for every single thing they do. And D'Antoni does NOT prepare his players for this type of environment at all. 

That free wheeling play and taking advantage of glitchy rules, simply pushing the ball faster will all work in the regular season because most teams are not playing their best ball - on purpose. They get up for specific games, they coast for quarters then lock in during the fourth quarter. 

DnAntoni lead teams push their offense to really no opposition during the regular season, so people think they are doing something big. But come playoffs....They always freeze up and fold under the pressure. They simply aren't built mentally or defensively to win on the biggest stage - and for that I fully fault the coach. 

For me it is why James Harden and Steve Nash (bring on the downvotes) will always be severely overrated. When we talk about how amazing they are, it almost always refers to regular season exploits. And breaking news - fuck the regular season. Its not the most accurate barometer of how good or impact a player is, because the REAL seasons is the playoffs. 

The Rockets have the perfect talent for a DAntoni team. If they want to win 
 in the playoffs though, they need to get rid of him and probably replace CP3 as well. Can't have 2 players like that together to win it all in the playoffs. They need a complete attitude adjustment more than anything though, and that comes from a new coach. 

No Mike DAntoni coached team will ever win a championship in the history of the NBA.

Where do you guys see the rockets come the start of next season. Morey, Harden, and the Rockets owner seemed intent on bringing back the crew and making any necessary moves to improve the team. The problem is the rockets have cap issues and a lot tied up to Harden, Paul, and Capella. 

What trades, signings, draft picks, or other moves do you see them making? Will they rely on in house improvements from guys like Capella, House, etc? Any creative ideas how to work around the cap via trades/signings? Do they simply run the same team and hope for better luck next year?

I think they’re the closest team at the moment towards beating the Warriors and making it out of the west.

I feel like there are a ton of people on this sub that think Lebron is worth a ridiculous amount, but that just doesn’t add up to me. 

First, he has ways to get where he wants to go. He can leak to the media, what teams he’s willing to go to, he can go a step further and openly speak poorly about certain franchises, he can threaten to retire, and he can threaten the Lakers and a potential trade partner with trying to sway Klutch clients away from their teams. We’ve seen Lebron try to control things from behind the scenes a million times and this is a situation where you’d imagine he would be even more aggressive in doing that. 

Next, he’s old. He has a ton of miles on his legs. His athleticism has declined over the past few years. He just had his first semi major injury and he never quite looked himself this year. He was probably still a top 5 player, but I think it’s safe to say that he isn’t the best player in the world by a large margin. Unless you have a prebuilt contender around him, even after the trade does it make sense to trade for him? He’s likely only going to be worse next year and the year after. You’d hope you have at least a 2 year window where lebron is still an all NBA type player, but that’s not guaranteed and who knows what you have in the last year of that deal. Unless your team’s window is the next couple of years, what can you realistically justify giving up for him? The older teams that make sense for him are also the ones that have been throwing every asset at trying to win now the past couple of years. 

Finally, who knows what kind of chemistry issues and drama he’s going to bring with him. Every place he goes turns into a circus, he ends up with ton of control, and the team revolves around him on the court. You have to believe that your team and coach, if you’re committed to him, is able to handle that. You don’t want to upset a younger star that could be your future to bring in Lebron for the next 3 years.

I’m trying to think of realistic landing spots and the teams that come to mind are the Rockets, Spurs, Warriors, Knicks, Thunder, and maybe a Detroit or Portland? Outside of the Knicks, none of those teams have a ton of assets and the Knicks are likely getting KD. He would have to sign off on it and they could likely have AD instead.

He is one of the most polarizing figures to today's current sports media, but what they are doing (ESPN in particular) is trying to castigate Butler as a ""locker room cancer"". From what he has shown in Philly, the opposite can be said about him. Let's take a look into why Butler will be a 76ers past this season.



**FIT**

When he got traded to Philly, there were a lot of initial questions, rightfully so, that asked how Butler would fit with the team. Then the January 5th, 2019 ESPN report came out, which was proven by Butler, coach Brett Brown, and other sports media to have been exaggerated for a cheap story. Also, with Tobias Harris joining the team just a month after the ""exchange"", people questioned Butler's fit even more. As the Sixers closed out the season, losing games to teams like Atlanta and Dallas, people began to wonder if Jimmy was just coasting and waiting until playoff time or if he had actually lost a step and wasn't an all-star anymore. One telling statistic: Philly, by far, had the least pick and rolls ran this entire season. Butler thrives in those sets. Brett Brown was criticized for his decision to continue running DHO's as the main offensive playcall. However, both Butler and Brown shown they had more up their sleeve. The pick and roll offense that Philly has been running so far in the Playoffs has worked magnificently. There are quite a few reasons why this has worked out as well as it has. Firstly, Butler has shown he was conserving his best energy for the postseason, as we Sixers fans were hoping he would. Another very important reason Jimmy has been thriving is because of Brett Freakin' Brown, who has made the proper adjustments to best fit his player's strengths and help the team as a whole. By Brown deciding to run more pick and roll plays, Jimmy is able to constantly either pound the ball inside and drive for 2 or draw a double team and kick out to a shooter at the 3-point line, a lot of times Tobias Harris (he needs to hit his open shots, looked good in Game 6). Even more, Brown gave Butler more freedom by completely removing true Processor TJ McConnell from the rotation altogether in order to be able to stagger his stars (at least 2 of Embiid, Simmons, Butler, and Harris on the floor each second of the game), and thus making Jimmy the de facto point guard of the 2nd unit. Another huge factor to take into all of this is the fact that the other players aren't on an ego trip and it helps them as well. It is a lot tougher to double-team the Sixers offense with as many consistent (hopefully Ben will get there 100%) threats as there are. They haven't complained one bit, they thoroughly enjoy his winning attitude, and they are some of the most unselfish players in the league (looking at you Tobias Harris!) Also, [this](https://sixerswire.usatoday.com/2019/05/07/jimmy-butler-went-out-of-his-way-to-support-joel-embiid-after-game-5/).



**FUTURE**

Elton Brand has been playing 4-D chess from the day he arrived as GM. He traded for Butler full well knowing he was in the final year of his contract. People knew he was taking a huge risk giving up two guys on team-friendly multi-year contracts for a guy on an expiring deal who completely disliked his previous organization. And then Brand ending up making the 2 AM Tobias Harris deal. He gave up assets, sure, but he also did get a close-to-all-star-caliber player in Tobias Harris, and got them an absolute gem on the bench in Mike Scott, who should also be re-signed. People say he gave up too much to quickly. And maybe he did. People say the at least one of Harris or Butler will leave this summer. This is where I think the opposite. Team owner Joshua Harris has made it clear he wants these guys here to stay, and he doesn't care about paying taxes for going over salary cap limits, he wants their core 4 intact. Elton Brand said the same: he would not have made these trades if he did not have firm belief that both Butler and Harris would re-sign this summer. In fact, Brand talked to Butler's agent, crew, etc and got their assurance that if all went well, Jimmy would be willing to stay with the 76ers. This, to me, was a smart move by Brand, because neither was going to sign with Philly this offseason if they finished out their contacts with their respective teams before the trades. Now that they are here, it will be hard for them to not accept the max Philly can offer them, considering Philly has both of their bird rights (and that of sharpshooter JJ Redick as well). This puts them in prime position to re-sign both. The team, over the summer, can continue to build chemistry on top of the talent they have already shown this postseason. Remember, going into the playoffs, Philly's Phantastic 5 had only played in less than 20 games all together in the lineup. That would only improve with a whole summer and full regular season ahead of them. Another interesting thing to note. Butler turns 30 in September, and he has said he couldn't see himself playing past 35. Philly is the only team (because of bird rights) that can offer him a 5-year max, giving him a great deal as he then heads into retirement.



**FAN RECEPTION**

Philly fans have always been especially tough towards their own sports teams, that's what makes 'em Philly fans. Jimmy Butler displays this same mentality. If Allen Iverson has his back and tells him he's the right man for Philly, then we should all heed that advice! For more, just check out r/Sixers to see all the ""Max Him!!"" comments...




**BUTLER'S OWN COMMENTS**

Let's hear from the man himself:

* ""Night and day"" (regarding difference between playing for T-Wolves and playing for Sixers)

* ""It's so much...fun to play with these guys. I love this group of guys.""

* ""Everybody wants to win. And when somebody messes up, you talk to them, they don't take it personal and they do their job. I think everybody is such a good basketball player, and we all want to do right, that sometimes we mess up.""

* ""When you put five really good basketball players out there, the job is easy because the ball is going to move. ""Guys are going to shoot when open, pass to the open guy. Basketball is just that easy. With this group of guys, it is really easy.""

* ""We're not going to let the media tear us apart.""

I'm a bit new to basketball analytics, and I wanted to ask where people think the 'MoreyBall' analytics plan starts to breakdown.

&amp;#x200B;

As someone new to basketball analytics, I've only watched the Rockets the last two postseasons. In that period of time, Morey has explained losses through:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Missing 27 straight threes - at least a 5+ sigma event (layman's terms, a very very very unlikely event)

&amp;#x200B;

2) If you look at the implied math on the Rockets' foul analysis from the 2018 WCF, they are implying another 5 sigma event for missed calls / referee impact

&amp;#x200B;

3) Math on the Rockets' efficiency metrics in the playoffs vs. regular season seem to imply at least a \~3 sigma level of underperformance compared to other playoff data sets. Playing an all-time great team in the Warriors probably makes this data point less important as there's a hard to quantify impact from playing an extremely tough team

&amp;#x200B;

Daryl seems like a relatively smart person, so I'm sure he would agree that any time you receive model outputs saying repeated 5 sigma events are the reason you're losing, you immediately need to revisit your model because it is highly highly highly likely the model is significantly flawed. I'd love to start a discussion on where we think the 'Moreyball' model starts to breakdown. Most of the assumptions widely discussed (hunt fouls because they're insane efficiency, 3 &gt; 2, fouls on 3s and corner 3s by far most important, shots near the rim, etc.) are individually all correct. The immediate reasons that come to mind for me that I'll eventually post analyses for:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Playoff basketball fouls are not reffed the same way as in the regular season

&amp;#x200B;

2) Morey is asking D'Antoni to have the team play a slower pace vs. the Warriors. I think he believes the Rockets are not as talented, so reducing the number of possessions should jack up variance in the games, which the Rockets need to win. The Rockets do not practice this in the regular season and therefore are less efficient

&amp;#x200B;

3) This will be hard to analyze, but playoff basketball seems to be all about winning 50-50 positions and stepping up in the 3 - 5 plays you are able to as a role player. The reliance on isolation basketball may not foster an environment where role players are ready to step up. I say this primarily because qualitatively, it seems to me that some of the more successful coaches like Pop, Kerr, Phil Jackson have all preached making sure the entire team is involved

In the 4th quarter of G6, GSW went basic with a repetitive Steph Curry &amp; Draymond Green right-side pick &amp; roll. Yet they executed it with such clinical savagery - mixing in an array of counter-moves &amp; variations that progressively torched everything Houston responded with. The Warriors rammed the near same action down Houston's throat **10 times** and came away with **20 crucial points** in what was probably the best Warriors' performance in a long time.

------------------

*Breakdown:*

[1. Curry Open Layup 2-pts](https://streamable.com/psobg)

CP3 on Curry; Tucker on Draymond. Draymond fakes a left screen coming in from behind CP3. CP3 is badly beaten as Curry simply drives left. It's reasonable to conclude that either CP3 is expecting Tucker to be in place to help on the drive or Houston was comfortable forcing Curry left on his injured hand (Curry's handles were sloppy up to this point in the game). GSW curls Klay up from the left corner to distract any potential Rockets help-D. Open lay-up

[2. Curry 3-pter](https://streamable.com/fqy86)

Gordon on Curry; Capela on Draymond. Draymond left screen; Houston switches. Capela who has played Curry tight the entire game momentarily forgets Curry's range and sinks to the 3-pt line. Curry pulls up from almost 30ft. 

[3. Curry floater 2-pts](https://streamable.com/s1lbc)

Roughly a repeat of #1. However, this time the screen from up top and Paul should clearly know that it's coming. Paul somehow anticipating a Curry pull-up, stupidly hops straight up and is badly beaten once again. With no defender on his right hip, Curry finishes with a clean floater over Harden. 

[4. Green to Looney missed alley-oop](https://streamable.com/kdqku)

CP3 is now off and Rivers is on Curry; Tucker still on Draymond. The warriors run the same action as before, but Houston now has Tucker show/trap on the left to prevent a Curry drive. Curry passes out of pressure to Draymond rolling to the rim, but Looney can't finish the alley-oop as Harden is there to help off the Iguodala on the left-corner.

[5. Looney put in 2-pts](https://streamable.com/x0wye)

Basically a rerun of #4, but this time there's a minor tweak. Iguodala isn't on the left corner anymore (Klay is) and Harden can't get in position to help (Gordon is occupied by Klay). Looney finishes the simple put-in after Draymond draws the Capela off him.

[6. Curry 3-pter](https://streamable.com/cnd01)

CP3 is back in on Curry; Tucker on Draymond. This where things get pretty. By now, the Warriors can convincingly sell both Curry's drive left as well as Draymond rolling to the rim. Tucker shows to the left and Houston thinks it's going to be a replay of #4 &amp; #5, but GSW throws in a killer counter: after Curry hits Draymond fake rolling, Draymond reverses the ball back to Curry for a 3. Paul is completely befuddled by this and loses Curry. 

[7. Green missed lay-up](https://streamable.com/g7133)

Houston now takes CP3 off Curry and puts him on CP3, so it's Gordon on Curry &amp; Tucker on Draymond. What happens is a rough re-run of #4 &amp; #5, but here CP3 is smart enough to switch Thompson off to Harden and seal off Looney so that Draymond can't dump the ball off to anyone and has to go up against Capela by himself.

[8. Curry lay-up 2pts](https://streamable.com/7d1cn)

Gordon on Curry; Tucker on Draymond. Now Houston will straight up force a switch to get Tucker on Curry by cheating, i.e. linking arms or grabbing Draymond's waist to prevent him from rolling/slipping to the rim. But it's too late because Curry has warmed up and Tucker is tired from having already accumulated 40 minutes. Tucker reaches; Curry teaches. Capela is too slow to react and help as Curry finishes an easy lay-up.

[9. Curry pull-up 3-pter](https://streamable.com/kg8pp)

Near the same as above. Curry dances with Tucker and drains a 3. 

[10. Drive and kick Klay 3-pter](https://streamable.com/6qny7)

Like #8 &amp; #9, but with a GSW counter. Instead of accepting the switch this time, Curry attacks Gordon to the right just as Draymond appears to screen Gordon to the left. Curry then reverses back into Draymond's screen effectively force-converting Houston's attempt to switch into a trap. Curry finds Draymond rolling and it's effectively a replay of #4 except Draymond finds Iguodala in the corner who then swings it to Klay for a 3.

--------------------

*Additional notes:*

- Houston should have tried switching on Curry earlier. My feeling is that they greatly underestimated Curry after his cold first half, while overestimating the effect of Curry's injury had on him (hence sloppily letting him attack the basket). By running some tame PnR defence against Curry, they let him get going; before they realized the folly of it, he was fully warmed up. 

- Given the inattentiveness and poor defense by certain Rockets, it's reasonable to conjecture that Houston's watertight defense against Curry in the first half sapped their energy considerably; whereas Curry's foul trouble gave him relatively fresh legs during the 4th quarter.

- Paul was exposed during key junctures as he was [late in the last game](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/bmfsex/post_game_thread_the_golden_state_warriors_defeat/emwcm61/). At this point in his career, he only lives up to reputation as a savvy veteran defender on occasion and he can no longer be relied upon as a defensive stalwart (to the level of papering over his significant athletic disadvantage).",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,34667,public,self,Breaking down the Warriors' Curry-Green right-side PnR that won them G6,0,1557669187,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/bn96rf/breaking_down_the_warriors_currygreen_rightside/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

**Coming from a 3X NBA champion future hall of fame player, wisdom radiates from these words.**

&amp;#x200B;

Once upon a time in December 2008, Stephen Curry was a young junior stud muffin for the Davidson Wildcats. His team was playing West Virginia on national TV and this was a big chance to further improve his reputation.

Unfortunately a slow start simmered the tide just a little bit.

&amp;#x200B;

**He shot 1-15 in the first half.** 

Not 0-5, can you IMAGINE if any NBA player put up this shooting performance in a half and the meltdown that would ensue on this forum?

&amp;#x200B;

Similar to what happened tonight, he finished the game on 8-12 shooting and Davidson sent West Virginia back to the mountains in a 68-65 victory.

My high school basketball coach at the time made sure to mention this the next day as a lesson to keep shooting the ball.

&amp;#x200B;

**Postgame Press Conference**

&amp;#x200B;

***""Our defense really carried us in the 2nd half to allow that offensive rhythm to flow""***

The twitter world is steaming from the swag sauce Curry produced and the first thing the chef does in the postgame press conference is give credit to the defense. 

&amp;#x200B;

**\*Talks about how he didn't like it in the first half when he was subbed out for Quinn Cook so he didn't get his 3rd foul.**

One key factor that sticks out when Curry mentions this is his honesty. He was pissed, he's unafraid to scare that he's pissed, but ends the statement by saying that him and Steve Kerr have a good enough relationship to work through a scenario like this. 

It's the little things that lead to success.

&amp;#x200B;

**Belief, Chemistry, Composure**

How Curry said it's possible to get a road win in 21 consecutive playoff games. You can infer this is what he believes it takes to win 3/4 NBA championships as well.

&amp;#x200B;

***""The only thing I did well was not turn the ball over in the 12 minutes I was out there on the floor. I find a positive in everything""***

Despite the atrocious first half, Curry shows how **composure** is a key aspect of the Warriors moving forward. He didn't score a single point but realizes he didn't turn the ball over and used that unseen momentum to propel his team in the 2nd half with some help from the invisible forces of nature.

&amp;#x200B;

**Even-Keel, Belief, Positivity, Energy**

All words Curry emphasizes in this press conference. This is a theme.

&amp;#x200B;

***""Do you feel that you were underestimated coming into this series""***

With the last question, every single ounce of nonverbal communication when seeing Curry screams ""yes he thinks he was"" but he pauses to reflect on the right words to say and simply states ""there's been a lot of noise from both sides"".

&amp;#x200B;

Critics were ringing his phone nonstop and he came through clutch.

There is still another game to be played and if the 76ers' can get to the Eastern Conference Finals the national narrative will take a 180.

Simmons put on the usual showcase that happens when he's confident on offense. 21 points, 8 rebounds, 6 assists, a force of nature driving to the basket, finishing alley oop dunks, all beautiful stuff.

But where Ben Simmons took another step towards greatness last night was his defense.

Not known for being a defensive stud muffin, he sure added some whipped cream flavoring to his arsenal last night.

He shut down every single player he guarded besides Kawhi, and I would describe Simmons' defense on Kawhi monumental enough to keep the shift of the game going in Philadelphia's favor.

The last time a series has shifted momentum so rapidly I cannot remember, Boston/Milwaukee last year comes close. 

To remember that Simmons is only 22 years old is even more insane. There have been a lot of ups and downs, but when looking at the picture from a broad viewpoint he has been a top 30 overall player since his first minute on the court. 

His ceiling? Debatable. Very debatable.

But his floor? The only other rookie since 2010 to be a top 30 player the minute he stepped on the floor was maybe Blake Griffin and that is a big maybe.

Shooting mechanics need to improve sure, but he just changed the series around in a very unexpected fashion.

I asked a question on r/ askeurope about what they liked and don't like about American sports, and a lot hated this system of rewarding bad teams.

  Like I  said not going to lie if I had the chance to get Zion and league allowed this then I would honestly understand f we had to tank, but again it is not me or what spiders is to me. Even when my team won 12 games one year, I absolutely hated it. We got like the third pick that year as well. But again seeing the Sixers be  one game from the ECF is more aggravating than watch GS win two straight or anything Harden does. If they make it next round or even make and win the finals how would you guys feel starting hearing the media to tell viewers winning 47 games in three years is the greatest rebuild in history? I cannot ever graspenor understand the praise and arrogance this process is. It's insulting to the NBA and I admit never saw this until the Sixers fans and organization made their rebuild a slogan which is not spread across the NBA and other sports. 

 I just feel this is an issue that needs to be looked at. It's hard to explain and I can honestly go hours. It I tell you IDC if Cavs got Lebron at number one, Bulls got MJ at three, and etc but they didn't do what the Sixers did. It is the example of lazy people getting rewarded and this is what could potentially be seen as successful in our sports. I get it the draft and tankin are ways to make out league fair. I'm not against the draft or rewarding bad teams but POLICE it. If a team like the Knicks gets Zion this year, I don't want them to get a top five or even ten pick for another two to three years. People think it's childish to whine about the moral issues about this issue, but it should be taken serious. It's insulting to me our country tells every American to work hard and sometimes get underpaid with not enough time to spend with our families but a team like the Sixers could purposely put the worst teams of all time for three years and get rewarded for it.

Now I feel it is 80% he is staying. Why?

RESPECT

KD has been absolutely balling out this playoffs. Lebron didn't make the playoffs. Those 2 factors have made the majority of the sports media say that KD is now the Best in the World. IMO, the main reason why KD would leave is because he felt he never would get the just respect as long as he was playing with the Warriors. But now that the majority thinks he's the Best why would he leave? He has the respect he was searching for.


LOVE

KD wants to be loved by the fans. And the Warrior fans have been doing a great job this post season. There were several VERY STRONG MVP chants in the Oracle for KD. You could tell it effected KD. On one occassion he even was shaking his head as he took the free throws. Almost saying 'I can't believe it' they actually have embraced me. I was also surprised that Klay flatout said KD was the best player on the team. And Kerr said KD was the best in the world. He is getting love from the fans, teammates, and the coach.

HISTORY

If the Warriors 3-peat they have a chance to make history.  Four Peat. Even Jordan could not do it. No one did it in over 50 years. Being the best player on a Four Peat team would be incredible. He would also have the chance to be a 4-Peat FMVP. Not even Jordan did that. 

ROCKETS WILD CARD

If the Warriors lose to the Rockets it would further the narrative that the Warriors need KD. Badly. But even if the Warriors do beat the Rockets it is only the 2nd round so it won't be held against KD. KD still has a chance to prove his worth again in the WCF and Finals.

What can the NBA do to fix officiating? I can't stand that so much focus is on the refs. And its an absolute joke that certain refs are actually known by name by many fans. Here is what I would do to fix it:

Punish Floppers

This has to end. Flopping is reaching ridiculous levels. Flopping makes it 100x harder to officiate games. How the heck do we expect the officials to make calls if players are constantly trying to fool and mislead the officials. What should be done?

If a foul is called on an obvious flop then it can be reviewed. Just like you review a flagrant foul. Yes this will lead to more reviews in the short term. But eventually this will cut down on flopping massively. If the player is judged to have flopped then its a technical foul and the foul call is rescinded. After 5 technical flops a player gets suspended for 1 game in the regular season. In the post season it gets added to the normal technical foul count. 

IMO, flopping is the main reason officiating is so poor. Go back to the 80's and most of the 90's. Hardly anyone flopped. And that made calling games so much easier. I have absolutely ZERO sympathy for floppers. It ruins the game. It ruins the integrity of the game. It makes it a much worse product. Get rid of it. 

Some Rule Changes

Update the travel rules. They are way too technical. Just like how the NFL catch rules were. If a movement looks awkward it should be a travel. Period. Some of the stepbacks and eurostep moves just look so wrong. Those should be called as travels. I don't care about gather steps. That is bull. If a move looks wrong and awkward it should be called a travel. 

Update charging rule. I'm sick of players baiting for weakside charges. Irritating and dangerous. You should not reward a defender who basically is undercutting someone driving to the hoop. Instead enforce verticality more. Defenders should be jumping in the air, not stepping under someone in the air. The current charge rules are dangerous. Also we need to enforce offensive push offs. Ridiculous that players can literally elbow defenders into the shadow realm with no foul.

Outlaw intentional fouls except for the last 2 minutes of the game. I'm sick of seeing the most exciting play in basketball (fast break) be short circuited because of intentional fouls. These are not even basketball plays. Player are not even going for the ball. These should be punished with 2 free throws and the ball. I'm sick of fouls that are not basketball plays. 

Accountability

Refs need to be held more accountable. I've never heard of a ref being fired or demoted because of poor performance. Players, coaches, and GM's are constantly held accountable. Why not refs? Get rid of the 2 minute report. Have the lead ref available to the press after the game.

Have a 4th Ref

But this 'ref' will have access to the replay monitors. He will have a direct line of communication with the Head ref. He will be able to notify the refs on the court about possible flops, flagrent fouls. He should also be able to overturn non-judgement calls such as stepping out of bounds.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,34399,public,self,How to FIX NBA officiating,0,1557660062,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/bmzhpd/how_to_fix_nba_officiating/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Which match-ups should we keep an eye on? Which players will be the X-Factors and how will KD's absence help or hurt their contribution. 


I'll start things off: 

Warriors : KD has obviously been the engine for this team and his usage rate and efficiency is going to be sorely missed. Curry and Klay have to step up but they both have been struggling. I'm curious as to how Kerr is going to stagger his players. They are definitely going to try their usual ball movement with screens to get Klay and Curry open but what happens if they start off cold? Go 0-4 or something akin? Is he going to stick to his plan and hope the shots start to fall? What if only one of them is going and the other is doubled? 

In terms of their defensive scheme: KD hasn't been a defensive beast but his length was a trouble maker and he could switch onto anyone. Are they going to double Harden if he gets going? Rockets are going to try to get Curry in foul trouble by trying to get him to defend Harden and Paul and he is a poor IQ defender...Iggy,Draymond and Looney need to box out and avoid Tucker/Capela grabbing those rebounds.

Rockets: They have the home court and they smell blood in the water so I'm hoping they come in with the killer mentality. Offensively I know Capela hasn't been playing well so I'm not sure if this is why they aren't going for the PnR with him and Harden (maybe one of you guys can break that down for me?) but if the shots aren't falling I'm hoping they run this often. Harden needs switch on to Curry or Dray and cook them on the drive and CP3 needs to continue make his presence felt and even take some more shots. 

Defense: They gotta deny Curry the ball and force Klay or Draymond to be the playmaker. They absolutely can't let either of them get in rhythm so attack them on offense and play aggressive on defense. If Capela is on the floor and he is switched on to Curry he should take away his 3-PT shot and force him to drive and make a layup.

The rockets can double Steph in pick and roll when anyone except Draymond is the roll man, they can do the same off pindowns for Steph and Klay.

Draymond was a much better shooter, Livingston was much better, Steph was better in ISO’s and the pick and roll, teams didn’t know how to defend them as well as they do now, and they had way more wing depth and guys who could shoot off the bench and be spark plugs.

The Rockets have overall defended Steph very well so far in the series, and even though he went off after KD got injured, I’m inclined to think this injury will make it even harder for Steph to score.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,34367,public,self,Will the Warriors be able to score without KD?,0,1557656035,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/bmvdw5/will_the_warriors_be_able_to_score_without_kd/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I could sound like an absolute dumbass, but I want someone to actually read this and tell me if I’m overreacting or not.*

Disclaimer: this doesn't prove anything about game-fixing. But it does look awfully suspicious. Also, this isn't just unjustified whining — I tried to get as much evidence as I could, and hyperlinked every foul I reference so you can decide for yourself how justified the whistles were.  

&amp;#x200B;

The Bovada over-under line for Sixers-Raptors Game 6 opened at 213.5, but was bet down to 211.5 by tipoff. 56 percent of money was still on the under. 

&amp;#x200B;

At 4:47 in the 4th quarter, the score was Sixers 101 - Raptors 80. 181 total points, 31 points shy of the over. With both teams seemingly ready to slow the game down and the Raptors about to throw in the towel, there appeared to be no chance at hitting the over. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over the next 58 seconds between 4:47 and a Sixers timeout at 3:49, the two teams combined to shoot 11 free throws (7 for Toronto and 4 for Philly). The fouls-only play by play for those 58 seconds looked like this: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Ben Simmons shoots 2 free throws [(4:47)](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&amp;GameID=0041800216&amp;GameEventID=584&amp;Season=2018-19&amp;title=Green%20Personal%20Take%20Foul%20(P3.PN)%20(T.Washington))

6. Away-from-play foul on J.J. Redick, Danny Green shoots 1 free throw and the Raptors keep the ball [(4:04)](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&amp;GameID=0041800216&amp;GameEventID=613&amp;Season=2018-19&amp;title=Redick%20AWAY.FROM.PLAY.FOUL%20(P5.PN)%20(Z.Zarba))

8. Personal foul on Serge Ibaka. Sixers are in the bonus, so Jimmy Butler shoots 2 free throws [(3:49)](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&amp;GameID=0041800216&amp;GameEventID=620&amp;Season=2018-19&amp;title=Ibaka%20P.FOUL%20(P6.PN)%20(J.Goble))

&amp;#x200B;

All fouls are hyperlinked — you can decide for yourself how legitimate some of the calls were. The two teams had not shot 11 free throws combined in any of the first three quarters. They'd just done it in 58 *seconds.* 

&amp;#x200B;

All of a sudden, with 3:33 left the Sixers call a timeout. Both teams sub in their deep benches. Over a 74-second span, the score had gone from 101-80 to 106-87. 12 points in only 74 seconds, or a point scored every 6 seconds. The total reached 193, within reach of the 211.5 over-under. It would take only 19 points over the next 3:33 of garbage time to hit the over-under — still a pretty large number, but doable thanks to a flurry of whistles. 

&amp;#x200B;

Predictably, the garbage time defense was basically nonexistent. Both teams threw in a few threes and open layups — and the refs, although not quite so blatantly this time, nudged the odds a bit more with another six free throws in the final 3:33. 

&amp;#x200B;

With 36 seconds to play, Toronto got a steal and a runout dunk to make the score Sixers 112 - Raptors 101. 213 points. Remember, the over-under was 211.5. Over the last 4:47 of the game, the Sixers and Raptors combined for 32 points and 19 free throws. According to Basketball Reference, there hadn't been a 32-point five-minute stretch in any of the first four games. 

&amp;#x200B;

The two teams shot 36 free throws in the first 43:13 of the game, for a rate of about one free throw every 80 seconds. For the last 4:47, the two teams shot 19 free throws, for a rate of about one free throw every 15 seconds — and for that one 58-second stretch between 4:47 and 3:49, one free throw every six seconds. 

&amp;#x200B;

Again, this doesn't prove anything for certain. But when the free throw rate more than **QUINTUPLES** in garbage time of a twenty-point game, two teams combine for their highest-scoring five minute stretch of the series, and the two teams just *barely* cover the over, it seems very suspicious. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: In garbage time over the last 4:47 of the Sixers-Raptors game — a stretch that began with Philly up 21 — the two teams shot 19 free throws, more than five times as many as expected, and the two teams combined for 32 points, the highest-scoring five minute stretch of the series. This allowed the teams to cover a 211.5 over-under spread with 213 total points. This isn't definitive proof of game fixing, but to me it's awful suspicious.**",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,34337,public,self,Am I being a dumbass or did the refs attempt to nudge the over-under at the end of Raptors-Sixers?,0,1557654236,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/bmtgwz/am_i_being_a_dumbass_or_did_the_refs_attempt_to/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

KD signs an 'Opt-in-and-trade' for either Gordon Hayward or Al Horford. This then clearing cap room needed to sign KD.

* Why does KD want to play for the Celtics?

He wants to play with Kyrie. Boston was his second option for teams when he signed with GS in 2016. He would be the best player on the team. Taking them to a ring would be good for his legacy. Big market but not the pressure of New York. Proven front office.

* Why do GS want Gordon Hayward?

GH fits the GS system and continues to improve as he recovers from his injury.

* Why do GS want Al Horford?

They take on a like up of Steph, Klay, \_\_\_\_\_, Draymond, Al. This is a solid line up and they can then offer Al a lesser contract into the future as he ages.

* Why does KD opt in instead of signing the max?

Similar to CP3 with the sign and trade to Houston, however, KD would be younger and less injury prone than CP3 seeming this move to be less risky than what Chris did.

Additionally, the team could either run with the young squad or still make moves to add Anthony Davis too.

Often players who have the chance for an uncontested defensive rebound choose to let the ball go out of bounds rather than grabbing the ball.  I assume they do so because it is deemed advantageous to reset and inbound rather than go straight to transition.

I have the following thoughts/questions:

- Am I correct in thinking that a player who does this has forgone adding a rebound to his stat line?  Does it make a difference if the ball has already hit the floor versus being caught from midair?

- What is the advantage gained from doing this versus grabbing the ball and pushing?  Obviously the score and clock affect this choice, but what other factors are considered?

- If this is an example of a player forgoing another rebound, would this be a way to quantify someone who is stat chasing?

With the last 3 seasons of Westbrook’s triple double pursuits, there’s been much talk about him adjusting his game to maximize stats to the exclusion of other team objectives.  Westbrook is not the only player who has been charged with this.  As a Mavs fan, I remember much noise being made over DeAndre Jordan chasing rebounds to the point of pushing Luka out of the way for an uncontested board.  If it is true that there is a meaningful advantage to inbounding versus rebounding and that a player would need to sacrifice a rebound to claim this advantage, then could this be a way of quantifying a player’s stat padding?

I played ball all through high school and the only coaching I remember on this situation was to let the ball go out if the defense was close by so as to not risk turnovers.  There was little incentive for us to pad rebound stats as none of us were expecting to play past high school and at the time (mid 90s) rebounding stats in rural high schools were barely tracked, so this conflict wouldn’t have come up.

I realize people can argue the Warriors were trying to get Harden in early foul trouble by picking up a few cheap ones.    But this was Iguodala - shooting 35% from the FT line this series and was even worse in the series against the Clippers.  And considering his last few playoff rounds, 25-35% is not far from the norm.  And the Warriors were somewhat successful.

Now for the Warriors,i was really surprised that they managed to snatch this game when KD went down,imho Harden and CP3 should have put them in the proverbial chokehold and finished this series right then and there but hats off to Curry,Klay,Draymond and Looney on not giving up and showing immense mental fortitude in the fourth quarter,they really were fucking giants out there to quote Steve Kerr.

But the question now is do they really have a shot to win this without Durant or is their roster way to thin at this juncture to even remotely believe that they could pull it off? 

Argument for some miracle win would be that Curry and Klay could have a supernova game in them still and they could thereby compensate for KD's production.They are the best shooting backcourt ever and you have respect that,but it's going to be really hard now that all the attention from the defense will be on them and spacing will be off playing without Durant.

And off course the argument against it is that besides their starting five of Curry,Klay,Iggy,Dray and Looney they really don't have any semblance of a bench that can be a net positive on the floor.Guys like Livingston,Mckinnie,Jerebko,Bogut,Bell and Cook have proved to be mostly unplayable against the Rockets and they will be exploited heavily if they play longer minutes,but they say the role players flourish at home and who knows,some of these scrubs might have a game of their lives at Oracle.

I have been for a long time, even before their championship runs began. I am also just a huge basketball fan in general. I used to play all through high school and a little bit in college. 

&amp;#x200B;

The series, so far, has been competitive which is great. The one issue I am having is I feel like I am watching an artificial form of basketball because of the high level of involvement from the refs. Calls go both ways for the most part and I am not accusing the refs of ruining any of the Warriors' chances to win a game. The fast is that a few bad calls should never decide a game if you are a good team. The problem I am having is with the flopping from Harden and Chris Paul. The other issue is the clear push offs by Chris Paul and Harden when they are dribbling in iso. It is blatantly obvious and it opens up a 3-4 foot space where they can set up a dribble move, hesitation, or shoot the ball. Then when a Warriors defender tries to recover, Harden and Paul will use their momentum to draw a foul. This creates a serious issue in my mind going forward because how are you supposed to defend that? You get called for a foul if you get too close because they have mastered the art of drawing fouls, flops or not. If you give more space you allow them to set up a perimeter pass to an open shooter or a drive to the lane and then a foul is usually called there as well. I know refs have a hard job, but what do people think? Pretend this is your favorite team (since I know there is a lot of negative bias against the Warriors in the league).

Really. Then he goes on to compare KD's stats now compared to what stats he put up in OKC. But of course he fails to bring up how historically bad those OKC teams were with spacing. 

So now its time to give the other side of the story. Look at OKC's spacing when KD was there.

2011/2012 - Pretty good spacing with Harden. KD averaged 30 per game on 65% TS and lost to absolute prime Lebron in the Finals. KD had a 63.2% TS in the playoffs. Just shows how efficient he can be with at a good shooter with him.

2012/2013 - Kevin Martin is a good shooter. But OKC got derailed when Westbrook got hurt. Lost in 2nd round. With a healthy Westbrook this team had a great chance of winning the title.

This is where we things get real bad.

2013/2014 - Westbrook, Thabo, Ibaka, Perkins. Absolutely HORRIBLE 3 point shooting. Westbrook is bad. Thabo shot 31% even though he was left wide open constantly. Ibaka attempted less then 0.8 three point shots a game and was zero threat. Perkins absolutely horrible. 

Spacing was absolute crap. Teams could double team KD 30 feet from the basket without consequence and leave Westbrook/Thabo/Ibaka wide open. To make maters worse the paint was absolutely packed because Perkins was zero threat. Constant double teams and a packed paint. Then Westbrook missed half the season. So Reggie Jackson a 33% 3FG took his place. Absolute miracle that team won 59 games. 

KD put up an amazing 32/7/5 on 63.5% TS without another All Star for half the season and absolute CRAP spacing.

2014/2015 - Westbrook, Roberson, Ibaka, Adams. This literally could be the worse 4 man shooting line up of all time. Westbrook shot a horrible 29% 3FG, Roberson a laughable 27%, and Adams could not shoot beyond 5 feet. Ibaka was okay. But he only attempted 3 per game. Also note that Ibaka cannot dribble, his shot takes forever, and he cannot pass. So teams could basically leave him open and then close out hard late without bad consequence. KD breaks his foot.

2015/2016 - Westbrook, Roberson, Ibaka, Adams. Here we go again with a historically horrible shooting lineup. And this year even Ibaka was bad, shooting only 32.6% 3FG. So basically you have 4 horrible shooters around KD. 

How is KD suppose to score efficiently being surrounded by this team?  Just look how much Lebron struggled with the Lakers this year and their lack of shooting. Now multiple that by 10. 

For KD's last 4 years he basically had to suffer with the worst shooting back court of all time. Westbrook and Roberson. Then he was always stuck with a Center who could not do anything beyond 5 feet. Perkins and Adams. Teams could constantly double off of Westbrook and Roberson. And then pack the paint because Perkins and Adams were zero threat. 

Despite this KD still averaged 29 points per game on 57.5% TS in his OKC career. And the only time his TS% dropped below 55% in the playoffs was in 2016 when he had to face a historically great 67-win Spur team and 73-win Warriors team. Both had absolutely amazing defenses.

Who were KD's Starters on OKC?

1. Westbrook - awful 3 point shooter

2. Roberson - literally one of the worst shooters in NBA history

3. Ibaka - decent. But he takes long to shoot. Can't dribble. Can't pass. So teams can close out on him late and provides very little spacing. Ibaka averaged 0.3 made 3-pointers on 35% 3FG in OKC.

1st team
Steph Curry: His ppg is second for all guards also  best record in conference 
James Harden: Revitalized his team that struggled early leads the league in scoring and has had one of the most dominant scoring seasons ever
Paul George: Maybe his best season ever. His defense was excellent as expected 
Giannis Antetokounmpo: His offense improved, he almost shot 60% from the field also lead his team to the best record in the league 
Nikola Jokic: His passing ability is amazing for a center Jokic is great at everything expect for defending but he is leader of a Nuggets team with no playoff experience also doing better in a worse conference 

2nd team
Damian Lillard: The assassin for his team a clutch player with the 2nd best step back shot behind Curry. His defense is suspect but his offensive output makes up for it. 
Klay Thompson: Scored over 20ppg which is impressive because he plays with Curry and Durant. Great defender and shot above 40% from 3.
Kevin Durant: If you need two points he’s the guy. The only reason he isn’t first team is that Giannis and George had career years.
Blake Griffin: A career year that no one was expecting. He doesn’t rely on his athleticism as much and improved his mid range and 3-point shot. Also his passing game was very impressive.
Joel Embiid: Between Jokic and Embiid it was a tough descion because Embiid scored more points and is a better defender. But he only play in 65 games shot below 50% from the field turned the ball over the most on his team and was in a weaker conference with a worst record with debatably worst talent.
3rd team
Russell Westbrook: I almost put Russ second team but OKC collapsed down the stretch and he shot below 30% and you can’t make the excuse he took less shots to help George because they both took around the same amount of shots
Bradley Beal: It was between Beal and Kemba they had very similar shooting stats and neither made the playoffs. I picked Beal because he was a better defender 
Kawhi Leonard: I really wanted to put Kawhi on 2nd team but he just didn’t play enough games. I mean 60 games is pretty disappointing still when he was on the floor he was very impressive.
LeBron James: Like Kawhi did’t play enough games but he also created some much confusion I almost thought of not putting him on but he did play pretty well.
Karl-Anthony Towns: Had a great offensive season shot above 50% from the field and 40% from 3 he just needs to make the playoffs if he ever wants to get above 3rd team

Now obviously the USA are still head and shoulders above the rest of the world, but with the rise of international talent, their path to gold will not be without its hurdles. I would like to look at teams that that can potentially give the USA some trouble. 

**Australia:** 

Notable names: Ben Simmons, Patty Mills, Aron Baynes, Joe Ingles, Dante Exum, Matthew Dellevadova  

To me, Australia is the best team in the world(beside the US ofc) top to bottom. One of the reasons Simmons struggles with the Sixers at times is because of a lack of spacing. AUS has shooters throughout their rosters with even the likes of Baynes being able to knock down long-range shots given the opportunity(3 point line is shorter in FIBA rules). I think they have the best chance of upsetting the USA. 

**Spain:** 

Notable names: Marc Gasol, Serge Ibaka, Nikola Mirotic, Ricky Rubio 

Spain is a  team that has given the US a lot of problems in the past. However, without Pau Gasol, I don't know if their team stacks up to their teams of the past. Still the US should not look past them. 

**Canada:** 

Notable names: Corey Joseph, Andrew Wiggins, Jamaal Murray, Shai Alexander 

One can make a case that on-paper this is most talented international roster. However, the thing that concerns me is their lack of shooting with guys like Wiggins and Alexander not being the best perimeter shooters. The 3 is shorter though. Another concern is Andrew Wiggins' heart of lack thereof. If he doesn't play with a high-motor, I struggle to see how they can medal, yet alone challenge the US. 

**Other interesting teams:** 

**Cameroon** should be interesting to watch with Embiid and Siakam. Not sure if Mbah a Moute will play. Other than those names, I have no idea about the rest of the roster and they probably do not have the depth to compete at a high-level. 

**Greece** to me is the one dark horse that has a good chance to medal. Whenever you have the best player on the floor at all times(imagine how good Giannis will be one year from now) you always have a chance to win the game. I don't know if I would play one of his brothers alongside him due to spacing issues. However, if he develops a solid jumper by next summer, you could put Thannasis at the 5 and create some matchup problems for other teams. Not too sure about the rest of the roster however. 

**Serbia**(silver medalists last olympics) should be a solid contender with the likes of Jokic, Bogdan and Teodosic. They can incorporate some Denver style dribble hand-offs with those guys. 

**Slovenia** is another solid European team with Doncic and Dragic in the backcourt that can cause havoc for the USA.  

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, the competition looks fierce and I have a feeling that the USA will not waltz to a de facto gold medal.

But, I'm guessing there are probably more left handed guards now (especially point guards) than at any prior era in NBA history.  The 2004 hand checking elimination most likely opened up the path some for lefty point guards - offensively and defensively.  At least that's another guess.  Are there stats available to show how left handed guards, especially point guards,  have influenced the overall game of the NBA today compared to years past?

We saw the Raptors go big for stretches of the game, and it worked out great. We were a lot better on the glass, and Serge wasn't a complete offensive liability, getting involved in the post and from mid range. We didn't get as much Gasol high post action as I wanted :( but he was a lot more involved than last game and made some key shots while making plays for others. Now, we could have played better; anyone who watched the game saw that it was down to the wire up until the last minute. We were only up by one before The Shot, and the game could have gone either way. I have some more ideas how our team could play better in Game 5 and get one game away from closing Philly out for good.\n\n## ~~GET~~ STAY BIG\n\nAs I mentioned, our dual big man lineups were great in Game 4. Ibaka is a player who plays at around the same level as his surrounding cast. He can be huge for us if we surround him with the right players. In particular, the main issues for Serge this series are: \n\n1. He cannot guard Embiid 1-on-1. Bites too easily on pump fakes and gets backed down easily by JoJo's power moves deep in the post. Every time Embiid gets deep enough it's curtains for us.\n\n2. He hasn't hit anything from beyond the arc. Philly was literally giving him wide open 3s in game 4 and he airballed one of those shots.\n\n\nWhen Embiid is on the floor, we can either play Gasol, or have Gasol and Ibaka together; we can't leave Ibaka out there 1-on-1, he'll lose every time. When Embiid sits, we should pull Marc out ASAP so we can maximize the amount of JoJo's time is spent with Gasol guarding him. That's the only time we should ever have Ibaka out there alone.\n\nHow should we run our offense with two bigs on the floor who both primarily get buckets through the PnP? When just Gasol is out there, I still think we should ~~continue~~ start feeding him in the high post and letting him initiate more. When both are out there, we'd be better off running Lowry-Ibaka mid range PnP's with Gasol spotting up at the top of the arc. I know Ibaka fell off near the end of this season but if you recall, Ibaka was a BEAST earlier this year when he had a larger role as our starting center. I want to see Serge spotting up from 3 less, he's so much better in the mid range off a PnP or even ((occasionally)) in the post.\n\nDefensively, we should have Gasol as the 5 and Ibaka as the 4 (with it being the other way around on offense). Gasol should be on Embiid at all times, and Serge is a bit more agile and switchable on the perimeter so he's not dead meat if he guards Harris or even Butler.\n\n##What do we do with Siakam then?\n\nWe *could* run a Super Big lineup of Lowry-Kawhi-Siakam-Ibaka-Gasol... In theory, Embiid would have to be on either Ibaka or Gasol in this matchup so he wouldn't be able to clog the paint from Siakam, but with 2 other bigs on the floor, there won't be any space for Siakam to operate and drive to the paint... The Sixers will just switch Embiid onto Siakam as soon as Ibaka or Gasol moves out to the perimeter. Siakam wouldn't fit in well at all with this theoretical big lineup.\n\nNow, we've been having some issues with our backup PG spot... FVV is struggling to create his own offense and he's too small to guard the giants of the Sixers... Siakam is great at creating for himself and has the length and size to guard anybody on the floor... This got me thinking about something I've been wanting to see all season... \n\nWe should seriously let Siakam run PG with the bench unit.\n\nI'm not saying we should bench him right off the bat. Doing that to our young star in a key playoff game would destroy his confidence. We should start with our normal lineup of Lowry-Green-Kawhi-Siakam-Gasol, but take Siakam out of the super big lineup and have Lowry-Green-Kawhi-Ibaka-Gasol instead to add some more spacing.\n\nWhen Embiid is off the floor I really think we could do a ton of damage with lineups that feature Pascal as the main ball-handler and Ibaka at center. Nobody outside that roster outside of Embiid and Simmons can keep Siakam out of the paint. On offense we need to go super fast and run them off the court. With this lineup every single play we should just give the ball to Siakam and let him push the pace up the court and keep the defense on its heels. If they put a big on Siakam they won't be able to keep up with him and if they put someone smaller on him it's BBQ chicken for us.\n\nI wanted to see McCaw more as our backup PG. We can still have him in those lineups, McCaw contributes so much off the ball with his hustle and energy he won't have a problem fitting in.\n\nI hate giving up on players too early and I really wish we could stay patient with FVV but he's been abysmal with his already long leash and this is a must win playoff game. Unless we're up by a ton he shouldn't see the floor.\n\n##Some more wrinkles we can add to our offense\n\nOne play that really caught my attention in Game 4 was when Lowry set a great screen that completely took Embiid out of the play and gave Siakam a wide open lane to the basket. This whole season I feel like we've underutilized Lowry's off ball capabilities. In the past he had to carry a lot more of our offense, but with Kawhi and the emergence of Siakam he can afford to give the ball up and do more when the ball isn't in his hands. We need to run more PnPs with Lowry as the screener, similar to how Golden State runs PnPs with Curry screening for KD instead of the other way around. Lowry is a great screener and an amazing off-ball threat thanks to his shooting ability. With our regular starting lineup we should run more Siakam-Lowry and Kawhi-Lowry PnPs.\n\nEven if Lowry is still on the floor I want to see Siakam more often as the primary ball handler. The Sixers keep doing this pansy bullshit where they put a half-ass full court press on Lowry for 5 seconds then run back. It hasn't created turnovers for them so far but it slows our offense down and runs a second or two off the shot clock when we could alternatively have Spicy P pushing the pace.\n\nAnother thing we can do with Lowry screens is off-ball action with Danny Green. This whole series we haven't done shit to take advantage of and abuse their worst defender in JJ Redick. We can run a basic action on the perimeter with Lowry screening to get Danny Green open. If the Sixers decide to switch, we now have Redick on Lowry and we can even get Redick on someone else if we keep moving the ball. We should constantly be targeting JJ and it's honestly unacceptable that we've done absolutely nothing so far this series with regard to that. \n\n*Side note: One key element of playoff coaching is finding those weaknesses that have been hidden in the regular season and gameplanning to abuse them over and over again. Nurse did a good job coaching in game 4 with his adjustments and time management, but I fear he's not as good of a playoff coach as we need him to be. I just think he still has some of those Casey tendencies with sticking to RS lineups and not adjusting quick enough. He still has room to improve and grow as a coach so I'm not saying we should give up on him, but I'm worried about his ability to gameplan against a Steve Kerr or D'Antoni over a 7 game series. Seriously, Brett fucking Brown was doing a better job than him in Game 3 and even Game 2. Not that Brown's a terrible coach, but a championship caliber coach would be running circles around these guys.*\n\nAnd, as I mentioned before, we should be doing a lot more with Gasol in the high post and letting him initiate offense for everyone. He's an elite passing center so I'm not worried at all if the Sixers try to trap him.\n\n##Defensive adjustments\n\nThese last two posts I've exclusively covered offense. Most of our issues stem from our inability to execute and knock down open shots, but there are some things we can do better on defense as well. First of all, we need to put Kawhi on Jimmy Butler. [I said this before the series began and I'll say it again.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bgyzho/regarding_the_defensive_matchups_in_the/) Why the fuck is Kawhi guarding Simmons? Yes I know he destroyed him in the regular season. But it fucking hurts watching arguably the best perimeter defender in NBA history pressing up on a guy who can't shoot a basketball when 5 feet away Jimmy Buckets is saucing up Kyle Lowry. Lowry and Green have actually played great D on Jimmy so far but he's so fucking good at creating his own shot that he's still managed to carry the Sixers this series. We need to make a change to our D. Jimmy is the only consistent guy on that roster, it's so painfully obvious that even Paul Pierce said it. We should have Kawhi on Jimmy, Green on Redick, Gasol on Embiid, Lowry on Simmons, and Siakam on Harris. Last time I said it everyone was quick to point out that Simmons destroys smaller guards and that he would just go to work in the post. Lowry is a GREAT interior defender on guards. His only defensive weakness is having to contain small, quick 1s who can shoot and get dribble penetration, which unfortunately is the vast majority of starting PGs. Lowry always does great on bigger 2s. If Simmons wants to drive, go ahead. He's playing to Lowry's strengths defensively. If Simmons wants to POST UP for whatever reason, GO AHEAD. Simmons will have trouble backing Lowry down, Lowry has great size for a guard and a low center of gravity. It's not like we need to worry about Simmons rising up and shooting over him anyways. Simmons is a good player, I don't hate on him but I'd much rather have him score a couple points than let Jimmy go to work every possession. \n\nYou know what happens when Lowry guards Jimmy? He's not terrible 1-on-1 but then Jimmy runs a PnR with Embiid, soon as Lowry gets caught on the screen and Jimmy get a little bit of space, Gasol does this dumb shit where he comes up a little bit, not enough to force the ball out of Jimmy's hands but enough to give Embiid space, someone comes to help on Embiid leaving Redick or Harris wide open. We got insanely lucky with Tobi shitting the bed last game. We cannot keep giving him those shots. Gasol needs to stop helping so much off of Embiid. If we have Kawhi on Jimmy there won't be as much pressure off the PnR and Jimmy will have trouble getting dribble penetration making it harder for them to get those open shots.\n\nWe should consider being far more aggressive on defense. Part of what made us such a great team this season was our defense generating turnovers and our outstanding play in transition. Jimmy and Embiid are great 1-on-1 players but I wouldn't describe them as elite playmakers. If we keep Kawhi on Simmons to help him conserve energy for offense, we should trap Jimmy on the perimeter and (maybe)Embiid in the post depending on what type of offense they're running. If we double either of those guys and rotate over, that leaves Redick, Harris, or Simmons (lol) open; However, it's very easy for whoever is right next to them to come over and intercept the pass, especially if they are expecting it. This should be even easier with these guys since Embiid and Butler aren't the sort of playmakers who can consistently make those difficult passes over the course of a full game. Simmons doesn't always cut off ball and we should help more off of him and leave him open instead of having Kawhi press up on him. Even if they manage to score a little off those traps, I'll take that if it means we take Jimmy out of the game.\n\n*We don't need to double Embiid, especially if Gasol is locking him down as usual, but if he's having a good game it wouldn't hurt. If we don't leave Ibaka on Embiid 1-on-1 we won't need to worry about him anyways.*\n\n##Some other notes:\n\n- As I said before, I don't want to give up on FVV yet despite how bad he's been. One of Philly's biggest weaknesses is containing smaller guards, as we saw in Round 1, and if FVV manages to get back into form it could be huge for us. He shouldn't play as much, especially if the game is on the line, but if we completely take him out of the game it'll destroy his confidence and make it even harder for him to bounce back. He's a key part of this team, and although we have an even harder matchup coming up with the length of the Bucks we have to try and get the old Fred back.\n\n- McCaw was great, obviously he didn't put up stellar stats in his limited minutes but just watching him I really want to see this guy play more.

Kawhi doesn't seem to be slowing down at all outside of the outlier flu game, but if he does happen to have an off night it's crucial that the rest of our team pick up the slack. So far Kawhi has had zero issues and there's nothing we need to adjust with regards to him, other than maybe taking a little of the load off his shoulders.\n\n- We need to knock down our open shots, a huge issue for our offense is not executing and converting our open looks into points. It's definitely gone under the radar but holy crap Danny Green has been bad this series. He came up big last game with that one 3 and the clutch free throws to ice the game but outside of that he's been invisible so far.\n\n\n\nLet me know what you guys think, I'd love to hear your feedback in the comments. Go Raptors! We The North!"", 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks like Nick Nurse listened to &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/bkh8fw/oc_the_solutions_to_phillys_defensive_adjustments/""&gt;my previous post&lt;/a&gt;, at least to a certain extent. We saw the Raptors go big for stretches of the game, and it worked out great. We were a lot better on the glass, and Serge wasn&amp;#39;t a complete offensive liability, getting involved in the post and from mid range. We didn&amp;#39;t get as much Gasol high post action as I wanted :( but he was a lot more involved than last game and made some key shots while making plays for others. Now, we could have played better; anyone who watched the game saw that it was down to the wire up until the last minute. We were only up by one before The Shot, and the game could have gone either way. I have some more ideas how our team could play better in Game 5 and get one game away from closing Philly out for good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;del&gt;GET&lt;/del&gt; STAY BIG&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, our dual big man lineups were great in Game 4. Ibaka is a player who plays at around the same level as his surrounding cast. He can be huge for us if we surround him with the right players. In particular, the main issues for Serge this series are: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cannot guard Embiid 1-on-1. Bites too easily on pump fakes and gets backed down easily by JoJo&amp;#39;s power moves deep in the post. Every time Embiid gets deep enough it&amp;#39;s curtains for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He hasn&amp;#39;t hit anything from beyond the arc. Philly was literally giving him wide open 3s in game 4 and he airballed one of those shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Embiid is on the floor, we can either play Gasol, or have Gasol and Ibaka together; we can&amp;#39;t leave Ibaka out there 1-on-1, he&amp;#39;ll lose every time. When Embiid sits, we should pull Marc out ASAP so we can maximize the amount of JoJo&amp;#39;s time is spent with Gasol guarding him. That&amp;#39;s the only time we should ever have Ibaka out there alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How should we run our offense with two bigs on the floor who both primarily get buckets through the PnP? When just Gasol is out there, I still think we should &lt;del&gt;continue&lt;/del&gt; start feeding him in the high post and letting him initiate more. When both are out there, we&amp;#39;d be better off running Lowry-Ibaka mid range PnP&amp;#39;s with Gasol spotting up at the top of the arc. I know Ibaka fell off near the end of this season but if you recall, Ibaka was a BEAST earlier this year when he had a larger role as our starting center. I want to see Serge spotting up from 3 less, he&amp;#39;s so much better in the mid range off a PnP or even ((occasionally)) in the post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Defensively, we should have Gasol as the 5 and Ibaka as the 4 (with it being the other way around on offense). Gasol should be on Embiid at all times, and Serge is a bit more agile and switchable on the perimeter so he&amp;#39;s not dead meat if he guards Harris or even Butler.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What do we do with Siakam then?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; run a Super Big lineup of Lowry-Kawhi-Siakam-Ibaka-Gasol... In theory, Embiid would have to be on either Ibaka or Gasol in this matchup so he wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to clog the paint from Siakam, but with 2 other bigs on the floor, there won&amp;#39;t be any space for Siakam to operate and drive to the paint... The Sixers will just switch Embiid onto Siakam as soon as Ibaka or Gasol moves out to the perimeter. Siakam wouldn&amp;#39;t fit in well at all with this theoretical big lineup.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, we&amp;#39;ve been having some issues with our backup PG spot... FVV is struggling to create his own offense and he&amp;#39;s too small to guard the giants of the Sixers... Siakam is great at creating for himself and has the length and size to guard anybody on the floor... This got me thinking about something I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to see all season... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We should seriously let Siakam run PG with the bench unit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not saying we should bench him right off the bat. Doing that to our young star in a key playoff game would destroy his confidence. We should start with our normal lineup of Lowry-Green-Kawhi-Siakam-Gasol, but take Siakam out of the super big lineup and have Lowry-Green-Kawhi-Ibaka-Gasol instead to add some more spacing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Embiid is off the floor I really think we could do a ton of damage with lineups that feature Pascal as the main ball-handler and Ibaka at center. Nobody outside that roster outside of Embiid and Simmons can keep Siakam out of the paint. On offense we need to go super fast and run them off the court. With this lineup every single play we should just give the ball to Siakam and let him push the pace up the court and keep the defense on its heels. If they put a big on Siakam they won&amp;#39;t be able to keep up with him and if they put someone smaller on him it&amp;#39;s BBQ chicken for us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see McCaw more as our backup PG. We can still have him in those lineups, McCaw contributes so much off the ball with his hustle and energy he won&amp;#39;t have a problem fitting in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hate giving up on players too early and I really wish we could stay patient with FVV but he&amp;#39;s been abysmal with his already long leash and this is a must win playoff game. Unless we&amp;#39;re up by a ton he shouldn&amp;#39;t see the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Some more wrinkles we can add to our offense&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One play that really caught my attention in Game 4 was when Lowry set a great screen that completely took Embiid out of the play and gave Siakam a wide open lane to the basket. This whole season I feel like we&amp;#39;ve underutilized Lowry&amp;#39;s off ball capabilities. In the past he had to carry a lot more of our offense, but with Kawhi and the emergence of Siakam he can afford to give the ball up and do more when the ball isn&amp;#39;t in his hands. We need to run more PnPs with Lowry as the screener, similar to how Golden State runs PnPs with Curry screening for KD instead of the other way around. Lowry is a great screener and an amazing off-ball threat thanks to his shooting ability. With our regular starting lineup we should run more Siakam-Lowry and Kawhi-Lowry PnPs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if Lowry is still on the floor I want to see Siakam more often as the primary ball handler. The Sixers keep doing this pansy bullshit where they put a half-ass full court press on Lowry for 5 seconds then run back. It hasn&amp;#39;t created turnovers for them so far but it slows our offense down and runs a second or two off the shot clock when we could alternatively have Spicy P pushing the pace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing we can do with Lowry screens is off-ball action with Danny Green. This whole series we haven&amp;#39;t done shit to take advantage of and abuse their worst defender in JJ Redick. We can run a basic action on the perimeter with Lowry screening to get Danny Green open. If the Sixers decide to switch, we now have Redick on Lowry and we can even get Redick on someone else if we keep moving the ball. We should constantly be targeting JJ and it&amp;#39;s honestly unacceptable that we&amp;#39;ve done absolutely nothing so far this series with regard to that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Side note: One key element of playoff coaching is finding those weaknesses that have been hidden in the regular season and gameplanning to abuse them over and over again. Nurse did a good job coaching in game 4 with his adjustments and time management, but I fear he&amp;#39;s not as good of a playoff coach as we need him to be. I just think he still has some of those Casey tendencies with sticking to RS lineups and not adjusting quick enough. He still has room to improve and grow as a coach so I&amp;#39;m not saying we should give up on him, but I&amp;#39;m worried about his ability to gameplan against a Steve Kerr or D&amp;#39;Antoni over a 7 game series. Seriously, Brett fucking Brown was doing a better job than him in Game 3 and even Game 2. Not that Brown&amp;#39;s a terrible coach, but a championship caliber coach would be running circles around these guys.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, as I mentioned before, we should be doing a lot more with Gasol in the high post and letting him initiate offense for everyone. He&amp;#39;s an elite passing center so I&amp;#39;m not worried at all if the Sixers try to trap him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Defensive adjustments&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These last two posts I&amp;#39;ve exclusively covered offense. Most of our issues stem from our inability to execute and knock down open shots, but there are some things we can do better on defense as well. First of all, we need to put Kawhi on Jimmy Butler. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bgyzho/regarding_the_defensive_matchups_in_the/""&gt;I said this before the series began and I&amp;#39;ll say it again.&lt;/a&gt; Why the fuck is Kawhi guarding Simmons? Yes I know he destroyed him in the regular season. But it fucking hurts watching arguably the best perimeter defender in NBA history pressing up on a guy who can&amp;#39;t shoot a basketball when 5 feet away Jimmy Buckets is saucing up Kyle Lowry. Lowry and Green have actually played great D on Jimmy so far but he&amp;#39;s so fucking good at creating his own shot that he&amp;#39;s still managed to carry the Sixers this series. We need to make a change to our D. Jimmy is the only consistent guy on that roster, it&amp;#39;s so painfully obvious that even Paul Pierce said it. We should have Kawhi on Jimmy, Green on Redick, Gasol on Embiid, Lowry on Simmons, and Siakam on Harris. Last time I said it everyone was quick to point out that Simmons destroys smaller guards and that he would just go to work in the post. Lowry is a GREAT interior defender on guards. His only defensive weakness is having to contain small, quick 1s who can shoot and get dribble penetration, which unfortunately is the vast majority of starting PGs. Lowry always does great on bigger 2s. If Simmons wants to drive, go ahead. He&amp;#39;s playing to Lowry&amp;#39;s strengths defensively. If Simmons wants to POST UP for whatever reason, GO AHEAD. Simmons will have trouble backing Lowry down, Lowry has great size for a guard and a low center of gravity. It&amp;#39;s not like we need to worry about Simmons rising up and shooting over him anyways. Simmons is a good player, I don&amp;#39;t hate on him but I&amp;#39;d much rather have him score a couple points than let Jimmy go to work every possession. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You know what happens when Lowry guards Jimmy? He&amp;#39;s not terrible 1-on-1 but then Jimmy runs a PnR with Embiid, soon as Lowry gets caught on the screen and Jimmy get a little bit of space, Gasol does this dumb shit where he comes up a little bit, not enough to force the ball out of Jimmy&amp;#39;s hands but enough to give Embiid space, someone comes to help on Embiid leaving Redick or Harris wide open. We got insanely lucky with Tobi shitting the bed last game. We cannot keep giving him those shots. Gasol needs to stop helping so much off of Embiid. If we have Kawhi on Jimmy there won&amp;#39;t be as much pressure off the PnR and Jimmy will have trouble getting dribble penetration making it harder for them to get those open shots.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We should consider being far more aggressive on defense. Part of what made us such a great team this season was our defense generating turnovers and our outstanding play in transition. Jimmy and Embiid are great 1-on-1 players but I wouldn&amp;#39;t describe them as elite playmakers. If we keep Kawhi on Simmons to help him conserve energy for offense, we should trap Jimmy on the perimeter and (maybe)Embiid in the post depending on what type of offense they&amp;#39;re running. If we double either of those guys and rotate over, that leaves Redick, Harris, or Simmons (lol) open; However, it&amp;#39;s very easy for whoever is right next to them to come over and intercept the pass, especially if they are expecting it. This should be even easier with these guys since Embiid and Butler aren&amp;#39;t the sort of playmakers who can consistently make those difficult passes over the course of a full game. Simmons doesn&amp;#39;t always cut off ball and we should help more off of him and leave him open instead of having Kawhi press up on him. Even if they manage to score a little off those traps, I&amp;#39;ll take that if it means we take Jimmy out of the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We don&amp;#39;t need to double Embiid, especially if Gasol is locking him down as usual, but if he&amp;#39;s having a good game it wouldn&amp;#39;t hurt. If we don&amp;#39;t leave Ibaka on Embiid 1-on-1 we won&amp;#39;t need to worry about him anyways.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Some other notes:&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I said before, I don&amp;#39;t want to give up on FVV yet despite how bad he&amp;#39;s been. One of Philly&amp;#39;s biggest weaknesses is containing smaller guards, as we saw in Round 1, and if FVV manages to get back into form it could be huge for us. He shouldn&amp;#39;t play as much, especially if the game is on the line, but if we completely take him out of the game it&amp;#39;ll destroy his confidence and make it even harder for him to bounce back. He&amp;#39;s a key part of this team, and although we have an even harder matchup coming up with the length of the Bucks we have to try and get the old Fred back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCaw was great, obviously he didn&amp;#39;t put up stellar stats in his limited minutes but just watching him I really want to see this guy play more.

Kawhi doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be slowing down at all outside of the outlier flu game, but if he does happen to have an off night it&amp;#39;s crucial that the rest of our team pick up the slack.

I compare this to the days when Jordan was playing the Knicks. What if the Knicks won the title? Then the whole league would adapt bully ball. What a horrible thing that would be.

But I see a similiar event if Houston wins. Houston's strategy is to jack up as many 3's as possible. Bait as many foul shots as possible. Isolation heavy. No ball movement or player movement. The entire offense comes down to isolating Harden on the players worse defender. If they send a double he kicks out to a wide open 3 point shooter. Literally 8 out of 10 players on the court are standing around doing nothing.

Is this REALLY the type of basketball we want to see?  Houston basketball is basically a glorified One on One game. Except its Houston's best player versus your worst. 

IMO, this truly would be a DARK AGE in the NBA. Teams would be constantly jacking up 3 pointers no matter how bad the shots are. 90% of possessions will be isolation. No player movement. No ball movement. No post game. No mid range game. Nothing.

All season different analysts, as well as this thread seem to have had Kyrie as a consensus 2nd team pick, and top 10 player over Westbrook. This sentiment grew to an all time high obviously when Russ lost to Portland, but now that it seems like Kyrie's team will lose to Milwaukee, can anyone explain the reasoning for this to me? 

&amp;#x200B;

Kyrie is not a leader. He played well as Lebron's #2 and hit maybe the biggest clutch shot of all time, but I feel like that really inflated his image. He gets a pass for getting nowhere prior to Lebron going back to Cleveland, but since then what has he done? Kyrie and KEVIN LOVE together had a losing record in Cleveland whenever Lebron sat or took games off. Now that Kyrie has arrived in Boston, he isn't really playing any better than he did in Cleveland, and caused a ton of locker room drama this season. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that this year Milwaukee, Philly, Toronto, and Indiana all got significantly better, but still, the Celtics literally had a worse record this season than the previous two, one without Kyrie, and the other with Isaiah Thomas. Without him, the Celtics had a better winning percentage this year, and went to the conference finals the last two years, last year going to game 7. This year, Kyrie seemed to get a lot of praise for sweeping the Pacers in the first round, except #1 they didn't have Oladipo, #2 it was still a close series. If Indiana had Oladipo, they would have finished with a better regular season record, and I'm not sure would have lost to the Celtics in the playoffs. 

&amp;#x200B;

So since winning the Indiana series doesn't really count, and the Celtics will most likely lose to Milwaukee, what exactly makes Kyrie a top 10 player? What exactly puts him above Russ? Russ this postseason averaged 23-11-9 on 36% shooting, and Kyrie is averaging 22-8-5 on 39% shooting. The biggest argument against Russ was that he hasn't led a team to playoff success since KD leaving, which is fair, but Kyrie hasn't had playoff success on his own either. Kyrie I'd say has equal talent surrounding him, more even if Hayward were healthy. After last season people kept saying Tatum and Brown would become all stars, Tatum is better than Simmons etc, and Horford is an all star. If you surrounded either Kyrie or Russ with total garbage, I believe Russ can carry them further, but so far if you surround each with talent, Kyrie doesn't seem like he can take them further either. 

&amp;#x200B;

Players in any order I'd put above Kyrie, 1. Lebron 2. Kawhi 3. Giannis 4. Harden 5. Embiid 6. Durant 7. Dame 8. Steph 9. Paul George 10. Anthony Davis 11. Westbrook 12. Blake Griffin.  Honestly I'm not even sure Kyrie is better than Oladipo or Klay Thompson at the guard position. All this might seem like I'm a Kyrie hater but I'm really not, I just haven't seen anything from him beyond his success with Lebron and flashy plays.

I thought this article brought up some good points about how we talk about different coaches around the league. So much of our discussions about coaches are result based (or meme based). While coaches like Brett Brown might not be great or elite coaches, they are often treated like they do nothing or have a negative impact. 

Average coaches are still capable of making adjustments. Steve Clifford was considered a bad coach but he was able to take a flawed Orlando team to the playoffs. Frank Vogel was unable to do so and he was considered a good coach.

So today I\'m going to adjust the scoring of Dirk and Kobe to today\'s points per game and relative TS%.** Per 100 Stats do a good job here but I decided to take the % of points scored for an average team during these years instead and apply them to the 2018/2019 season. League average TS% used to be a lot lower than today\'s NBA, so we\'re trying to adjust for this as well. The following stats are of course flawed and you can\'t easily translate a player\'s game to a different era just like that. **This is just supposed to add some context to their scoring, making it easier to grasp just how amazing these 2 players were. We\'re going to take a closer look from 2000-2010. So let\'s get started!**\n#**Overall Performance:**\n\n**Teams in the 2000s were scoring 97.2 points per game on average. League average TS sits at 53% over these 10 seasons.** Let\'s compare this to Dirk\'s and Kobe\'s PPG and shooting splits.\n\n**Over 10 seasons Dirk scored 24,3 PPG at 58,4%TS**\n\n**Over 10 seasons Kobe scored 28,4 PPG at 55,5%TS**\n\nAs we can see Kobe and Dirk both scored at a high rate with above league average shooting during this span. Kobe has a bigger emphasis on volume scoring while Dirk was considerably more efficient. So let\'s apply these numbers to this year\'s regular season!\n\n**Teams in 2018/2019 were scoring 111.2 points per game on average. League average TS sits at 56% this year.** Let\'s check what Dirk\'s and Kobe\'s numbers would look today using this data:\n\n##In 2019 an average Dirk season would translate to **27,8 PPG at 61,4%TS**\n\n##In 2019 an average Kobe season would translate to **31,5 PPG at 58,5%TS**\n\n#**Conclusion:**\n\nWe all knew it but Kobe and Dirk were absolutely terrific scorers. **An average Dirk season in the 2000s translates to great Durant/Curry season in today\'s game. Kobe adds even more points while still boasting good shooting overall. Kobe\'s ""Chucker""-image seems to be wrong in all regards - Dirk\'s overall scoring being a tad below the greatest scorers ever seems to be incorrect at the very least as well given the league was more defensive minded back then.** We have to note that we didn\'t adjust for today\'s pace/possessions played and the respective teams Dirk and Kobe played for. This set of data only gives us a rough overview of what Dirk and Kobe would be capable of doing on an average Team in the 2000s era and today\'s league. But we\'re not done yet! **Let\'s take a look at some peak performances by Kobe and Dirk in the 2000s and translate this using the same method.**\n\n#**MVP Seasons:**\n\n#Dirk:\n\n**2006/2007 PPG + TS%: 98,7 PPG | 54,1%TS**\n\n**Dirk\'s scoring + TS%: 24,6 PPG | 60,5%TS**\n\n##Adjusted data 2019: **27,3 PPG | 62,5%TS**\n\n#Kobe:\n\n**2007/2008 PPG + TS%: 99,9PPG | 54%TS**\n\n**Kobe\'s scoring + TS%: 28,3 PPG | 57,6%TS**\n\n##Adjusted data 2019: **31,5 PPG | 59,6%TS**\n\n#Conclusion:\n\nBoth of these seasons would still hold up really well today. What\'s standing out, though, is Kobe\'s stellar performance in his MVP year, combining insane volume with elite efficiency. Truly one of the all-time great seasons. Meanwhile Dirk played like KD on a Roster without 20 All-Stars. We could wrap it up here but let\'s take a look at just one more outlier season of these players as both Dirk and Kobe had seasons in the 2000s which could be considered better than their MVP years.\n\n#More Peak Performances: 2005/2006 season\n\n**2005/2006 PPG and TS%: 97 PPG | 53,6%TS**\n\n**Dirk\'s scoring + TS%: 26,6 PPG | 58.9%TS**\n\n**Kobe\'s scoring + TS%: 35,4 PPG | 55,9%TS**\n\n##Adjusted Data Dirk 19: **30,5 PPG | 61%TS**\n\n##Adjusted Data Kobe 19: **40,5 PPG | 58,3%TS**\n\n#Conclusion:\n\nAlright Kobe\'s season would probably be considered the GOAT scoring seasons if it happened today. These numbers are straight up insane, especially if you consider he maintained a solid TS% over this season. It\'s hard to imagine that something like this could happen today, you\'d have to put someone like Prime KD or Harden on a trash team and give them the will and endurance of Kobe in order to accomplish something like this. It doesn\'t seem possible tbh. Dirk\'s season meanwhile can be compared to a peak Harden season, even though he scored a lot on midrange jumpers and didn\'t play the super efficient Morey-Ball which is a stunning feat, too.\n\nOverall this was a lot of fun to do. Dirk\'s scoring is the epitome of sustained excellence, easily holding up with today\'s most efficient scorers in an era which didn\'t rely on advanced metrics and scoring knowledge while also being rather defensive-minded as well. Kobe on the other hand has a little more fluctuation to his scoring game but his absolute peak would be considered impossible if we applied our little experiment to today\'s league. These 2 are truly some of the very best scorers this game has ever seen - they aren\'t worse than Curry, Durant or Harden in that regard. They even have a solid argument to be better than those players as Dirk and Kobe did this over 10+ years (Dirk held up similar numbers up until the 2015/2016 started with one slightly weaker year in 2013, Kobe didn\'t fall off until the 2013/2014 season) while being surrounded with Teams that weren\'t as stacked as the Warriors, OKC or the Houston Rockets. Again there\'s a lot more to it and we can\'t know how Dirk and Kobe would actually fare in today\'s league.

Make no mistake Kerr has done amazing things turning around the Warriors in 2014-2015. They went from a stagnant iso offense to a historical offense. But look at his performances in the playoffs:

2015 - Best record in the league. Got pushed hard by Grizzlies to 6 games. Then in the Finals he allowed a 1-man team of Lebron to push them to 6 games. Not exactly elite coaching. In fact it was one of the assistants who suggested starting Iguadala not Kerr.

2016 - Debacle. Kerr got massively out coached by a Rookie in OKC. They should have lost that series in 6 games if not for Klay going God mode. A 73-win team losing to a 55 win team would be embarrasing. Kerr was extremely slow in making adjustments to take advantage of OKC's weaknesses ( Kanter's defense and Roberson's offense). Then in the next series he losses to the Cavs, which is one of the biggeset upsets in Playoff history.

2017 - Warriors mow down everyone going 16-1. Not much coaching needed. Hell it was Coach Brown who basically coached that team the entire way with Kerr out because of illness till the Finals.

2018 - Warriors were a literally a shot or an injury (CP3) from become the biggest upset in playoff history. They barely won in 7. Kerr would literally have been on the wrong side of 2 of the biggest upsets of all time in 3 years.

2019 - Team has been stagnant all year. And if they lose to Houston it would be another massive upset.


The very fact that Steve Kerr is on the wrong side of so many historic upsets is troubling.  How can his teams constantly under-perform (except in 2017) and be on the razor's edge of getting upset?

If the Warriors lose to Houston, Kerr would be on the wrong side of 2 of the biggest upsets of all time. And without the CP3 injury it would have been THREE of the biggest upsets of all time in FOUR YEARS.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,33587,public,self,Is Steve Kerr a poor Playoff Coach?,0,1557563043,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/blrsny/is_steve_kerr_a_poor_playoff_coach/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I wanted to see what people here think.

The social media and hot take content  scene has reduced ""best"" player discussions to arguments and statistics  that are grounded in a player's individual isolated contributions to  team success. Deep down we all know that discussions in these terms  really do not make much sense, a player's success is within the context  of a team structure with defined offensive and defensive systems.   Furthermore, we all know that the metrics we all use to compare players  are incomplete, they cannot possibly calculate all of the facets of  basketball that contribute to team success. Shane Battier is the  canonical example of a player who makes large contributions to team  success by excelling at aspects of basketball that are hard to measure  and which also contribute to team success. He eloquently presents this  in a [long seminar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOgNqSi17oQ).  One take away from this seminar is things like diving for loose balls,  running back on defense, creating space for better players (or just  creating space), moving the ball, setting screens, taking charges,  boxing out, embracing what analytics says about an opponent's  weaknesses, and trying to keep team morale up are all very important for  winning, and most players do not want to excel at them.

In  the presence of all of this complication, what does ""best"" player even  mean? IMO LeBron James or Michael Jordan are the ""best"" to ever lace  them up in terms of their isolated individual contributions to team  success. That being said, I am hesitant to include them on a ""best""  all-time team\* provided that I get to form my team by choosing among all  of the players who ever played. Simply put,  IMO these players are not  truly team friendly, selfless, enthusiastic to adapt, or coachable. I  cannot see LeBron or MJ embracing an offensive system which does not  feature them as the alpha primary player with clear separation from the  other players. IMO the best version of any system centered around any  alpha player is worse than the best possible system which embraces the  strengths of all five players on the court and distributes the offensive  load in a uniform manner. The latter team construction would likely not  include LeBron or MJ in its best form. Of course this is a subject for  debate, my opinion is not even close to the final word on the topic. The  point here is that the conversation of the greatest players should  include more context around them, emphasis should be given regarding how  the best players play within the context of team structure and real or  hypothetical teammates. Era and rule changes should also be given  emphasis (this also could be discussed at length but I'm not interested  in doing so here).

Note that I am not  including my all-time starting lineup here because I fear that it would  distract attention away from the conversation that I am trying to have. I  realize that it may be frustrating to read a dense post with no  answers.

They win, but the more I think about it the less impressed I am with their post-season successes. KD joining already makes me view it as almost too easy, but a lot of the series have run close or run closer than they appear. Steph’s all-time great 3pt years were insane to me but that sense of wonder and otherworldliness hasn’t translated into the post-season for me. Let’s take a look at their runs.

2015 (67-15): sweeps Pels, goes down 2-1 to Grizzlies, 4-1 Rockets, 4-2 against a Loveless and Kyrieless Cavs. They win here but with Love and Kyrie this easily could’ve been a different story.

2016 (73-9): 4-1 Houston, 4-1 Portland, goes down 3-1 to Thunder, blows 3-1 lead to the Cavs. Obviously a disasterous post season flop, not only due to blowing a 3-1 but also from nearly being eliminated in WCF, although credit due for comeback

This is obviously where KD joins and things are a whole lot less competitive, but they’re still semi-human and not as good as they should be imo

2017 (67-15): sweep Portland, sweep Jazz, sweep Spurs (were down big before Kawhi injury, although still probably Warriors series), 4-1 Cavs, but eye test says a couple of those games were closer than thought, still this is obviously GSW peak

2018 (58-24): 4-1 Spurs, 4-1 Pels, 4-3 Rockets (Chris Paul injury + historically bad 3pt shooting in game 7 makes me look at this one questionably), sweeps Cavs, JR game 1 blunder, but this was still going to be over fairly quickly

2019 (57-25): 4-2 Clips, 2-2 Rockets

Maybe I’m just overrrating other dynasties and overlooking the series’ that they nearly dropped (or did drop) but the Warriors dynasty have ‘struggled’ relative to what we’d expect from a team with 4 all stars who happen to be made up of 2 of the best 3 shooters of all time (one of which is an MVP and the best shooter ever), one of the best scorers ever who is also an MVP, and a DPOY point forward.

The offense just needs to change. Russ p&amp;r was ran so much in playoffs and only had 0.66 PPP. Essentially OKC offense had no cuts.

Okc with brooks used to have Nick collision get ball in mid range. There would be Kevin Martin or Durant running and head fake from going to 3 and instead to rim. The cut leads to easy buckets.

Adams has alot of potential if he can get the ball in mid range and post up area.

He can also setup great screens in the paint.

The way OKC has played is just not the right way to play. Russ controlling the offense by rebounding the ball should be much less.

Russ needs to be used more in off ball scenarios. Hell he was so great in 2012 and 2013 playing off ball. Now he just stands 5 feet from 3 point line.

I don't understand why the coach doesn't innovate on the offense. He doesn't move Russ around on offense. Russ should be running off screens or cutting to the hope more often.

This reminded me of Igor Kokoskov and his firing. 

The reasons he was fired were reasons that always get brought up against foreign coaches, “He can’t connect to the players”, “The players won’t understand him”, and “There’ll be a culture gap”. It really looks like any time someone wants to argue against a foreign coach they can point to the Suns and Igor. Believe it or not the amount of European coaches that have gotten head coach jobs in the NBA are very very few and a lot of them were raised in the US. Igor was basically like a test run of a foreign coach in the NBA and the results don’t look good.(Also see David Blatt). Another critique was how he utilized our big man Deandre Ayton, where Ayton got fewer touches than he deserved(although I point to our lack of a real point guard). 

I just thought this was very interesting and one of the reasons I made this was because of a YouTube video about this coach in the euroleague(?) who has gotten some traction(his name might be Sarunas(?)). In one clip he’s yelling at his player for not wasting enough time even though he scored a 3 when they were up 4/5 and I just thought that would never fly in the NBA. Any thoughts?

He was a very skilled point forward type of player who could do just about anything on the court. Solid defender, good shooter, good finisher in the paint, excellent at drawing fouls, and overall just a very selfless player. His confidence grew year after year, and with the right coach in Quin Snyder, he was able to crush expectations after signing a max-offer sheet after a troublesome year putting up 16-5-5 as the first option on a bad Jazz squad. He elevated his game into an All-Star caliber forward, who was able to do everything on the court that you could ask for, including scoring at a high level.

There's no doubt though that Snyder helped Hayward progress into an All-Star, as he meticulously crafted an offense around him that enabled him to handle the rock roughly 70-80% of his time on the floor. Yes, there was a revolving door of point guards in Hayward's tenure with the Jazz, guys like George Hill, Mo Williams, Trey Burke, Shelvin Mack, etc. But none of those guys were great playmakers for a point guard, they were more of supportive guards for Hayward's point forward tendencies.

Now in Boston, obviously he had a major career-threatening injury in his first game, but ever since coming back, his role with the Celtics is absolutely nothing like the one he had in Utah. He's often passing around the perimeter, spotting up on the three point line, and when he does drive, he's not finishing at the rim as he used to. Obviously, the injury may have hindered his confidence when it comes to driving and finishing at the rack, but it almost looks like it's in the gameplan for him *not* to try and finish, or create his own shots. He honestly just doesn't even look like the same player out there, he looks more like a Tony Snell.

[Here is his playoff series against the Clippers a couple years back](https://youtu.be/UKzT_1nSP6Y?t=17)

Notice how often he's creating his *own* shot, taking the initiative and either driving to the basket, drawing fouls, or pulling up for a jumpshot. He's more comfortable when he's able to get his own shot, and get his own rhythm, but with the Celtics, he just simply doesn't have the opportunity to do this with guys like Kyrie, Tatum, Brown, and Rozier all handling the ball more than he does.

Even Pop struggled coaching LMA offensively and Kawhi to some degrees. If you get to a certain level in your field, you're going to be stubborn and hard headed.

Also, you can't expect a coach to bench their star player if they're playing poorly and that star player to not be mad. I've seen people say that Kerr should've sat Curry in OT in game 3.

This is the dead straight truth. If I could draft either a 19 year old Lebron or 19 year old Duncan, I take Duncan every time. The reason?  Duncan is the better defender, winner, leader, and franchise cornerstone.

Better Winner. Duncan made the playoffs every single year. 18 years in a row. And won 50 games every single year. The Spurs were contenders literally every single year Duncan played. And this was true even though Duncan played in the much tougher West. Duncan also has 5 Rings.

Duncan is the better defender. Having a defensive anchor is essential to win titles. Duncan made All NBA defense 15x. Lebron only 5x. Plus interior defense is much more valuable then individual perimeter defense. 

Duncan is a better leader. When was there every drama in the Spurs locker room with Duncan? Never. There never was agendas. It was all about winning. That was Duncan. Its no coincidence that after Duncan retired the Kawhi drama happened. Now look at Lebron's teams. Drama every single year. Agenda's that are more important then winning. 

Duncan is the better franchise cornerstone. This cannot be denied. Lebron has never contended on the same team for more then 4 years. After 4 years the environment gets so toxic. The Cavs contended from 2006-2010. Then it blew up. Miami from 2010-2014. Then it blew up. The Cavs 2.0 from 2014-2018. Then it blew up. Nothing was sustainable. The teams would sacrifice there entire future to win now. They would trade away all their draft picks and young assets. They would overpay for veterans (JR Smith, TT). Of course after 4 years you have to pay the piper. 

Now look at Duncan. The Spurs were contenders for 18 straight years with Duncan. 18. years. In a row. Compare that to 4 years with Lebron. The Spurs didn't throw away their future to win now. They didn't do reckless moves that jeopardized their future to win in a small window. Yet they still contended for 18 straight years.

If you draft Lebron he's going to leave in 7 years. If you draft Duncan you will contend for 2 decades. Its pretty obvious who I'm drafting.

I thought it would be very interesting to see other people’s basketball opinion &amp; see what different lineups that y’all can come up with. Let’s keep this respectful and fun.



PG: Steph Curry - I know people might crucify me for taking him over magic but he’s more of a threat on the court than magic and he can facilitate an offense very well. His defense might not be the best but it’s good enough to make this team a championship contender. The way steph spreads the floor due to his deadly shot will make the offense within this team to flow much better than magic Johnson would with his lack of a perimeter jump shot. 

SG: Micheal Jordan - Not much to be said about MJ as we all know him to be the greatest player of all time. No other player will out edge Jordan at the SG position; not even Kobe Bryant. 


SF: Lebron James - Again not much to be said but unquestionably the greatest SF to ever step foot on the court there’s nobody I’m taking over LBJ at the SF position. You could argue other great SF’s such as bird but in my personal opinion they’re not edging Lebron James. 

PF:  Kevin Durant - Like with me taking Steph over Magic I KNOW people are going to be like wtf KD is a SF &amp; why would you take him over a Duncan or a dirk for that matter. I’ll explain why. While I understand the greatness of a Tim Duncan or a dirk there’s no way on gods green earth I’m taking them EVEN AT THE PF POSITION over KD. KD is an excellent two way player (whether or not you want to acknowledge his defense or not) &amp; he has a better perimeter game and a good post up game to be a perimeter player. Not to mention he has the height to play the PF position with generational scoring talent. He shows up on the biggest stages and he rarely crumbles under pressure. He is a perfect fit for this run, gun, &amp; defend type of offense that this starting 5 presents. 


C: Hakeem Olajuwon - Now if you don’t know about Hakeem or ever done your proper research on him don’t call this pick outrageous. For the offense I have set up Hakeem fits more perfectly than any center to ever play basketball. He’s versatile, excellent defense and excellent offense. Despite any height desparity I would put him up against any center of all time and be confident he would take the series. He’s outplayed some of the greatest centers of all time such as shaq, Kareem, and David Robinson &amp; came out on top against them. His perimeter shot is good enough  and he is a midrange sniper. Like with KD he doesn’t shy from pressure and lives for the big moments as well so the intangibles are definitely there. 



All of these 5 are in their respective primes and at full health. 

I also would like to preface that this starting 5 would win in any era’s set of rules. 


It would be interesting to see what 5 you have beating this lineup and why. I’m not saying that these are the greatest 5 players of all time I’m just saying that I don’t believe that this all time starting 5 would lose in a 4 game series to any starting 5 of your choice.

Nevertheless, I want to briefly discuss something interesting that I thought Steph did well at over the course of the first three games. If this is not that day for you, feel free to bail now. I will not blame you.

Steph Curry, while improving to the point of being an average defender in the league, is still not the strongest on ball defender. He struggles in isolation, and his lack of physical gifts limit his iso defense ability. Because of the makeup of the Warriors team, and their collection of dominant individual defenders, Steph is nearly always the weakest link on the court. As we all knew before the series, and as we can all see once the series began, this has made Curry the isolation target of maybe the best isolation player we’ve seen in 20 years. The Rockets knew they wanted to put Curry in iso situations. The Warriors know it. We know. Everyone knows it. Dread it, run from it, 15 dancing dribbles, a drive and a trip to the foul line or lay up will be the Endgame of every single one of these Harden against Curry isolations. As was pointed out by Zack Lowe in his article before the series started ([Seriously, take a look at this] (http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26056184/how-james-harden-relentlessly-attacks-steph-curry). It’s staggering)if James Harden gets Steph Curry switched onto him, he goes into Isolation at a rate that reminds you of a basketball movie when the best player puts the team on his back in montage form.

So naturally Coach Mike has devised a system to get Steph switched onto James as much as possible. We have all seen the primary way they accomplish this goal; through pick and rolls with whomever Curry is guarding, forcing the Warriors, who play switch defense as often as possible, to end up with Curry on Harden. Sometimes Curry avoids this by switching with someone else as his man goes up to set the screen. But sometimes, getting put in a Harden pick and roll is unavoidable. After a 7 game series last year of targeting Curry like he’s a sub-par Cornerback who keeps getting burned on the outside, I was excited to see what adjustment Kerr and Curry would dream up.
They have not disappointed, even though it hasn’t worked every play. Let's take a look at what they have been doing.

The first thing to recognize is that the Warriors are avoiding switching Harden pick and rolls with Curry as the target as frequently as possible. Instead, for that matchup, they are playing traditional PnR defense. For those of us that watched last season’s matchup, which featured more defensive switches for both teams than I’ve ever seen in my life, this is a massive stylistic change. But what is interesting and what I want to talk about is the choice Steph and Kerr have made within the context of those PnRs.

**DISCLAIMER**

I’m about to give a quick overview of traditional pick and roll defense. I’m going to keep it really basic and not talk about permutations. If you played organized basketball into High School, you will probably know all of this (though you still might find it interesting). If you understand PnR defense, you might know all of this. So please feel free to skip down to Disclaimer End to get to the next part if you don't want a refresher on PnR styles.

There are 5 traditional styles of PnR defense. Some people call them different things in different places, but I know them as such: Hedge, Show, Drop, Switch, Trap/Blitz.

The Styles favored by Big-Little defense (where one defender is a guard or wing and one defender is a slower big man) are Hedge, Show, and drop. Hedge is when you see the second defender (who’s man is the screener) jump above the PnR and bump the ball handler, while a third defender helps on the roller. Then the defender runs back to his man. This style is favored when the roller will roll rather than pop. Show is similar, but instead of coming all the way up, the second defender shows enough of himself to deter the ball handler, then runs back quickly towards his man. This style is more common when stretch 4's are the screeners. Lot’s of teams run these styles.

Drop style, (favored by teams like Philly with Embiid and Milwaukee with Lopez) involves the secondary defender staying below the PnR and trying to force the ball handler into a mid-range jump shot. This is becoming increasingly popular in the NBA, but fails against a few types of players who have specific skills to counter it (KD, LeBron, Curry)

The ones favored by guard-based pick and rolls (where neither defender is a Big Man and are both mobile) are Switch and Trap/Blitz. Switch is self-explanatory: The two players switch match-ups. Trap is also pretty obvious. The two defenders both trap the Ball Handler and try and force him into a turnover. Blitz is an aggressive version of the Trap where the secondary defender shoots the side of the pick going for a quick steal or other turnover. It’s pretty much a crazy aggressive trap predicated on getting steals for quick transition. If you ever saw teams try and run a Pick and Roll against Jordan and Pippen, they used to murder people with this. (Olympics Toni Kukoc is still scarred.) Later, it famously became the identity of one of the best defenses of the past 20 years: The 2011-2014 Miami Heat. Wade, LeBron and Bosh blitzing PnR was one of the scariest things one could ever see. So much length. So much athleticism. So much speed. And sooo much recovery ability when it failed.

**END DISCLAIMER**

Back to the Warriors. Kerr had to figure out what to do about Harden attacking Steph on the PnR. They can’t switch. They sure as shit can’t blitz. And I would burst out laughing if he tried to play drop PnR Defense. So what would the plan be? What seems to have happened is Steph has started to run PnR defense as the secondary defender as if he is a 6’11 medium athletic long big man!
Check out the two PnR’s with about 5:18 left in the game, and again with 2:15 left in the game as just three examples (there are tons of other instances I’m sure you all saw.) Kerr is having Steph hedge and show as the two PnR defensive choices! Not only is this fascinating because Steph’s man is popping not rolling, so he has no help from a third defender, but hedging and showing work because they cut off passing lanes because of the big mans long arms who are usually doing the hedge, and force the offense into a temporary pause. Steph isn’t tall enough for that! He’s not a major deterrence to Harden in theory, and can't really cut off passing lanes. But there he goes, showing or hedging and sprinting back to his man, using his strong anticipation, technique and quickness to recover (as well as using the fact that Austin Rivers isn’t that scary).

Now it’s not crazy uncommon to see small players play defense like this. But because it’s not what they are often used to, they often do a bad job of using techniques that big men are taught from the day they turn 12. SO often you see players unnecessarily jumping at the ball handler during the hedge. Staying too long on a show and not being able to get back. Not staying long enough thereby failing to become a deterrent for the ball handler and using awkward footwork and going for steals instead of keeping there hands up and using short precise movement to recover.

Steph does an excellent job here. He shows well or hedges hard, he doesn’t go for steals, keeps his eyes on his primary, and excellently times his release to get back to his man with short efficient movements. He Creates a real deterrent for Harden while refusing to get caught switched onto him where he knows he will get burnt like a Frozen Pizza warming up in the oven at 3:30am by your drunk friend in his apartment (God fucking damnit Scott, every fucking time.) This is so small, but such excellent D for a player who likely has never heavily utilized these techniques. I've seen Steph play defense like this over the course of the season here and there. But not like this. Lot’s of guards try to do this. Few use leg movement sliding, and hedge techniques quite like Steph. Truthfully, it probably helps that he’s been picked on in PnR for so much of his career.

I don’t want to overstate the importance here. It’s still just a minor play using his head and training, and Steph must fix A LOT of things to get back to the MVP level he must play at for the Warriors to win these series in 5 instead of winning in 6 or 7.

Jokes aside, Curry’s ability to play such strong non-switch, secondary defender Pick and Roll defense has opened up entirely new options for GSW defense on James Harden’s isolation onslaught. If there are even 4 or 5 more possessions per game where the Warriors can have Andre Iguodala, Kevin Durant or Klay Thompson guarding James Harden, rather than Steph Curry, that can very well be the difference in the game and by extension the series.

**TL:DR Steph Curry has done an excellent job of using big man PnR defense techniques to prevent himself from getting switched onto too many James Harden isolations. Kerr’s design to have him show and hedge have countered Mike Dantoni’s Isolation attacks. This has opened up options for the Warriors defense, and helped them keep James out of shooting rhythm (though the Beard naturally still gets his!)**",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,32886,public,self,"Analysis of the Pick and Roll chess match between the Houston Offense and Golden State Defense: A Study of Steve Kerr Choices, Mike Dantoni and James Harden calculated attacks, and the attempted target, Steph Curry, performing admirably by emulating giants.",0,1557536555,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/bl07xj/analysis_of_the_pick_and_roll_chess_match_between/,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'uZiZvcZc8FLCz8cZ0n6pIrVc9lWb1oweCgRb-7F4Yjo', 'resolutions': [{'height': 60, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/edwN2lJgonvufOD2IOp3qrZfPjALsai1afJSvZcCDHM.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70ad49e30c5bc85fa2daa7669f7054f8ce991be0', 'width': 108}, {'height': 121, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/edwN2lJgonvufOD2IOp3qrZfPjALsai1afJSvZcCDHM.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55d37af920c62c046374029b93095c6689f4be6e', 'width': 216}, {'height': 180, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/edwN2lJgonvufOD2IOp3qrZfPjALsai1afJSvZcCDHM.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8bebb3906416a55ebd882dd2495092cfc736b18', 'width': 320}, {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/edwN2lJgonvufOD2IOp3qrZfPjALsai1afJSvZcCDHM.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbc12c40b56666907a6eb48b0369931988929f34', 'width': 640}, {'height': 540, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/edwN2lJgonvufOD2IOp3qrZfPjALsai1afJSvZcCDHM.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8bc54b1dc540d0ab1ca4d901b4d318e03b1fb3f', 'width': 960}, {'height': 607, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/edwN2lJgonvufOD2IOp3qrZfPjALsai1afJSvZcCDHM.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d2267b1ac4d86f1de5c61cc237fc01063ede39a', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 729, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/edwN2lJgonvufOD2IOp3qrZfPjALsai1afJSvZcCDHM.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=007a5dc57bd2ed56afd0aa150d2045eea234485d', 'width': 1296}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,

After that he’s fallen to pieces, taken 5 less shots per game than in the RS, been consistently in foul trouble (although it’s affected his minutes) and had a couple nagging injuries including that awkward looking dislocation.

His agent and business partner, Rich Kleiman, has Knick connections. The media noise has been him to the Knicks. He’s signed 1-year deals the last three years, but has said he wants to be paid this offseason, which would signify a long-term deal being signed. He’s played his best basketball under Golden State. 

The things we aren’t sure of: The Kyrie factor. They obviously have a friendship, but how close that is or if they’re going to play off each other in free agency isn’t really well known. 

The legacy factor. Durant has said he doesn’t care who gets the credit many times, but he’s also been known to beef with social media users when they call him out. Does leaving the Warriors and winning do something for Durant and does he care that much about his perception?

What might be in play: Brooklyn has been cited as a possible destination. They’re more readily able to compete compared to the Knicks. It’s also the borough with the younger, hip vibe that Durant might prefer. Boston might also be in play should Kyrie stay. I would imagine that GSW wouldn’t scoff at a sign-and-trade for some of the Celtics depth. The Clippers are also possible. They competed well and showed Durant first-hand that they’re on the come up. A much improved culture and stability in the city of Los Angeles. 


The long shots: Lakers have to be here. Don’t think Durant would leave the Warriors just to join with his rival and an unstable organization. The Thunder are also here because of their cap situation. It would be a good story, but they have no way to possibly afford KD. The Mavs and Suns might look to see if they can get a meeting out of him, but those teams don’t fit his timeline.

Kd is 6th inws/48 behind Kawhi, Giannis, Jokic and barely ahead of curry. EVEN HIS *OFFENSIVE* BPM isn't close to the best trailing kawhi, curry and jokic. No metric of any kind puts giannis on the same level as kawhi or jokic these playoffs. So why arepeople saying he's thebest in the league? Because he scored 50 points?

Hell when using plus minus metrics, even *CURRY*, whose been injured comes out well ahead.

If he's the best player in the league, how come he can't run his own team's offense? When durant ran the offense vs the clippers he managedmore turnovers than shot attempts/ Curry with the same role has been one of the most effecient volume scorers these playoffs having nowhere near as many turnovers.

Giannis is his team's best playmaker, scorer, and defender. So why the fuck is everyone saying kd's been better when he's only been his team's best scorer?

In this set for Team A to end up with 12 points, they have to hit six out of ten 2 pt attempts. And for Team B to score twelve points they’ll only need to hit four of their ten 3 pt attempts. Essentially, both teams end up even with 12 points but one needed to make 40% of their shot attempts while the other needed to make 60%. Let’s just call this the 40/60 split.

Arguably, based on this 40/60 split it can be said that it’s a better strategy to shoot more 3’s as fewer successful attempts are needed to score the same amount of points as shooting 2 pt shots. And it’s easier to improve 40% 3 pt shooting than it is to sustain 60% 2 pt shooting. That seems reasonable, anyway. So if more concentration is spent shooting 3’s and improving the odds of successful 3’s better results will follow compared to teams that concentrate more on shooting 2’s.

Back to the 40/60 split . There’s something about the argument that both teams end up “even” with 12 points after 10 shots that doesn’t seem quite right for some reason. The 3 pt shooting team missed six of their ten shots while the 2 pt shooting team missed only four. So what happens next with those missed shots? Let’s assume in a very simplified argument that Team A and Team B are playing against each other. Team A shoots only two’s and hits 60% of their attempts. Team B shoots only 3’s and hits 40% of their attempts. In the ‘10 shot’ scenario above, Team A missed four of its ten attempts and Team B missed six of its attempts. Let’s assume an opponent rebound for each miss. And each rebound is followed by the rebounding team coming down the floor and attempting a FG. Essentially, Team A has to defend against its four misses while Team B has to defend against its six misses.

Team A will now attempt six 2 pt shots while Team B will now attempt four 3 pt shots. Team A hits 60% of its six attempts and ends up with 3.6 field goals. At two points each, Team A ends with 7.2 points. Team B hits 40% of its four attempts and ends up with 1.6 field goals. At three points each, Team B ends with 4.8 points. The total for each team at this point is Team A with 19.2 points (12 + 7.2) and Team B with 16.8 (12 + 4.8).

Then go one step further. In this previous set Team A made 3.6 out of six attempts, missing 2.4 shots. Team B made 1.6 out of four attempts, missing 2.4. When Team A converts 60% of its 2.4 attempts (from Team B's misses) it will end up with 2.88 points (1.44 FG x 2). When Team B converts 40% of Team A’s 2.4 misses, it will end up with 2.88 points (.96 FG x 3). So now Team A has a total of 22.08 and Team B has a total of 19.68. And we've got 2.4 attempts and a net of 2.88 points for each team now.

I’ve essentially stopped the scenario at this point and am not sure when (if ever) Team B will be able to recover to the point of breaking even and eventually getting a lead. Team A, the 2 pt shooting team, apparently has an advantage once the second round of shots begins. Implications of that advantage are up for debate. And this is an exceptionally limited scenario. And there may be something very basic I’m missing from this scenario that should be added to make it more complete.

Jokic and Embiid have looked dominant. Gobert mostly just did Gobert things. Kanter seems to have replaced like 85% of what Nurkic gave the Blazers. Gasol is putting up like 7 pts a game but playing great defense. Vucevic got pretty much shut down and Adams didn't look very good. Drummond also looked pretty bad. 

On the less traditional side, Horford has been killing it. Harrell was great. Capella has looked worse than last year, especially against the Warriors. Myles Turner was not good. Obviously, the Warriors have looked good sans center but that always been their thing. 
  
I wonder if one of the takeaways will be to not overpay the center middle-class. Why pay Nurk 20 mil when Kanter can fill that role effectively for the minimum? Adams Vuc Turner and Capella all looked pretty replaceable too. Obviously, the top tier guys have looked worth the money.

I think teams are already pretty much there on this one, but the need for a guy that can slow down an Embiid or Jokic is looking like a must-have for every contender. I don't mean every team needs Marc Gasol because obviously, that won't happen. But, I think teams pretty much need at least one big bodied center for those matchups in particular, even if it is just a Bogut or Moose type.

Don’t get me wrong CP3 is a star but he’s injury prone and in my opinion he isn’t an all nba PG. They could have either let CP3 go and save the cap for good, young role players to compliment James harden. Or waited until the 2019 offseason to try to pick up a big free agent such as KD or Anthony Davis that’s young and in their prime. I also don’t believe that it was smart to give Clint capela that 90 MILLION DOLLAR contract as well. Capela is an excellent defender but he’s an offensive liability. When JH needs help Clint Capela can’t do much but catch lobs, his face up game is non existent and his drive moves are nonexistent. I just don’t see him being worth 90 MILLION. Because of those 2 contracts the rockets can’t build a proper team to combat the warriors. They could have paid Ariza and paid CP3 And Capela significantly less, while signing excellent role players to compliment their offense.

Philly is doing a good job neutralizing Siakam with this, but it's giving up an obvious and easy mismatch in the post. Run our offense almost exclusively through Marc Gasol on the high post. Just put Siakam all the way in a corner to take Embiid out of the paint. Have the focal point of our offense be the mismatch Marc Gasol has in the post on Tobias Harris. Seriously, just let him post up every play, a player like Gasol should destroy Harris easily in the post 1-on-1. If Philly sends another defender to double team Gasol, he can easily use his elite passing skills to find an open 3 for Lowry, Green, or Kawhi. Now, we have missed a lot of open shots so far; if one of our guys goes cold, we can just run an action on the perimeter to get one of our hot shooters open. (Ex: if Lowry goes cold and his defender collapses on Gasol, have Lowry immediately set an off-ball screen on Kawhi's defender to get Kawhi open in the perimeter in a 2-on-1 situation.) If we are playing inconsistent shooters like Norm/McCaw/etc. and their defender helps on Gasol, just have them set an off-ball screen for a shooter or cut to the basket baseline and let Gasol find them for a wide open layup. If Philly sticks to this defense and we execute, this will result in 1. a Gasol post move on Harris/ 2. an open 3/ 3. a wide open layup EVERY SINGLE PLAY.

Expected counter-adjustment #1: Philly goes back to their base defense (Tobi on Siakam, Embiid on Gasol)
This is fairly simple, just go back to our game 1 game plan with running most to all of our offense through Siakam and Kawhi. Tobias can't stop Siakam attacking the paint. Kawhi is Kawhi, even with Ben Simmons playing excellent defense on him. If either of those guys get help D, keep having Lowry and Green shoot, they have to start making their open jumpers eventually.

Expected counter-adjustment #2: Tobias Harris guards either Lowry or Green, Embiid guards Gasol, Jimmy guards Pascal
Solution #1: Run Kyle Lowry PnPs with Serge or Gasol; The Kyle-Serge mid range PnP was money early on in the season and they still have the chemistry to pull it off I'm sure. Meanwhile we all know that Marc Gasol is a great 3pt shooter and can pop out to shoot 3s regularly. This will help Lowry get going as he should get plenty of easy drives with either Tobi coming off a screen or driving on a retreating Embiid. Lowry should beat both those guys off the dribble with no problem.

Solution #2: GO BIG. Run Lowry/Siakam/Kawhi/Ibaka/Gasol with Danny Green coming off the bench and giving shooting and defense to a Bench Mob missing both. The key to this lineup is constantly targeting Redick defensively. With Danny Green not in the starting lineup, there is nobody for JJ to hide on defensively. JJ Redick literally cannot guard any of these guys and we should be ABUSING him defensively. It's honestly a shame that Nurse hasn't done so yet.

Now, if we manage to run JJ onto the bench, I'm sure Philly is going to be prepared with another adjustment of their own. I'll address this in my next post.

1) The Embiid/Butler PnR was so effective and Simmons wasn't playing mainly offball in the half court so I expect Kawhi to guard Jimmy. The raptors probably put Siakam on Simmons, Gasol/Ibaka on Embiid, and either one of Lowry/Green on Redick/Harris. 


If they do this what matchups/scheme's resulting from the switch for you think the Sixers make? Back to the JJ/Embiid two man game?



2)  This is less likely but Gasol should be getting more touches in the high post.

That's where he's most effective at creating allowing for less of a burden on Kawhi.


Harris has been guarding him and they've tried to work Gasol in the low post with him but it's been ineffective and Harris has done a good job to the tune of only 4 points in 51 possessions. Do you think Harris would be as effective at guarding Gasol in the high post and if not what do the sixers do to adjust?

A player can score a ton of points on great efficiency if an entire offense is built around him and he has the perfect complementary teammates. Some players can average 10 rebounds a game, but 8 could be uncontested. A player who dominates the ball can easily put up 7 or 8 assists. And we all know how misleading blocks and steals can be. Simply stated raw stats are not an accurate measure of greatness because how they can be manipulated by system, role, and opportunity.

Instead we should measure a players greatness by skill. 

For example instead of simply looking at PPG and TS% look at scoring skills:

1. 3 point shooting

2. Ability to create own shot on isolation

3. Off ball ability

4. Free throw shooting

5. Mid-range shooting

6. Fast break 

7. Finish at the rim

8. Post offense.

9. Driving ability

As you can see it will take much more effort to measure a players scoring ability looking at specific skills instead of two numbers on a spreadsheet. But that really is the right way to measure a player. This is only one example (scoring) but we could do the same thing for play making, rebounding, perimeter defense, ect. 

Skills instead of Stats. Of course stats are helpful to corroborate what we see.

&amp;#x200B;

1.The main concern about 76ers entering in this game was the Turnovers.Even though they have more turnovers then the Raptors in all 3 games,they arent as many as people would have expected.And since we talking about turnovers,how many people said that Kawhi will lock Simmons and he would average 6 turnovers per game,but yet he has 7 turnovers in 3 games?and a lot of this had to do with the coach.Simmons isnt the primary ball-handler in this series and that is a smart thing because as fast as Kawhi gets to him he always passes the ball and doesnt make dribble that will result in losing the ball.

&amp;#x200B;

2.Other concern were that they bench sucked and they are not at the same level as the Raptors bench.But they have found 3 good players in the bench who produce a lot more then the Raptors bench.More exactly Ennis average more points then the whole Raptors bench in the whole 3 games in almost 3x less time.Ennis has 34 points in 69 minutes while Raptors whole bench has 30 in 188 minutes.Even though 2 of them i expected to play good(Ennis and Scott),Monroe was a big surprise,cause i dont know what 76ers would have done with Boban.

&amp;#x200B;

3.The Coach.Brett Brown was incredible in this series so far.A lot of people talked shit about him,but the rotation,the matchups and the bench were genious.

&amp;#x200B;

4.The [Offense](https://Offense.Like).A lot of people expected Raptors defense to win the game and like i said above Kawhi to lock Ben and Gasol to lock Embiid.Even though Kawhi locked Ben and succeded most of the times in this 3 games and Gasol too in the first 2 games the other players from 76ers showed up.

&amp;#x200B;

5.The Defense.Even i didnt expect the defense of 76ers to be this good.Simmons-Butler-Embiid are making 76ers a defense team to be scared of.Simmons does a good job in defending Kawhi even though he still makes most of the shots,he makes him take more thougher shots and he makes him more tired.Embiid on Siakam and Gasol,specially today and in game 2 when he locked Siakam.And Butler on Lowry,making Raptors fans to doubt him again.

&amp;#x200B;

6.The Offensive Rebounds.I have to give credit to this since we have double the Offensive Rebounds then the Raptors in all this 3 games.And if 76ers main concern are turnovers,one of the Raptors is the Offensive Rebounds

They have a new coach, and brought in Marc Gasol, Kawhi, Danny, and more. The guys I just mentioned are experienced so that probably helps the transition, but how big of a deal do you think it is?

Kawhi: **43.8 PTS**/**10.2 REB**/4.6 AST/**1.8 STL**/0.6 BLK/**3.4 TOV**/**3.2 PF**/**128 ORtg**/**97 DRtg**/**57.7% FG**

KD: 42.8 PTS/6.6 REB/**6.1 AST**/1.7 STL/**1.6 BLK**/5.3 TOV/4.5 PF/123 ORtg/111 DRtg/52.7% FG

**Kawhi dominates the counting stats argument**, being better in every category except for assists and blocks.

Now let's take a look at their advanced stats (just found out how to export bball-ref tables lmao)

|Rk|Player|Season|Age|G|MP|PER|TS%|3PAr|FTr|ORB%|DRB%|TRB%|AST%|STL%|BLK%|TOV%|USG%||OWS|DWS|WS|WS/48||OBPM|DBPM|BPM|VORP|
|-:|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|
|1|Kevin Durant|2018-19|30|8|305|27.7|.672|.323|.503|0.4|15.0|7.9|20.7|1.7|3.1|14.3|33.0||1.3|0.2|1.5|.241||5.3|0.2|5.5|0.6|
|2|Kawhi Leonard|2018-19|27|7|250|32.8|.696|.314|.336|5.5|16.2|11.1|18.2|1.8|1.2|9.8|32.2||1.3|0.6|1.9|.362||12.7|-0.2|12.5|0.9|

Kawhi has a higher TS% than KD, as well as leading by a good margin in PER, DWS, WS, WS/48, OBPM, BPM, and VORP.

Now, obviously stats don't mean much without context, as there are many factors that affect a player's statistical performance. This benefits the argument that Kawhi is a better player than Kevin Durant as well. **Kawhi is scoring more points on a higher TS% than the guy who some people are crowning the most unstoppable shot creator ever.** So far, Kawhi Leonard has faced an Orlando Magic defense that was top 5 post-ASB and had long, rangy, talented wing defenders such as Aaron Gordon and Jonathan Isaac. Now, he is facing a Sixers team with even better wing defenders like Ben Simmons and Jimmy Butler. Meanwhile, Kevin Durant was guarded by guys like Patrick Beverly and Danilo Gallinari Round 1. PJ Tucker and Chris Paul play KD very well, but he has a far easier matchup against a Rockets team with a gaping hole at SF. 

In addition, Kevin Durant is clearly surrounded by better teammates. As good as the Raptors have been this year, I admit that the team with ~~5~~ 4 all-stars has a better team surrounding KD than what Kawhi has. In the game he scored 50 on the Clippers, Curry was getting double-teamed at half court while he was left in single coverage against a Clippers team with zero All-Stars. (This is a common theme these last 2-3 years; defenses focus almost exclusively on Curry and never seem to make any real adjustments for KD, but that's a story for a different post :) )On the other hand, Kawhi is being double- and triple- teamed by elite defenses, and manages to convert extremely difficult looks nontheless.

And I haven't even mentioned defense once. A locked in Kawhi Leonard is still the best defender on the planet. He expends way more energy on the defensive end, as the duo of Kawhi and Siakam often pick up the best offensive players on the floor and lock them down. Meanwhile, Kevin Durant is nowhere near that level. He gets blocks but that's honestly about it. He's honestly not a bad defender, but he's above average at best. This pales in comparison to Kawhi and won't be enough to earn him the title of best player in the world. KD is surrounded by elite defenders like Klay, Draymond, Iggy, and Looney and is able to expend all of his energy on the offensive end, yet is still not on the level of Kawhi Leonard.

In conclusion: Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard are both insanely good basketball players and clear top 5 players. However, Kawhi has been the clearly superior player this year, taking into account stats and their respective situations. **Kawhi has better counting stats, better advanced stats, and plays far better defense despite being in a tougher situation than KD.**

I hate hearing that about Lebron and Peyton Manning or the slew of other sports figures that the media likes to build up and tear down like a Shakespearean tragedy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Critics might argue  - well they aren't clutch. Only, no one has ever defined clutch in any way that seems meaningful. Is it just playoff games? Is it conference finals? Is it the finals? Is it only in the last 2 minutes of a tied finals game? You get this inevitable moving off the goal posts to fit a narrative. And when you actually dig into the numbers, clutch never actually shows up in the data. 

&amp;#x200B;

Harden is plenty scary to face that I bet even his loudest critics are unwilling to put hard money against him. I knew enough Patriot fans who swore up and down that Manning was a choking loser, but on game day, they feared him. They'd rather face a clutch Joe Flacco than a loser like Manning. any time. That to me is evidence that they don't even believe it themselves. If that player really is a choker, you should have nothing to fear.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally - its always hilarious to me how we remember chokers. Russel Wilson throws the costliest interception in nfl history, but he's not a choker. Manning is. Tom Brady potentially throws a game ending int against the chiefs this year, but its dropped. He's not a choker. He puts up a measly 14 pts with one of the greatest offenses of all time and he's not a choker.  Kobe Bryant is clutch despite Henry Abbot writing a long article debunking it. But Lebron is a choker right? He choked away that Mavs series. But then, how did he break that 73 win warriors team? Was he a choker and then learned not to be? Or did he needed Ray Allen to teach him first?

&amp;#x200B;

If you think I'm being myopic for picking out a few examples - that's the point. I'm not labeling any of these players chokers or clutch players. They are just great players. If you want to label Kobe an all time player, fine he is. Tom Brady is one of the greatest qbs of all time. Just don't tell me its because they are clutch. No, they are great and great players usually do great things and occasionally don't.

Moe Harkless - Ankle Sprain - Did not return. Postgame social media message was he is OK.
Jamal Murray - Right thigh bruise - returned to game but looked hobbled. 
Torrey Craig - Broken nose - returned to game


What do people think of these injuries and how they may affect the series? How they may affect strategy for each team?

My thoughts:
If Jamal is hobbled, I think the Blazers need to exploit him on defense as much as possible. He won't be physical enough to guard Hood/Harkless (if playing). Not fast enough to hang with CJ or Dame. Blazers need to make him a liability on that side of the court. 

Harkless had been guarding Murray in game two and him being out could mean Dame has to defend Denver's starting guards. With him out, Portland needs Hood to step up BIG. Game two they were giving him Dame rest on defense by matching up with Craig. If Dame is on the two guards, I see them putting Dame in lots of pick n rolls with whichever starting guard he takes. 

Craig looks like he is battling through, and has done so in the past (already had the mask). If he is slowed by the injury at all he won't be able to guard Dame or CJ... They need him to be there for that especially if Murray is slowed by his thigh. 


Last thought: While Harkless was the only one to not return last night, given Portland's deeper bench I think Denver needs to be more worried about Murray and their defensive stopper Craig.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,32191,public,self,Portland vs Denver - Injury Ramifications,0,1557422070,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/bjxd4d/portland_vs_denver_injury_ramifications/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But with the fewer made threes comes an aesthetically unpleasing affect:  more missed shots.  That's not where it ends, though.  These are not missed shots at the rim - such a blown layup of blocked shot.  Blown layups and blocked shots take milliseconds to complete.  That all adds to the excitement of the game.  A missed three takes forever.  And they seem to get further out every game.  There's the part about the specialist catching a pass, setting up then unloading a three.  It's in the air, slowly making it's way to the area of the rim.  The crowd watching all this unfold.  And the shot normally ends in disappointment.  Another miss.  ""That's ok, we'll just get more specialists to shoot them threes more often.""   That means you'll be missing more often.  ""But look at the stats.""  But look at the game.     

Soon we may need to start measuring hang time.  The NFL had a similar problem with too many  field goals ruining the game.  Fans would watch in horror as some specialist trotted onto the field to loft some high arching kick time after time.  The ball would slowly make its way toward the goal.  The fans watching all this unfold.  The NBA is that problem times a million for too many threes.  Fans have an investment in every shot attempted by their beloved team.  It doesn't help when there are more misses.  It especially doesn't help when there are more misses at a higher rate.

Maybe we should rethink a few things.  There's the old saying about you only have to hit 4 out of 10 three point attempts to end up with the same number of points as hitting 6 out of 10 two point attempts.  Maybe improving toward that ""6 out of 10""  number would be a good idea.  You know, concentrating on more makes and fewer misses as opposed to more missed shots but at a higher pace.  I'm not advocating for opening up the lane. But we should make mid-range play more attractive.  There seems to be constant talk about moving the 3-pt line, rules interpretations regarding threes, defenders guarding against the 3 by standing BEHIND offensive players in some nightmarish parallel universe thing.

I don’t care at all when judging who’s a better player in how they stack up individually in their skillsets or even to a significant extent their stats or  their perceived level of offensive and defensive ability.


I feel like in today’s era of social media the thing that these are what are regarded above all else when comparing players. To me this is only part of the game, there is so much more to the game than what appears on the statsheet, in their skillset or theoretical advantages over the other player (height, weight, strength) - from how a player provides spacing to their team to how a player betters the running of an individual playtype to even how their fucking energy surrounding their character changes their teammates’ mindset and attitudes to the game (this one is bullshit just to convey the idea that there are so many ways a player even slightly impacts the game to the extent the current way of judging players is flawed)


Obviously context is so important to this, different teammates cause different dynamics and level of success in all facets of the game so you can only ever really use this to judge the long established stars and superstars of the league.

Goldsberry does a lot of work with shooting charts, so he sees first-hand exactly how the shot distribution has changed in the NBA. The article is here: http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26633540/the-nba-obsessed-3s-let-fix-thing

Here are his proposals, from least crazy to most crazy (in my opinion).

*  Getting rid of the corner 3

This is something I've seen discussed before. Why is the corner 3 line shorter than the rest of the 3-point line? We would simply change the line so that it is a uniform distance throughout the entire court. It would be much more difficult to shoot corner 3s as this point because there will be parts of the court where you simply can't shoot a 3 while remaining in-bounds, but there is still some room to manuever in the corner.

*  Data-driven line

A data-driven line means moving the line to wherever the league's expected points per shot is 1, or 33.33% from that distance. As of right now, that would mean moving the line back to about 25 feet, 9 inches, which is more than 2 feet beyond where it currently is. We could re-visit this every year and change the distance of the 3-point line to be wherever our shooters are making about 33.33% of their shots. 

* Custom lines

He likened this to how MLB stadiums are unique, that no two stadiums have the same playing dimensions. Teams would be able to come up with their own 3-point line for the season. The Warriors would move the line further back, so that their snipers could keep making 3s while other teams couldn't keep up, while teams like the Jazz might get rid of their 3-point shot altogether. 

*  Goaltending is allowed for 3 point shots

Pretty straightforward, you can goaltend on 3-point attempts. Goldsberry admitted that he didn't know the best way to legislate this to make sure it's not overpowered for big men, and he recommended testing it in the G-League first to find a balanced method.

Personally, I think the data-driven line is the most feasible and probably makes the most sense of these options, but I would love to see custom lines.

The refs looked genuinely overwhelmed and stressed out and I​ for one actually​ don't blame the​m (I do however blame Tony Brothers) The interpretation of the rules seem to keep changing and the pace of the modern game rarely allows them to get clean looks. 

As a basketball fan and player for over 30 years,  I no longer have a clear idea of what constitutes a foul as it is so wildly inconsistent.​​ Is the hand apart of the ball, what is the rule for kicking out feet on a jump shot vs. safe landing, what constitutes verticality and a foul, over the back, overzealous dribble handoff screens vs fighting through screens? As frustrated as I am as a fan, I can't imagine how the players feel.​

Draymond Green's comments post Game 1 against the Rockets about refereeing being an inexact science is 100% accurate but puts 100% of the onus on the refs which is a third of the issue as players are also interpreting and manipulating the rules to gain an advantage and the league is not supporting and enforcing definitive criteria and understanding of the rule calling to either sides. 

In short the NBA has a ​HUGE​ problem. ​Missed calls are understandable, blown calls due to individual interpretation and refuting calls based on bias and misunderstanding of rules are not. ​

I did not feel the same frustration watching NCAA tournament games.  My explanation is the unspoken respect allowed to college refs that has disappeared in the NBA. This manifests in the back and forth between players and referees, pressure for special star treatment and constant calls for rule changes game to game. 

The continuous in game dialogs and post game rants in the NBA ​​cannot​ be allowed to​ continue. Both sides need to take responsibility and collaborate. The league needs to intervene and institute pre game, in game and post game improvement mechanism​s​ devoid of any individual pressure or influence. 

​

My suggested solution:   


\- Take all rules in the play book and run an annual NBA Rules training camp in the offseason. Require all NBA referees/refs in training AND two members of each NBA team to participate. The training camp will clearly identify and demonstrate what the practical criteria for what constitutes a foul in different situations and give a clear set of expectations for each side as a foundation to understanding how games will be called.  The goal is a mutually created and simplified rule calling criteria and allow all stakeholders including fans to understand how games will be called

\- The goal is to diffuse the us vs. them mentality pervading the league. No more Star rules, regular season vs playoff rules, no more 4th quarter rules, no more make up calls.  Just THE rules. This is the ""fair chance"" Harden was pleading for whether rightly or wrongly and what all involved need to strive for.

\- The two team ""Rules Ambassadors"" will be responsible for disseminating the rules and training their respective teams.

\- During the pre-season schedule this effort will be supported as each team will have a lead NBA referee be required to work directly with a randomly selected NBA team and to review the preseason games and reinforce the rule calling criteria via actual game play examples. 

\- The goal is to allow engagement and dialog between the refs and the players outside of a critical win-lose environment. 

\- Each teams' Rules Ambassadors will be their team's only point of contact to refute calls post game. No more belittling the refs about it. NO more reporters baiting players and coaches.  This isn't to say players cannot voice respectful displeasure or refute a call in the moment but, no chatting and pulling refs aside for pow wows and no screaming, bumping or harassment. No more subjectiveness by the refs on behaviour levels before a technical is called or senseless ejection issued. Keep chirping and you are gone.

\- As an evolution of the L2M reporting, the NBA will continuously monitor and allow for teams' Rules Ambassadors to submit reviews of their games and get clear empirical feedback to support the establishment of mutually beneficial ""standard"" calls. The goal is to have the Team Ambassadors is not only to champion a team but, also act as a support in refuting their own players claims of injustice based on the detailed criteria and provide further rules training as required. The flipside will be league tracking of invalid players ""flopping"" and invalid arguing of calls with regular offenders subject to penalty and/or suspension and mandatory additional rules training.  All findings will be shared and accessible by all stakeholders. 

\- Likewise the league monitoring will identify needed support and training to the referee crews as to improve consistency of game calling and persistent repeat offenders will be subject to suspension.  
\- Any NBA mandated ruling changes in or post season will require involvement and approval by a clear majority of the NBA board of team owners or the collective of the teams' Rules Ambassadors. Sufficient time for the requisite additional training of refs and players will be mandatory.

\- The ingame change I would make is to allow for one challenge per a half from the coaches. If the challenge is validated then they get to use it again that half. Any challenge that is not valid results in the loss of the challenge. The challenge system, will be supported by real time active VAR (Virtual Assistant Referee) staff out of NYC HQ to limit the amount of time reviewing a challenge takes. 

&amp;#x200B;

As lover of the game, the only way to win is to improve the game together with the refs, league and teams.

2.  Kerr

5.  Malone?
6.  Brown?
7.  Bud?

It's hard to rank a lot of the newer coaches outside of Stevens.  Nurse has already made some questionable moves.  Brown has been given a weird and difficult situation to work with, but has done pretty well considering the roster turnover, I'd say.  Bud devised an elite system, but I'm not sure he's going to be very creative with it.  He seems to want to stick to his guns too much.  I know Giannis is amazing, but I don't think he can carry this team past the Celtics.  Malone has stood by Barton which is a questionable decision... unless he believes getting Barton going is somehow the magic ingredient to winning the WCF.  I think Stotts is a borderline top 5 coach and that D'Antoni is more of an innovator than an elite coach.

Before I try to make my point, a couple of disclaimers: firstly, **I realise I might be overreaching a bit here.** I'm making connections and presenting an idea more than anything else. Secondly: I don't hate analytics. I think they're pretty smart! I do, however, have issues with the *culture* that often surrounds analytics-obsessed people. And I kinda hate that sometimes I feel I'm watching the exact same play over and over again and [one game blends into another one](&lt;http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26633540/the-nba-obsessed-3s-let-fix-thing&gt;), but you might feel differently, and I respect that. Thirdly, I'm not a Rockets fan or hater, nor a fan of any other NBA team. I love basketball and I've been following the NBA closely for ~15 years, but maybe because I'm from Europe I never felt the type of irrational love and attachment for an NBA team that fandom usually calls for. I like the Spurs, think Jokic is cool, I find Drake obnoxious and can't wait to see what Clippers and Nets do the coming offseason but yeah, hopefully you get the picture.

This is also not a ""response"" to the Rockets sending that absurd memo to the NBA. I see that mostly as a power play, more a way to put pressure on their opponents - both Warriors and the refs, which is kinda sad - a la Ali/McGregor than anything else. But I find the rationale behind the complaint worrisome.

So... analytics are great! Most of the time. They make sense! If you know where to look. You tell me that shooting 40% from three yields the same results that shooting 60% from two? Sign me in! It's so difficult to shoot 60% inside the arc: the defense is super tough, there's less space to move around, and you have to execute complex plays. And who wants to do that when you can run and gun? I mean it's still hard, but defense isn't nearly as stringent on the perimeter, and with pace you can make up for that lower percentage and score even more!

But, and this is the somewhat-nutty-conspiracy theory part of this post, I think that analytics driven basketballs is also **a way for executives to secure their jobs and position by (over)simplifying the sport.** Think about it this way: you want to be hired as GM for the Positano Flyers, and a 70 year old billionaire has to hire you. On one hand you could start telling them about your experience, that maybe that guy you already have on the team can develop well, and maybe with the right coach and the right situation around them you can put together a good team. But those are a lot a of maybes, what ifs. What if player and coach don't jell on a personal level? What if the style of play isn't the right one for the team? What about chemistry?

But on the other hand, what if you could throw *almost everything* out of the window because you have a **system that, on paper, always works:** X and O's don't really matter, players are either ""good"" or ""bad"" for the system, and the only role a coach has, on offense at least, is not to get in the way. You run, you shoot a lot, you run some more and, in theory, it should *always* work. Guaranteed. Suddenly you're not selling your expertise, but a business plan. There's not risk involved and looking at the numbers, everything makes sense! Said billionaire doesn't like risks and things they don't understand like basketball, and the numbers check out, so you land the job.

----

There's a difference, I think, between using analytics to improve decision making and game plan by blending them with traditional basketball knowledge and being *obsessed* with spreadsheets. I believe Zach Lowe when he says that (I'm paraphrasing) ""Only idiots *solely* look at the numbers to make decisions, and people in front offices usually aren't stupid"" and I believe most successful teams use them the ""right way"". You could say that the main reason for the Warriors continued success lies in their historic level of talent, and you might be right, but they also employ a style of play that perfectly suits their superstars, and analysis helps them to make better decisions. 

And then there's the Spurs. Oh, the Spurs. The backwards-playing Spurs. The Texan Cavemen, shooting 2s like it's 2005. Still, they had the ranked seventh offense in the league, better than a bunch of happy(er) shooting teams. And that makes sense right? With the team they have that's how they decided to play, and they were very successful at it. Popovich/Messina might be the most decorated coaching head/assistant duo ever put together, so they know what they're doing. I'm sure they use analytics a lot, and their guys who can shoot from deep really do let it fly. Look at Patty Mills and Belinelli. But their defense was kind trash and they don't have the 40-points guy that contenders really need to win ugly games, so they fell short in the first round. But that wasn't the narrative we were fed.

Floating on the internet you can find and endless supply of articles [like this](&lt;https://www.theringer.com/2019/4/25/18514670/san-antonio-spurs-pop-nuggets-game-6&gt;). I don't want to single out the writer, but look at their choice of words. They talk about *faith in analytics*, the *dogmas* of a copycat league obsessed with TS%. Those are not the words of a scientist. But journalists are also benefitting enormously from the analytics revolution: if most of what you do is spit out numbers and building a narrative around them, you can take one of the greatest front office and coaching staff in basketball history, call them dumb and not really feel like an idiot.

----

These last paragraphs might look like a weird tangent but they really aren't. I think that's the reason people talk about the League relationship with analytics as an obsession: **there's very little rational about it**. If being the 7th offense in the league is not enough to convince some people that yeah, you can actually build a top offense with things others than (a lot of) threes, layups and fouls, nothing can. 

But what if you can find a way to game the system and rank up more efficiency? That's where the whole hunting for fouls and ""landing zone"" controversy lies, I think. If you can call your own fouls and control your opponent, the system is really complete. If you can defend on the other side, the offense just works. So there's nothing unpredictable about the game anymore: if your players are the right one, you shoot reliably and only the shots you want to take, you hunt for fouls exactly when you want them and you *always* get them. On paper, it's an impeccable business plan.

But basketball is still a game where 5 people have to move in three dimensions trying to put a ball inside a hoop, so it's unpredictable by nature. Referees are human, they make mistakes in good faith. Sometimes they're good and sometimes they aren't, but they're not a ""necessary evil"". They're just part of the game like the players and their coaches.

This is why I think the Rockets' attitude represent a weird cry for help. Is almost as if they don't get basketball as a real sport: in their lab, everything works as intended *all of the time*. In games, they're doing *all the right things* but their opponents, life, luck, happenstance, however you wanna call it, keeps getting in their way. So they get mad not that 27 consecutive three point shots didn't fall because well, they just didn't, but that **things got in their way even though it shouldn't have happened.** So they feel powerless. They get mad. They want the game to be called ""fairly"" even though they constantly stretch the rules and have the [president of the NBPA openly ridiculing the referees](&lt;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2753576-chris-paul-on-referee-scott-foster-thats-who-they-pay-to-see&gt;), in what really seems just a power play.

So maybe rules really have to change. A lot of the dribbling actions of the last 20 years would have been considered travel violations before the 80s, so maybe now it's time for referees to allow shooters to kick and scream their way into free throws every time they want, even if they generate the contact lading five feet from where they jumped. In other sports stuff like this happens all the time: in soccer part of the job of a good striker is to go 1-on-1 with a defender, initiate contact and drop to the ground screaming in pain hoping to draw a penalty or a free kick. Everybody who watches soccer hates it, but that's how it works. It's efficient.

On paper, what the Rockets do makes a lot of sense and it should always work as intended. They play the game to its limits pushing them even further, and most of the time get rewarded for doing so. They have one insanely gifted superstars and everything they do is done with the goal of maximizing his skills. Their coach is dedicated to the cause and everybody always knows their place in the system.

But they know only that one song. Their plan A is mesmerizing, but there's no plan B. Their plan C is plan A, their plan D is still plan A, again. You don't need an exit strategy in a lab or in a videogame, you can just restart the simulation. So when it doesn't work, well it's not their fault. **Their System is perfect, their belief unshakeable. So, when it fails, it's the game that has to change.**

----

**tl;dr:** the aberration of analytics culture is trying to control everything in the game, including your opponent, in order to secure outcome and guarantee success. At their best, analytics are no different from set plays. You do something because you have a reason (experience or numbers) to believe that it will lead the team to victory. And if it doesn't work you try to learn from it, improve on the formula, and try again, do it better. But if your approach to analytics resembles more religious zeal than empirical reasoning, your next bet is to try to change that one aspect of the sport that doesn't fit your beliefs, so that you System doesn't have to change.",False,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,31657,public,self,Is ref bashing and rules bending the natural evolution of analytics-driven basketball?,0,1556724673,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/bj4nx9/is_ref_bashing_and_rules_bending_the_natural/,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'f9wxgQr1tZwpyD47pY8otOPxW96chwM7iuZuzEZhxfM', 'resolutions': [{'height': 81, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/pxSp1OD5dzfr3ss6dJGuUXs9JDKvYsJqcuHkal-HGD8.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9289f58915a4c088afcc49ee6a3601871f846bc6', 'width': 108}, {'height': 162, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/pxSp1OD5dzfr3ss6dJGuUXs9JDKvYsJqcuHkal-HGD8.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c135ad1c77caf503f3e6de494aac2f08fc51e7bc', 'width': 216}, {'height': 240, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/pxSp1OD5dzfr3ss6dJGuUXs9JDKvYsJqcuHkal-HGD8.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc6ab939bf28f45becc8eb583e44810904e9579c', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/pxSp1OD5dzfr3ss6dJGuUXs9JDKvYsJqcuHkal-HGD8.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=7aa81c0abeb8df7c9a4f367396ecec42540389ad', 'width': 480}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,

Its a flawed endeavor from the start. It might work in the regular season but in the playoffs the game changes.

Rockets basically analyze the game like a business with points being money. ""How can we gain points that we're not getting?"" But points in a game are not a market share. There's not some large number of points and individual teams siphoning off their share. Missed foul calls are not missed points. But when teams like the Rockets lose, they think its because they didn't get enough possessions to make their strategy mathematically viable. So the Rockets strategy is dependent on the refs and dependent on 3pt shots, not because its hacking the rules but because they NEED that many possessions to make their game plan work. They win with volume. More 3pts and more FTs mean more points scored in less game time. Makes sense but there a sweet spot they HAVE to hit if they want to win. If they get the average or less than average number of possessions, the Rockets simply cannot win playing their analytic style. This is why they struggle in the playoffs when the number of possessions per game goes down. 

In the playoffs, the world of basketball does not regress to the mean. The teams are all above average statistically. So building a team based around statistics and averages means your team is built to beat average teams only. When opponents perform better than average, like all playoff teams do, then the Rockets gameplan has another soft spot, namely that the other team will perform better than the statistics the Rockets based their gameplan on. Because their statistics are based on regular season numbers, the playoffs are anamalous data. The playoff data itself is a fraction of the entirety of data, yet, the playoffs are the only games that really matter. This is why you want basketball minds creating your basketball team, not businessmen or guys that try to apply stock market strategies to sports. 

Because of their reliance on statistics, the Rockets are built to beat the bad teams and lose to the good teams. The Rockets are built for isolation plays. The Rockets are built to seek foul calls because that was an area of ""lost point share"". There are very few defensive stats so the Rockets don't really care much about defense. None of this is winning strategy for a playoff team. Because, once again, a good team is worth more than the sum of its parts. The Rockets are simply the sum of its parts. If their talent is enough to beat you, and they get foul calls and hit their 3s, you're beat. But if they have less talent, get less calls or hit less 3s they simply can't win.

A good team overcomes the statistically poor shooting nights. They do other things. Except PJ Tucker, I don't see anyone on the Rockets doing the other things that make you win. Why? Because it doesn't show up in the stat sheet. Hustle is invisible to their bosses, its not how they make decisions, so why hustle? You can see the mentality that could emerge from this statistical outlook. You lose the parts of the game that slip through the statistical cracks. This makes the Rockets less able to analyze what's happening out there which means their statistical outlook gives them a view of the game that is incomplete. Therefore their statistical modeling is incomplete, as all models have to exclude some data to achieve a specific goal. For the Rockets, this was hustle and effort and the things that made someone like Dennis Rodman a champion. 

The Rockets were not built to overcome adversity. They were built to steamroll bad teams and pray they beat good ones by chance. Their game plan against good teams is chucking up more 3s and drawing fouls to eek out a statistical victory. Their strategy is not strategic, which is why they have trouble beating teams with a real game plan. If your strategy is based on stats and not basketball theory then who makes the changes when things go bad? The coach or the stats? Playing to stats makes them predictable too. They can't diverge from their chucking 3s and drawing fouls game plan because they're hoping the stats will turn it all around. ""We gotta start hitting 3s eventually."" So they double down and have to chuck even more threes faster or draw even more fouls to catch up. They're hopelessly married to their analyics game plan and this makes them unable to adapt, which is what playoff basketball is all about. 

Not to mention all the other parts of the game that can't be statistically analyzed like fatigue, mental mistakes, travel, crowd noise, media noise, personal issues, injuries, etc. A team built on basketball theory takes into account all actions that effect the outcome of the game. Morey's statistical analysis only takes into account the measureable stats. The Rockets are blind to their own weaknesses. Their biggest weakness being the reliance on one player, James Harden. They see that as a strength and not a weakness. There is a reason they're the only team to put so much stock into stats.

if a team has 100 instances when a foul could have happened compared to another team who has 75 instances when a foul could happen, of course the ref would have more miss calls against the first team. This means the refs could be treating each team fairly even if one team gets more calls called wrongly.


Now a lot of people are saying that the referees are doing a bad job but they're not even providing a solution. Most of them just state the problem without thinking how can we fix it. You have 3 people on the court officiating the game. They don't have a bird's eye view of what's happening. Their decisions are based on things that happen within a split of a second and some rules in the rulebook are vague so sometimes it's hard to tell if a foul occurred or not.

Some people have given solutions such as giving each team the ability to challenge a call but others say that it will ruin the flow of the game.


now what if that problem gets fixed? here's another problem, comparing a 3-point, a 2-point, and a freethrow, the freethrow is the most efficient way of scoring. The number of mid-range shots are getting reduced because it's just more efficient to shoot a 3 or a 2 near the basket.

It looks like they assigned a point value to every potential infraction, even the ones the NBA reviewed and still found to be inconclusive, and then added them all up.

Needless to say, assuming every potential foul, even the ones that were so close they couldn't be determined after review, should and will get called in the playoffs is a massive flaw in their reasoning.

I'm honestly surprised Houston allowed this to leak because it is not a good look for them.

It lasted until January 1999 and ended with a 50 game NBA schedule as a way to salvage an otherwise ugly, protracted fight between the two sides.  I was coming off a season writing for Sportsline at the time, one of three writers that covered fantasy NBA, as well as having an NBA fantasy preview in Fantasy Sports Magazine (Krause Publications).  The reason I was able to write for these two companies was due to a color coded grid-type chart I came up with years earlier that showed how to manipulate an NBA schedule by exploiting players on teams that had 4-game weeks.  At the time there were 29 NBA teams that played over the course of 25 weeks so there were the usual extremes in 4-game weeks due to a small sample size of the schedule.  That concept took about a year or two to catch on (was initially rejected by countless magazines and websites).  And it was followed by a few seasons on Sportsline where weekly scoring averages were an industry standard, which I'm assuming was due partly to the ability of the schedules being manipulated and others considering this some sort of unfairness.  At least that's the feed back I received.

Back to the lockout.  It was July when it started and most assumed the lockout would be resolved prior to the regular season starting.  It wasn't.  But magazines had to be published anyway.  So three months later I'm walking through Walmart and spot the magazine my article was published in, there were about 100,000 magazines published.  Hardly any sold as the lockout lingered and in fact 99%  were eventually returned to the publisher and essentially turned to mulch.  The lockout continued.

What is forgotten about the 98-99 lockout is this was the season following the Michael Jordan retirement which was a new era for the league. It also saw the breakup of the Bulls.  Although the Bulls were not exactly a universally loved franchise (ask Detroit and Cleveland fans about their love for the Bulls), their legacy cannot be denied.  And with the breakup of the Bulls came the departure of Phil Jackson, replaced by former Iowa State coach Tim ""Pink"" Floyd.  He christened his NBA career with a 13-37 record for the defending champs.  That was followed by seasons of 17-65 and 15-67.  

From many players' perspective the breakup of the Bulls was more symbolic than administerial.   It was a power move by the NBA owners as a prelude to an upcoming battle expected with the need for a new players agreement.  And the blood slowly began to boil among players, along with an obvious and lasting distrust of owners.  Jordan retires, sure that's expected.  Give Phil Jackson the boot despite six world titles in eight years and the gloves are coming off. From this perspective the players were judging trust of owners in how they were dealing with a former player-turned-coach, who, despite heavy credentials, was on his way out of Chicago no matter what.  Jerry Krause said so and he seemed to have the support of Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf.  

But the 98-99 season would eventually tip off and play a fifty game schedule.  The next season was ho-hum as well.  It was the time leading up to the 2000-01 season where the impact of the Bulls breakup would become apparent.  Three big time free agents were available: Tim Duncan, Grant Hill and Tracey McGrady.  And there was rampant speculation that the Bulls would sign one of these big 3.  But, of course that didn't happen.  Duncan stayed with San Antonio while Hill and McGrady ended up in Orlando.  What did the Bulls receive?  A suddenly jobless Ron Mercer, a victim of McGrady signing with Orlando.  And Brad Miller.  

An air of resentment toward the Bulls by the NBA players was apparent and it was even speculated at the time that the Bulls franchise would not sign a legit top flight free agent until every member of the championship teams were retired from the NBA.  And that's pretty much what happened, well unless you count Ben Wallace in 2006 who lasted a season and a half before being traded away.  But still, it's Ben Wallace.  Not exactly Grant or McGrady.

Back to the 98-99 lockout for a moment.  The season was bad for writers.  Disdain for the new Jordanless NBA would continue for years.  The 1999-2000 season was approaching yet not a single magazine was willing to invest in a NBA fantasy preview. ""We might combine an NBA/NHL fantasy magazine, but the NBA itself won't sell"" or ""if we can't put Jordan on the cover, the magazine won't sell"" was often the response.  Of course, Fantasy Sports Magazine just witnessed 105,000 magazines sent to mulch from the prior season and this was at a time that fantasy NBA was still in its infancy.  Fantasy baseball and football ruled the roost at the time, and it was not even close.  Plus online leagues were now available which meant scrapping the old pencil/paper method and midnight phone calls to the commish.  Not only was football and baseball more popular, it was becoming easier to participate, meaning the gap started to grow. Meanwhile, fantasy NBA was attempting to begin a slow climb back to mainstream relevance.  And this was at a time when fantasy NHL probably rivaled fantasy NBA in participation, however difficult that is to fathom.  

As the 2000 NBA draft approached the YES Network was formed (Yankee Entertainment and Sports Network)  from it's 1999 iteration of YankeeNets.  This was an entertainment network that would feature and promote the New York Yankees and New Jersey Nets.  The 2000 draft class was horrible, probably one of the worst in NBA history.  But there was one potential future superstar, a senior from the University of Cincinnati named Kenyon Martin - a 6'9"" athletic power forward that looked the part.  Despite only a 4.4% chance of winning the number one overall pick, the Nets beat the odds and drafted the rights to Martin. The 2000-2001 season showed only a 26-56 record for the Nets but the team acquired acquired Jason Kidd prior to the beginning of the 2001-02 season and would go on to win the Atlantic Division three consecutive years, actually making it to the finals before losing to the Lakers and Spurs in 2002 and 2003, respectively.  

The Nets ""beating the odds"" for the number one overall pick was met with criticism as the event essentially mirrored the New York Knicks prelude to drafting college phenom Patrick Ewing fifteen years earlier.  It should be noted that the Knicks actually had a 14.29% chance of winning the '85 lottery compared to the Nets chances of 4.4% in 2000.  

The NBA would eventually recover, building on the successes of the Nets, Spurs and Lakers.  The Bulls would eventually rebuild their post-Jordan-era franchise through the draft and mid-level free agent signings.  Fantasy NBA would eventually climb back toward relevance.  ""The birds came back.""  That was a saying amongst insiders describing the NBA during this time period of revival.  Essentially the comparison was a former residential neighborhood met with suburban flight.  Dead neighborhoods (teams) dotted the NBA landscape at this time.  People eventually returned, just as birds would come back to previously dilapidated neighborhoods.

&amp;#x200B;

The most a team not named the hornets can offer kemba is 4 years 140 million. I believe his salary starts at 32 million a year. The best use for Kemba/Oladipo is to stagger them. Have at least one on the court at all times and then play them together at in the 4th quarter to close out games. Kemba will have his defensive deficiencies because of his height, but Oladipo can take the tougher of the 2 match ups to compensate. 

  
If the Pacers do sign him to that max, that leaves them with 17 million left to spend on free agents. 

&amp;#x200B;

Their current free agents are

Thaddeus Young

Corey Joseph

Darren Collison

Tyreke Evans

Bojan Bodgdanovic

Kyle O'Quinn

Davon Reed

&amp;#x200B;

They'll have 8 active players and will need a minimum of 6 more before the season starts

&amp;#x200B;

If they sign Kemba, the next signing has to be Bojan as hes their best shooter and just came off of a career year.

&amp;#x200B;

The next two players that have to look at re-signing are Thaddeus Young and Darren Collision. They may be able to be signed on some team friendly deals. 

&amp;#x200B;

Those 3 players may eat up all of the remaining cap.

&amp;#x200B;

Players they can look at are

Ariza - hes an aging vet coming off a big contract that could fit their defensive mold perfectly

Robin Lopez- He may be able to be signed for cheap since his numbers took a plummet being on the Bulls. His style fits perfectly with the grittiness of he pacers

Jeff Green - He's still a capable player coming off the bench. he has playoff experience and could be a good rotation piece

&amp;#x200B;

So in my opinion if all goes well and the Pacers do pursue Kemba. The best case line up for them would be

I only analyzed his games against Utah because I wanted to isolate their affect on him, and I'm going to see how it changes after the series with Golden State.

&amp;nbsp;

As we all know, Utah opted for a strange tactic of guarding the side or behind Harden at the perimeter. This forced him inside in most cases, where Gobert was waiting. I looked at three main shot types; &lt; 5 feet, 3 point attempts, and his driving floaters, since those are his bread and butter shots. The chart below describes his relative frequency on those types of shots, and then how efficient he was *during the regular season*

&amp;nbsp; 

Type of Shot | Regular Season Frequency | Post Season Frequency | Raw Change | Expected Value (Reg Season)
:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
&lt; 5 Feet | 30.4% | 26.1% | -4.3% | 1.124 Points
3 Point Attempts | 53.9% | 52.2% | -1.7% | 1.104 Points
Driving Floaters | 8.9% | 18.3% | **+9.4%** | **0.976 Points**

&amp;nbsp;

As we can see, the results that Utah likely wanted were achieved. They forced the lowest efficiency shot (floater), and took away from the other shots. 

Not only that, but (probably as a result) they made his 3 point shot much harder. During the regular season, 46.2% of Harden's three point attempts were ""tightly"" or ""very tightly"" guarded, which according to NBA's tracking stats means a player within 0-4 feet. Against Utah, **78.3%(!!)** of Harden's 3 point attempts were tightly or very tightly guarded, and very slightly hurt his efficiency from three (dropped to 35% or 1.05 expected points per attempt).

The biggest change for efficiency came from the line, however. In the regular season, Harden had a free throw rate (FTr) of 44.9%. Meaning his ratio of FTA to FGA was 0.449. Against the Jazz, it was **0.322**. How much this had to do with the Jazz defensive scheme is unknown to me. James Harden historically has a much lower FTr in the regular season than the playoffs (0.531 in the regular season in Houston vs 0.460 in the postseason in Houston.)

Personally I don’t think that they were all fouls, but there is definitely some turmoil brewing. This issue I’m seeing is James Harden has one of the most confusing unique styles in the NBA. The types of shots he takes and emphasis of trying to get to the line is almost like a nuclear Kobe Bryant at times. As we all remember Kobe started getting some heavy flak for his play style and had games where the refs would seemingly “turn against him” or “turn a blind eye” to potential fouls.

So let’s talk about it. Do you think that the shooting motion Harden is using is his natural motion or do you think he is pulling some Tom Foolerly?

Personally I don’t want to go through case by case of all the shots in question, but for the most part it seems like the shooters are landing MUCH further forward on their jump shots than normal. I’ve played basketball and I understand that some shooters will land a foot or two further forward after their shot, but a lot of the time these shots are not being taken with a good amount of forward momentum which would explain the landing spot being further forward, but look at James Hardens last shot very I think Draymond when the score was like 100-103. I think this is clearly a bait at a foul trying to get the refs to make a call which really does not help his case moving forward because yes there were A LOT of shooting fouls where Klay or Steph got right up under Paul or Harden, but then there are also times where it is clear that Harden jumps nearly 3 feet behind the arc with very little forward momentum and lands in a position where there is not a chance in hell he is going to be able to land on his feet. This was the last impression he gave the refs on that night and I think it is going to be hard to get the officiating crew to take these shooters seriously if they are not making an honest attempt of shooting the ball with out the added theatrics in look of a shooting foul

TLDR: refs got a lot wrong last night in game 1, but the fact that Harden and Paul are being too theatrical on their jumpers makes it hard for the refs to award a foul when these men go to the ground after every slightly contested 3 pointer.

Also I think Harden mentioning what happened to Kawhi is completely different because Zaza got up under him where as a lot of these jumpers from game one was the shooter purposefully compromising their own landing spot in search for a foul",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,31313,public,self,Let’s Talk About Rockets CS Warriors Game 1 And The Officiating,0,1556644171,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/birzap/lets_talk_about_rockets_cs_warriors_game_1_and/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then you take into the fact that he averaged 30.1 minutes per game that series it doesn’t look good. Six players averaged more points and the person below Joe averaged 4.4 points a game on 11.0 minutes per game. Joe also shot 27% from 3 pretty bad for someone who proclaimed he’s the best 3pt shooter in the NBA. In the regular season he done as you’d probably expect 12.1ppg 4.0trb 5.7ast. Not bad for someone in my opinion the 3rd option on a playoff team. I think Joe hurts the Jazz he’s 31 and will be turning 32 before the season starts.

I'll leave the grumbling about the referees to the other million posts about this game, and simply leave it at this. There are going to be games when the refs aren't going to give James Harden and the Rockets the benefit of the doubt (or even enforce certain rules.) In this particular game, they didn't care about landing space in the first quarter. Or second quarter. Or third quarter. Eventually, Harden and the Rockets needed to realize that -- and adjust accordingly. In games where the refs are giving Golden State a favorable whistle, Harden needs to mix up his approach and start **attacking the basket more.**
 
Moreover: Harden needs to attack the basket with an eye to SCORE. Over the last few games (dating back to the Utah series), he's been driving with an eye to pass the ball, and opponents are playing him accordingly. Specifically: they'll playing the lob to Clint Capela, and consequently disrupting that. It's made Capela less effective, and made Harden less effective within the paint (he has only shot 40.3% from two point range in this playoffs.) Harden needs to attack to score and good things will happen as a result.
 
**(2) don't engorge on Brazilian beef**
 
On the surface, Nene gave the Rockets some quality minutes in Game 1 off the bench. 3 for 3 from the field, 3 steals, and a + 7 in only 14 minutes of action. Solid! However, for the Rockets' perspective, I fear that this may be like playing with fire.
 
At 36 years old and however-many pounds, Nene can't switch on the perimeter whatsoever, and the Warriors can take advantage of that. They *tried* to take advantage of that in Game 1, with Kevin Durant and Steph Curry making a point to hunt him down on switches. Curry didn't have a monster game, but if he gets clicking, then he can roast someone like Nene.
 
From a practical perspective, the Rockets **should shelve Nene every second that Curry is on the court.** In turn, I feel this same way about Andrew Bogut and James Harden from the Warriors' perspective. Coach Steve Kerr (who can be a step slow to adjust at times) got out ahead of that issue and limited Bogut's minutes -- to the Warriors' benefit.
 
If Nene doesn't play that much, the Rockets' depth at center will be tested. But that's okay. In this series, they don't *need* to give heavy minutes to centers. When Clint Capela isn't on the court (and Curry is), it's appropriate to go ""small"" with P.J. Tucker or another big wing as your de facto center. The Warriors will most likely follow suit and match you with a small lineup of their own.
 
**(3) make up with your old buddy the corner three**
 
These Rockets don't have loads of shooting talent from their role players anymore, but they still need to have some spacing threats to help take the pressure off James Harden and Chris Paul. And as we all know, the easiest (and shortest) shot from distance is the ""corner"" three.
 
The Rockets launched 47 total threes in the game, making 14 (good for 29.8%). However, according to this [ESPN data](http://www.espn.com/nba/playbyplay?gameId=401129353&amp;wsVar=us~nba~gamepackage,desktop,en), only 5 of those 47 three point attempts came from the corners (they made 2/5 for 40%). 

Now, I am not a coach, nor even a particularly savvy fan, so perhaps the Golden State Warriors are doing something defensively to cut off those corner threes. In fact, all defenses are trying to prevent the corner threes these days, and the Warriors have long-armed wings that do a better job at that than most. However. The Rockets still need to find a way to **manufacture some easier corner threes** to help their role players like P.J. Tucker (0-3), Danuel House (1-4), and Iman Shumpert (1-4) build their confidence. I would encourage Mike D'Antoni to engineer a few corner threes for Tucker early on, if only to keep the Warriors' defense honest.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,31103,public,self,What adjustments should the Rockets make ?

Many people criticize kevin Durant and go against his character simply because he choose to go to golden state. 

For 9 years kevin Durant tried to win at OKC and he could not get it done with Russ. He then had the opportunity to go to any team that he wanted to try and win; there were many teams that he could have gone to like the spurs, Portland, Washington, and overall any good playoff team at the time. If you line those teams up the warriors were the best option for him but why?
Of all those teams the warriors were the best, he could not have gone to Cleveland because they won that year, and he doesn't want to join LeBron and help lebron's legacy but help his own. In that aspect, kevin Durant choose the best team available to him. 

Now the joining the 73-9 team argument, what if I told you that only 7/15 players on the 73-9 team would return, 2 of those 7 being a young kevon Looney( who played 5 games), and a 3rd string guard in Ian Clark. Did he really join that 73-9 team? The 73-9 team was build around overall roster, they lived by the fact that the starters could go to the bench and the bench players could maintain the lead or increase it. When they got kevin they had to sacrifice that because of cap space. 

Now let me ask, if you tried something for 9 years straight,  with a goal of accomplishing something and the way you were approaching it was not working, do you stay and continue trying to accomplish that goal after 9 years of trying or would you try to find another way? 

If you say that you would stay and keep trying with that same method, then yes you can dislike Kevin Durant because you believe that you should continue to do something the same way regardless of trying for 9 years and believe that you can accomplish that goal using that method.

If you say that you would try to find another way to accomplish that goal, then your dislike for kevin durant isn't dislike but following the crowd. If you have worked hard for 9 years, and still can't get the goal you change the approach. Yes kevon could have gone to any contending team, but let me ask, why should he not choose the best option out of those contending teams? 

It's the same thing in life, sometimes you have a lot of options that work for you, but do you not choose the one that you think is best for you? If You worked hard to get tot that point, do you nowt get the option to choose the best for yourself? Idk about you but if many offers are available to me i choose the one that i think is best for me.
 
To conclude, i simply think people either dislike kevin Durant because they are following a crowd, or they are mad because he didn't do what the wanted him to do. To which i ask, why are you getting mad about another person's decision to do what's best for themselves, if it doesn't hurt you?

This wasn’t about Game 1 of the Western Conference Semifinals, where they fell 104-100 to the Golden State Warriors and left Oracle Arena utterly convinced yet again the defending champions are getting the benefit of the whistle to a devastating degree.

This wasn’t about emotion — though there was plenty. Mike D’Antoni getting his technical in the third quarter, when he chewed on official Zach Zarba’s left ear like it was a rib-eye and nearly got tossed.

Chris Paul losing his cool in the late third quarter, and again near the end regulation when he was ejected after the latest no-call left him incensed. James Harden, whose poor shooting night (9-of-28) had everything to do with all those times he believed he should’ve been sent to the line, wanting to rip his beard out at all those points in between and saying afterward that he just wanted “a fair chance.”

Rockets general manager in Daryl Morey, whose reputation as a leader of the analytics movement is rooted in his ability to let the evidence guide one’s process, sharing his emotional reaction to it all via Twitter when he retweeted Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban after the game.

Daryl Morey ✔ @dmorey Been working on things since 2006 ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Mark Cuban ✔ @mcuban 2 minute report is going to be very interesting tomorrow. Will tell you so much about the management of the nba officiating group

No, this was about the NBA’s most analytically minded organization deciding long ago that all the data in this heavy-hitter matchup proves their point: The Warriors, as they see it, are getting the kind of officiating edge that simply must be stopped. And Game 1 – which was refereed by Zarba, Josh Tiven and Courtney Kirkland – confirmed their fears that this playoff battle with the Warriors might be just as painful as the last when it comes to the officiating.

By the Rockets’ internal count from their video crew, there were eight attempted 3-pointers that should have been fouls in Game 1 – good for 24 free throw attempts that would’ve certainly decided the game. There was insult added to injury on that front as well, with D’Antoni and Harden both saying officials told them at halftime they had missed foul calls on four Rockets 3-point attempts.

But make no mistake, this is much bigger than one game.

According to sources with knowledge of the situation, the Rockets have been making a data-driven case with the NBA for quite some time that these Super Team Warriors are getting a major officiating advantage in these heavy-hitter matchups. And of all the specific examples that have been discussed with league officials, none has left them more suspect of the system than the 2018 Western Conference Finals. This series opener, more than anything, was salt being poured directly into that Rockets wound.

When that series ended nearly a year ago, the Rockets’ research had just begun. They secured the play-by-play officiating reports from each game from the NBA – a service that is afforded to individual teams (teams aren’t given reports for other teams, which makes it hard to compare). These reports document the league’s verdict on correct calls and missed calls in the same way as the Last Two Minute reports that are shared publicly, with the obvious difference being that it accounts for all 48 minutes of action.

And after the Rockets went through every line, tallying all the missed calls for each team and adding up the potential points that were lost along the way, it wasn’t pretty: The Rockets, according to the sources, had a double-digit point deficit in six of the seven games (and a small edge in Game 2). In all, sources say, they were harmed to the tune of 93 points. Game 7 was the worst, the research showed, with the league-issued report indicating they should have had 18 more points. More specifically, two of the 27 consecutive missed 3-pointers that did them in were ruled to have been missed foul calls.

What’s more, the same “landing space” play that had the Rockets furious after Game 1 was a major point of frustration during that series – especially after their Game 7 loss, and with D’Antoni as upset as anyone over the matter. As detailed in this “NBA Video Rulebook” breakdown, defenders are required to allow shooters to “safely return to the floor.”

The vertical jump shots are the easiest to officiate, but the rule also applies to plays in which the shooter’s momentum carries him to a spot that’s different from where the jump originated. The historical backdrop of this debate wasn’t lost on Rockets officials, either: In September 2017, the NBA instituted a rule that allowed officials to call a flagrant or technical if the defender “recklessly positioned his foot in an unnatural way” under the shooter; the rule was inspired by then-Golden State center Zaza Pachulia’s placement of his foot under Kawhi Leonard during the 2017 Western Conference Finals, when the then-San Antonio star had his season ended by that ankle injury.

“Call the game how it’s supposed to be called and that’s it,” Harden said. “And I’ll live with the results. … We all know what happened a few years back with Kawhi. That can change the entire series. Just call the game the way it’s supposed to be called and we’ll live with the results. It’s plain and simple.”

To that end, the Rockets also believe another one of their allegations was confirmed yet again in Game 1: The notion that the league’s more experienced officials are far less willing to call this play in accordance with the rules, as compared to younger officials. Sources say the Rockets raised this research-inspired complaint with the NBA months ago, and it didn’t help matters in their eyes that this game fell right in line with that theory (Zarba is in his 16th season, Tiven is in his ninth, and Kirkland is in his 19th).

When Morey sent that tweet, which will likely lead to his latest fine, the “2006” mention sparked an obvious flashback: Cuban’s Mavericks lost to Miami in the 2006 Finals, which remains among the most controversial in the league’s history when it comes to the officiating. But there was another key event that year as well, as Morey left the Boston Celtics to join the Rockets as an assistant general manager in April 2006 en route to building this team he wants so badly to end this Warriors run and win the franchise’s first title since 1995.

If they don’t get the calls they believe they deserve this time around, though, this debate will likely rage on into yet another disappointing finish.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,30360,public,self,Sources: Rockets’ Game 1 ref rage rooted in extensive Warriors research – The Athletic,0,1556602230,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/bilsg0/sources_rockets_game_1_ref_rage_rooted_in/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I also think Toronto and Golden State are in a pretty good spot.   
 However, the Denver vs. Portland matchup really baffles me, as I can't quite figure out who should theoretically have the edge here.

&amp;#x200B;

I think recency bias really makes a lot of the fans bullish on Dame Time, and I do think the analytics overcompensate for regular season performance, when teams aren't doing as much between-game stuff and mostly just going from place to place to ball out.  That said, people have brought up the issue of Denver having a potentially favorable matchup, especially with Nurkic's injury.  Some things that I want to consider...how did the Pelicans sweep the Blazers last year, and does Denver have the tools to force the Blazers into those unfavorable matchup situations?

**Takeaways:**

* LeBron averaged 4.7 3PT assists in 2016-17. Since this time, only Steph and Harden have averaged more 3fgm in a season.
* LeBron’s 3PT assist per game dropped big time this year (only 2.65 per game)   
 

**Why?**

Read this crazy line from a Kirk Goldsberry article:

“Over the past five seasons, Curry has emerged as a new kind of scoring wunderkind, draining an incredible 1,485 3-pointers since 2013-14 season. But in that same period, James the creator has assisted on 1,318 made triples.”

&amp;#x200B;

**Method:**

* LeBron 3pt assists: for each game LeBron has played in over the last 3 years, get the play-by-play and filter for 3pt made shots      that Lebron got the assist for.
* Other NBA players: get league leaders in 3pt fg for the last 3 years and sort them.

It seems like the questions are and typically a big softball, or worded so poorly that the player has two either give a generic answer or be frustrated. There are of course a few good reporters who come in with solid questions but well over half of them seem like they have never asked a question in a sports setting before.

I have a couple theories, maybe someone can can agree or disprove them.
1. They know the sound bite of a player responding poorly to a reporter because of a bad question will be really popular.
2. They know the answer to the question will only be a surface level response, the player wouldn't give away in-depth scouting or analysis that the team had actually done.
