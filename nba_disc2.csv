I came back to the league around 2016 and have followed it closely ever since, slowly picking up names and figuring out what happened to the ones I followed in the 90s.

Here's some of the stuff I've picked up over the last few years. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

*  Tim Duncan has been more important to the Spurs franchise than David Robinson. 
*  There was a rather good player called Steve Nash who never won a title, and someone trading him away from some other guy called Dirk and back to the Suns is to blame for that.
* LeBron (I did hear of him) made a decision and it was a big deal. 
* Hakeem Olajuwon and Dikembe Mutombo made decisions too, but it was just kinda sad. 
* Literally no one talks about Shawn Kemp anymore.
* Plenty of people talk about Ray Allen though. I find this interesting. 
* Damian Lillard is just as likeable, if not more, than Clyde Drexler was.
* Latrell Sprewell's career never really recovered from that choking thing.
* James Harden is ""the guard Karl Malone"".
* It's only because the league has moved from being a slow big man in the post-kinda game to a quick pick n roll three point-kinda game that Dwight Howard is regarded as a superstar.
* There was a guy called Elton Brand and another one called Yao Ming.
* People still prefer college Chris Webber to NBA Chris Webber.

Throughout this season, only his second in the league, he's legitimately been a top 10 offensive threat while shooting incredible percentages for his sheer volume at such a young age. His passing has been world class as well, being second in the league in assists, while his advanced passing numbers (AST%, Potential AST, points off of AST) all paint a similarly elite picture. On offence, it's honestly hard to find fault in his play, since even what could be construed as at times poor shot selection is mitigated by the fact that he can regularly make his pull up threes from the logo. With such a refined offensive skillset at the age of only 21, what even is a fair projection of what his career could be?

His defence, while questionable effort wise, isn't as awful as many people make it out to be commonly. Most of his mistakes and lapses are as a result of effort, and I believe as his offensive game develops as will his defensive effort, leading to a lessening of the boneheaded mistakes he occasionally makes on the floor. I can however see why his defence would hold people back from believing he could truly become an all time great.

For me, taking into account his offensive skillset at such a young age and the fact that his weaknesses aren't unable to be fixed considering his age, my honest projection for his career is that of a top 30-25 all timer. Now many may say this is too ambitious, but I would honestly be disappointed if he achieved less than this. I feel he has the ability and the drive to be a Steph Curry type of Point Guard, and I'll be truly saddened if he doesn't reach that potential by the time his career is over.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,79031,public,self,What is a realistic career expectatiom for Trae Young?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/f7rrgc/what_is_a_realistic_career_expectatiom_for_trae/,some_ads,7.0,099e778a-8b9a-11e8-b53d-0eebf66bed8a,Player Discussion,,,,,,,

Obviously I would try to play giannis off and be as phisical as possible trying to throw off his center of gravity like kawhi did and hope the refs don't blow the whistle, and just in general defend them in some way that tries to bet on the shooting percentages of guys like brook lopez who is having a terrible shooting season, his brother, bledsoe, pat who can't really shoot, divincenzo etc.   


Also their defense, especially on the inside seems really unstoppable, and the lakers offense is centered around the guy who is maybe the best ever at getting to the rim, lebron james, who now is 35 and has taken a step back in that regard if you check the stats, and AD, who is a monster but isn't really reliable with his midrange as people seem to think he is. Really the only way to dismantle their defense seems to me kawhi going nuclear from the midrange like in last year playoffs, shooting 55-60% in the series for like 5 baskets a game and like 3 3s a game with 40+, I don't really see a team who wants to go inside beating them.  


Maybe you can try to blitz me but again, I can't make up a clear, like, step by step image of something that would work against them if you are not the peak golden state warriors.

It has piqued my interest about NBA coaching hires in general and made me dig into NBA coaching history.

I do however, think that line is a bit over stated.

Now I don't hold that position because I can disprove that college coaches are better in the NBA than you might think. The fact of the matter is that we have multiple examples of college coaches not making it in the NBA. There just aren't a lot of direct college to NBA hires to base that statement on. With that said, the best examples we have in the past 20-30 years are Brad Stevens, Billy Donovan, and Rick Pitino (mostly his Knicks stint). You could throw PJ Carlesimo in there for sheer amount of tries (5 teams), but his 239-315 NBA record isn't exactly inspiring. Needless to say though, it's not exactly the most shining list.

What this really led me to is how NBA teams are hiring coaches. According to Basketball Reference, there have been 193 NBA coaches who have started their NBA careers since 1980. Only 12 of those coaches came directly from D1. 13 if you count Larry Brown coming from Kansas, but he started his career in the ABA/NBA, went to college, and came back.

Retread coaches are quite popular in the NBA as well. Of those 193 coaches, 86 of them were retreads (coaches who coached multiple NBA teams). And that's simply coaches who coached for more than one team, I didn't break it down by coaches who coached more than 2 teams like PJ Carlesimo (5 teams) or Byron Scott (4 teams). Now obviously this list also includes guys like Phil Jackson and Pat Riley who were legendary coaches who coached for multiple teams or even respectable coaches like Flip Saunders or Frank Vogel who have carved out nice head coaching careers with multiple teams. Not all retreads are bad, but the number is certainly staggering.

Just to throw some more stats at you, 43 of those 193 coaches only lasted 1 year or less. 24 lasted 2 years.

Of the 86 retreads, 54 of them had a .500 record or worse. The coach with the most games at a below .500 record is Mike Dunleavy Sr. with 1329 games at a .461 win percentage. There are 39 retread coaches with over 300 games as a head coach have an under .500 win percentage. The worst of those is Sidney Lowe with 307 games and .257 winning percentage. A recent example on this list is Byron Scott who had a whopping 1101 games as an NBA head coach with just a .412 winning percentage.

Just to touch on the positive hires. 32 of the retreads had a .500 record or better. Phil Jackson leads this pack in win % at .704. Jerry Sloan has the lead in games at 2024 with a win percentage of .603. What may surprise some is Mike Brown is 3rd on this list (behind Jackson and Riley) in win percentage at .616. At the bottom of this list Terry Stotts just makes the cut with 913 games at a .509 win percentage.

Anyway, my point of this post isn't a hot take or anything like that. I'm not sure if I even have much of a point to make. It was just interesting to dig into the data and see how few coaches have come directly from college and how many guys have stayed in the NBA and gotten multiple chances. I do think there are big differences between college and NBA ball, but we just have a very small sample size with the college coaches. I think it'd be interesting if in the future we saw more college guys get opportunities to really test the theory.

If you guys want to know anything else, I've got a spreadsheet on these coaches and would be happy to discuss/share more of my findings. In this post I just shared a few of the most notable stats to me.

This descended into a debate over whether they could be called the ""best offense of all time"" or whether this is simply due to our era being offense-friendly.

A lot of people claimed that this was due to changes in defensive rules and statflation so offenses like the 2003-04 Mavericks who beat the league average by a wider variation under tougher defensive rules that allowed both zone and hand checking were ""better offenses.""

On the other hand I and others argued that advances in analytics resulted in better offenses in general, that today's better offenses might beat the average of past eras by an even bigger margin if sent back in time, and that those exact historic offenses would not be as good relative to average in this era if run exactly the same today because they were midrange-heavy. 

If you assume those past offenses change completely today (i.e. that 2003-04 Nash and Dirk would take a higher volume of threes due to laxer perimeter defense), or that the current Mavs would be forced by stricter defense rules to change their offense in a different era, you start diving into speculation.

Since we can never know whether league rule changes vs. advances in offensive design contributed more to the result, I'd rather hold up the better result in an era where the average is much higher as the ""best"" and qualify that.

**How far does this ""relative to average matters more"" logic go?**

In 1982-83, the league average 3 point percentage was 23.8%. That year Mike Dunleavy led the league in 3PAs (194) and 3P% (34.5%), so +10.7 over league average. Meanwhile in 2015-16, when Steph Curry won unanimous MVP, his 3P% (45.4%) was only +10 over league average (35.4%). Would anyone claim 1982-83 Mike Dunleavy the ""better three point shooter"" simply because he outperformed his era's terrible average by more? Even though his ""best"" average was below the average of the entire 2015-16 league?

The central problem with the relative to average argument is that priorities are constantly shifting. In the past, at first three point shooting was seen as a gimmick, then as something only good shooters should even attempt. Now it's something teams like Dallas and Houston are building the vast majority of their offense around from top to bottom.

Today we take more threes and less midrange shots and post ups than ever because analytics became a thing. As a result, players expectations of becoming an at least decent three point shooter at nearly every position might affect league averages. When you have centers across the league taking more three pointers, the league average 3P% falling is a natural expectation. On the other hand, everybody is practicing and prioritizing it so averages overall may rise or fall depending on the distribution of shooting vs. quality of shooter.. 

Conclusion 

While fluctuations in league average and changes in league rules are relevant to results, trying to use relativity to league average as the basis for what counts as the ""best x ever"" is a hugely flawed approach. If you drop Steph or Seth Curry or prime Kyle Korver into 1982-83 with current skill and knowledge intact, he's going to blow away Mike Dunleavy's league-leading percentage, even if he has a somewhat down year due to hand checking rules. Transport Dunleavy to this era and he might shoot with his previous skill and knowledge intact and he might shoot better with laxer defense, but unlikely to approach the great shooters of today.

These finals are widely regarded as a Rigged NBA Finals. It is believed that it was set for the Heat to win the finals. Evidence sets as follows: 

Wade’s Scored a total of 208 points in the finals and made 75/97 free throws (highest mavs player is dirk at 55 attempted): 36.5% of his points were scored off of free throws. Heat shot 207 free throws to the Mavs 155. He shot a total of 97 free throws in the series. Wade vs Mavs free throws totals ---- Game 1 10 to 16 MAVS WIN GAME. Game 2 14 to 25 MAVS WIN GAME. Game 3 18 to 27 HEAT WIN GAME. Game 4 9 to 27 HEAT WIN GAME. Game 5 25 to 25 HEAT WIN GAME. Game 6 21 to 23 HEAT WIN GAME. 

NBA ref Tim Donaghy (nba ref that rigged games) states that “I knew for the get go that dallas didn’t have a chance in the nba finals, people in the nba front office had no love for Cuban and the majority of the nba referees had even less. As the series began shifting back to Miami the league office began flooding game 3 and game 4 referees with video plays from games 1 and 2 that the higher ups felt should have been called in favor of Miami the message was predictable and very clear: Miami was going to have an advantage in its own building, thus prolonging the series and socking it to mark Cuban. With millions of dollars on the line, a sweep by the mavs was out of the question”.  


Dirk was able to beat the nba’s first superteam all by himself in a 4-2 series win (3 all stars v 1, not to mention wade also had arguably the greatest player of all time on his team and in his prime of Lebron). Wade led his team in scoring of 26.5 points per game to Lebron 18.5, which still wasn’t enough to beat the Mavs. Dirk has also never had the star power beside him in his entire career. Wade had just out of his prime Shaq (who still was considered one of the best Centers in the league) in the 2006 finals to the mavs second best player in Jason Terry. And then the best player on earth for his next 4 finals appearances. Wade’s best record without an all star beside him  47-35 to worst 15-67. Dirk’s best record without an all star beside him 60-22 to worst 19-31 (Rookie Year). Dirk changes the game for big men. After all of this I just don’t see how these guys are on the same level when Dirk can put up similar if not better numbers throughout his career with so much less around him. It seems like for Wade to win he always need help around him, when Dirk could do it all by himself for so long.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,78909,public,self,DWade's career cannot match up to the legendary career of Dirk Nowitizki,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/f76jph/dwades_career_cannot_match_up_to_the_legendary/,some_ads,7.0,099e778a-8b9a-11e8-b53d-0eebf66bed8a,Player Discussion,,,,,,,

Zion Williamson is a breath of freshness with which he also brings a bit of old school basketball.

After 10 NBA games in which he gave us many highlights and wonderful moves with phenomenal numbers, we already have enough games, data and actions to analyze Zion and his style.

First, I have to say that the level of hype around Zion before, during and after the draft was definitely the highest in the last ten years. The one closest to Zion is probably Ben Simmons with comparisons to LeBron, but it still seems to me that Zion and the story around him is much bigger than Simmons.

## Things to work on

When I read his draft profile now, the most commonly mentioned negative sides were:

* Bad mid-range, three point shot.

* Poor when playing back-to-basket.

* Relying on strength in offense (alluding to the fact that this will not be possible in the NBA league).

* Bad efficiency from FT line.

And now that I've looked at the first ten games and watched Zion in great detail on how he plays, I can safely say that this is still true. Relying on strength is obviously not a problem, because he has absolutely blown everyone in front of him so far.

There is no shot from the mid-range/three-point range, it looks weird and he doesn't shoot that much (those 4 3PT made against the Spurs in the first game is a huge anomaly obviously). If you look at the [Shot Chart I made](https://i.imgur.com/fqZflem.png), you will see that Zion scored all but 8 shots from the Restricted Area. This is quite worrying to me, but on the other hand, very fascinating. Free throws have also remained a problem, with 65.4% being a fairly low percentage, and given that he is 9th in the league in free throws per game, this skill would greatly help him and his team if he were at an even higher percentage.

I would attribute the poor play of the back to the basket to the fact that he is not very skilled with the right (weaker) hand. This was most prominent against the Bucks (well, it is true that they are by far the best defensive team in the league) when Brook Lopez and Giannis shut him down. He was constantly directed at using his right hand, to which he responded with spins to his left hand and excellent pump fakes. But the ability to finish with the right hand is essential, especially with his style of play.

## Strenghts

### Next level rebounding

But all of these things are correctable, as many players have shown, it is possible to learn to shoot efficientlyeffectively. Right hand and post play can be straithened up through one summer. But those things that can't be learned, which you either have or don't have, Zion has in huge quantities.

Zion does not give up when he misses a layup or shot and fights to get offensive board. He's scary in that segment. 8th in the league in offensive rebounds per game, with all players ahead of him being at roughly 3 inches at least taller than him. As you can see in this [chart](https://i.imgur.com/5rBCYmT.png), ([here is version with cm instead of inches](https://i.imgur.com/bm4kEQp.png)), there is no other player who is less than 2 meters and has more than 2 rebounds in attack. The will, motor and the constant work is something that is visible ""from the plane"" with Zion, and it is the right recipe for the road to success.

Also, when looking at the ratio of [offensive and defensive rebounds](https://i.imgur.com/LysAv4X.png), Zion has almost more offensive rebounds than defensive. Only a handful of players came close to such feat along with him, and one of them is Montrezl Harrell. 

## Comparisons

Harrell is the player who currently most resembles Zion with his style of play, constitution, athleticism and skill. Both are awesome athletes and undersized Big Men, Harrell is 2.01m high (6ft 7) and Zion is 1.98m (6ft 6). They both score almost all of their points from the [restricted area](https://i.imgur.com/IR6rzzk.png). Both are also technically capable and know how to drive to the hoop. The only difference between the two is perhaps that Harrell relies more on Pick And Roll, and Zion relies more on Post game.

If you were to draw a parallel with some of the older players, Charles Barkley is a perfect comparison. The same height as Zion and very similar physique and athletic ability, Barkley terrorized the NBA while in a Philadelphia jersey. If someone were to offer the Pelicans Chuck's career in the form of Zion, of course with a couple of titles ;), I doubt they would complain. Other comparison would be Larry Johnson, who also has similar style and body.

## Conclusion

As the first sentence/title says, Zion brought a touch of freshness and old school basketball, and it's really a treat to watch a 19-year-old play around with experienced NBA players like he does. All I want is for him to stay healthy and then he will surely show his full potential, which is already present and visible.

At the time, this was seen as a great trade for the Wolves. Obtaining a legit number 1 option for a team sorely in need of a veteran presence was a home run move even considering what it took to get him.

However, now that we look back on it, knowing what happened after (the Wolves made the playoffs once and Butler was traded mid next season to the Sixers for Dario and RoCo), was the trade worth it for the Wolves?  They gave up a solid defensive/playmaking PG and a dude in Lavine who looks like he could be a second/third option on a championship team (My opinion), plus a pick which could've been anyone from Markkanen, to Donovan Mitchell, to John Collins (though their scouting would have to be top notch to hit some of those.)

As many of you already know, Jason Collins came out as the NBA's first openly gay player in 2013. As society gradually is becoming more and more accepting of the LGBTQ+ community, do you think we will start to see more NBA players coming out as gay? [Considering about 3.9% of male individuals identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/visualization/lgbt-stats/?topic=LGBT&amp;characteristic=male#density) nationwide, and assuming each team's roster has about 15 players, the league should currently have about 17 players who identify as a member of the LBGTQ+ community.

That number is just an average, of course, and I'm sure other factors would come into play as well, but it seems that according to statistics, at least a handful of players might identify as non-cis.

What are your thoughts? Perhaps there really are no LGBTQ+ players in the league right now? Maybe only a few? Or, maybe those who are LGBTQ+ are afraid to come out for some reason or another? Moreover, do you think any current players ARE LGBTQ+, and if so, which ones? Dwight Howard has been in the news a couple times concerning this, and maybe others are gay as well (Trae Young? KAT? The Boston Celtics? It could be anyone really, and we might never know!). Hopefully, if there truly are any LGBTQ+ players in the league right now, they will feel safe coming out both to their teammates and to the public.

I originally thought I could come up with a metric that gave different weights to shots based on distance from the hoop. I abandoned this idea, however, upon the obvious realization that a 2-footer is worth just as many points as a shot from 15 feet. So this was the metric that I finally decided to go with in an attempt to rate scoring efficiency in the NBA.

Let me know your thoughts below. 

**League Adjusted Scorer Efficiency Rating (LASER)**

LASER is calculated by taking each player's shot breakdown - free throws, two point attempts, and three point attempts - and calculating how efficiently they score from each range, relative to the league average. A free throw is given a weight of one, two point attempts a weight of two, and three point attempts a weight of three. 

A player who is exactly average in how they score will have a LASER of zero. Anything above zero implies more efficient than average, and a negative number implies less efficient than average. 

For purposes of keeping observations clean, I am only including in this post players who have played 500+ total minutes as of the All Star break.

**Conclusions**

I was pretty happy overall with how the metric came out, and think it matches the eye test or basic shooting stats test pretty well. I also think it is interesting how close all of the Western Conference contenders are: Utah, Denver, and both LA teams have 7 efficient scorers each, and Dallas with their super-offense comes in with 8.

Carter  didn't play for the remainder of the regular season. But the Raptors  went on to win 12 of their last 14 to make the seventh seed and the  Playoffs.

I didn't factor in the original team bit at all, but I looked at every player who played 2000 minutes in a season and had an on/off plus/minus of 10.0, and while they were not playing, the team played at a -5 plus/minus.  Also this data on goes back as far as 2000-2001, as that was the oldest play by play data I could find.  


Two exceptions were made, the 2011-2012 season which was shortened due to lockout, so anyone with a minimum 1609 minutes played was included, and the current season (2019-2020), anyone with a minimum 1292 minutes played was included.  The minutes cutoff was just to match the amount of minutes played per 82 games, reduced to 66 games (2011-2012 season) and reduced to 50 games (least amount of games played so far this season, Washington).  


The results can be a little clunky, and a big factor seems to be the coach of the team.  I repeatedly saw the same coach on a different team 5 years down the road kind of thing, with like 8 different coaches, so it's clearly just the preference to do platoon swaps with some people, and other teams like to circulate players in.  Most good (50+ win teams) are the former.  Literally Draymond Green is listed despite being on the greatest regular season team ever, because the team was -7.8 with him off the court, which you could probably make of them having blown out a team by 30 in the 3rd quarter and the bench guys would fill in to end the game, or something of that nature.  Another example is the 2005-2006 New Jersey Nets, four of the team's five starters qualified for this, and no offence to Nenad Krstic, I don't think he's in the same echelon as Steph Curry, who has also only done it once, but aside from the five starters everyone on the Nets team was a pretty poor player.  


Anyways, this is all just for the sake of something to look at.  I think it not a bad list of ""Huh, this guy might be underrated historically because he had very little help through a few years of his career.""  I think if I had more time, the one thing I would add is a minimum USG%, as a lot of people aren't particularly carrying their team, but just happen to fit in to an offensive niche really well and be good defenders.  USG% seems like the most opaque way to lob off a lot of names in that category.   


The list of players with at least 3 seasons meeting the requirements of 2000+ MP, +10.0 on/off +/-, and a -5.0 off court +/- are, as such:  


6 seasons - LeBron James  
5 seasons - Vince Carter, Chris Paul  
4 seasons - Kevin Garnett, Jason Kidd, Dirk Nowitzki  
3 seasons - Mike Conley, Andrei Kirilenko, Tracy McGrady, Paul Pierce, Dwyane Wade  


[Here's the full link to my data to anyone curious, has a season-by-season analysis with their on/off and off +/- data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12cx5Arm2phK4J0aqxzA7o0Tj_gWnYLYsaBEQixTm018/edit?usp=sharing)  


Some general surprises to me:   


John Stockton qualified in 2000-2001 despite being 38, which if I remember right he was the oldest person on the list.  Have to imagine he would've made it a bunch more with the Jazz if there was older data for it.  


Just some of the random names who made it once: Nenad Krstic, Ryan Anderson, rookies Shane Battier and Pau Gasol for the Memphis Grizzlies, Elfrid Payton, Joe Harris currently on pace, etc.  


Some historically great teams being top-heavy enough that players would still qualify: Shaq on the '01 Lakers, '03 Spurs Duncan, 2016 Draymond.  


Mike Conley and Andrei Kirilenko qualifying three times.  Conley had a bit of the ""good starting line-up bad backups"" help, but Kirilenko had legitimately no one close to him on the team for his three years qualifying in regards to plus/minus.  


Also, for the current season there's currently 4 players on pace to qualify.  
Damian Lillard, who would do it for his second time (consecutively)  
Rudy Gobert, who is part of that ""offensive niche good defender"" category  
and Devonte' Graham and Joe Harris who both feel like guys out of no where.  


\-19.3 Shane Battier Grizzlies '02  
\-17.5 Kevin Garnett Wolves '03  
\-16.0 Pau Gasol Grizzlies '02  
\-15.5 Vince Carter Nets '08  
\-15.3 Kevin Garnett Wolves '07  
\-15.3 Devonte' Graham Hornets '20  


Devonte' is tied for being on the 5th worst team without him among qualified, and while Pau Gasol and Shane Battier stick out for not belonging as well, they were also teammates so I can sort of lump them as ""good starters/really atrocious bench,"" it just seems really surprising how impactful Graham is for the Hornets, especially since it's, you know, happening right now.

The first draft seemed to go pretty much about as you would expect but as more drafts went on the strategies got a lot more unique. Certain players started going higher because they were more scalable/easier to build with, point guards and centers were generally valued much lower due to their positions being so stacked compared to the wing positions, people started valuing players from before the 1980s much lower because of past voting results.

So after hosting five of these drafts and people catching onto strategies and trends that worked in voting results in past ones, I compiled the average draft position of the first round throughout all five of them, along with their most commonly drafted season and I am curious to see other people’s opinions on it:

The darker the area, the more opponents shoot from that area compared to the rest of the league.](https://imgur.com/awe958g)

***

You can tell a lot about a defense by the types of shots they allow. One of the hallmarks of a great defense is forcing opposing teams to take shots they don't want to take. Or to put it another way, teams that force their opponents to settle for inefficient shots are often going to come out ahead. At the same time, it's worth wondering how long can a team survive while giving up some of the most efficient shots in basketball. 

Using data from the NBA, I looked at every shot taken this season to find patterns in the types of shots that defenses allow. You can read more about my methodology at the bottom of this post, but the gist of it is I calculated how often every team shoots from every part of the court. 

##[This chart shows where opposing teams shoot from, relative to league average](https://imgur.com/awe958g)##

Darker areas on the court indicate opponents of that team take a higher higher amount of attempts from the corresponding area compared to the rest of the league. Blank areas show where opponents of that team shoot at or below league average volume. 

For example, take a look at the patch of dark green in the mid-range for the Bucks. That means the Bucks force their opponents to take more mid-range attempts much more often than most teams. A similar story can be said for the Nets, Jazz, and 76ers, all of whom boast top 10 defenses.

Meanwhile, the Raptors have almost no red in their mid-range. That means their opponents don't take many from that area. However, they do have a lot of red in the corner three area. The Raptors allow more corner 3s than anyone else. However, since opponents are sinking only 35.4% of their corner 3s against Toronto (3rd lowest % this season) they've maintained one of the top defenses in the NBA. [Could be intentional (meaning the Raptors are conceding corner 3s to bad shooters).](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/f5w21o/torontos_defense_consists_of_a_high_amount_of/) Or it could be luck. We don't know either way for sure

Methodology: 

I charted every shot taken this season and binned them into similarly sized hexagons. I then found out the league average number of attempts from each hexagon and calculated how many standard deviations away from the mean opponents of each team were from each hexagon. The darker the color on the chart, the higher the deviation.

I, also, very much underestimated the Raptors and the regular-season Lakers.

The lowdown is that, **despite the growth of the NBA and thus the resources teams have at their disposal, they seem to have gotten *worse* at drafting,** although I think there are a few possible explanations that highlight the incentives driving the decisions of modern NBA teams.
(For a more thorough account, see [my writeup here](https://quantimschmitz.com/2020/02/16/have-nba-general-managers-gotten-better-at-drafting).)

**The Question** 

Have NBA teams gotten better at selecting the best available player in the draft?

**The Method (Roughly)**

We want to know if NBA teams have gotten better at selecting the best player available when it's their chance to draft, regardless of whether the best available player is LeBron James or Hedo Türkoğlu. I ranked first round draft picks by their total career win shares each year of the draft from 1979 to 2015, and then found [Spearman's ρ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient) for each draft year, which measures the correlation between the ranks between two lists (in this case, the number of the draft pick and the career win shares of player selected with that draft pick). If every team always selects the best player available, Spearman's ρ will be one. If teams selected randomly, Spearman's ρ will be around 0. **So the closer Spearman's ρ is to one, the better teams did at drafting, and the lower Spearman's ρ is, the worse teams did at drafting,** at least according to this metric.

**Draft Competence Over Time**

[Here's what happens when we look at our Spearman's ρ over the years](https://i.imgur.com/DcLHOnA.png)

Teams clearly seem to have gotten worse at drafting over the years. There is a fairly strong correlation between (R = -.79; R^2 = .62), so *something* seems to have changed over time to make NBA teams at least *look* like they've gotten worse at drafting. Why might this be?

**Possible Explanations**

These explanations aren't mutually exclusive; I think there is a good chance that each is true to some extent.

*Drafting Got Harder*

As basketball has grown in popularity, NBA team have had to make decisions among a larger number of prospects and among prospects who have been playing against a wider variety of competition, and deciding whether that European kid is better than the Duke player is particularly hard when they have been playing against different competition and with slightly different rules.

*NBA Teams are Looking for Things not Captured by Win Shares*

Win shares aren't a perfect metric, and maybe NBA teams have come to value *precisely the things* that win shares don't capture. (I think this *might* offer a partial explanation, but win shares still do a pretty good job of tracking how good players are widely considered to be, so I highly doubt that this could fully explain what is going on.)

*NBA Teams Have Adopted a Different Drafting Strategy*

This is the most interesting possible explanation, in my opinion. The metric I used assumes that teams are always trying to draft the player who has the best expected value of career win shares. But what if teams are drafting for a player's ceiling, even if he is unlikely to reach that ceiling, rather than how good they expect a player is most likely to be? Getting a good-but-not-great player can help a team move up into the realm of average teams, but getting from average to great is really hard. However, getting a high-risk, high-reward player can make your team great if he pans out, or leave your team terrible enough to get another high draft pick (and another swing at a high-ceiling player) if he doesn't. I'll probably follow up on this idea sometime in the future.

Doing the proper  analysis and being consistent in all parts of making a prediction is not  feasible when it is done manually. Some level of luck is always needed  in ports betting, but when it comes to soccer, you need to be a bit more  luckier than the level of luck you would need in NBA betting. Here are  some statistical facts:      

&amp;#x200B;

* Unlike  soccer, there are only 2 potential final results for each match: Win or  Lose. Since ""tie"" is not an option for the final result of the match,  it significantly reduces the level of risk you take.
* Compared  to soccer, a lot more points are scored in a basketball match. As the  number of points increases in a sports competition, the risk of seeing  unexpected results decreases. You maybe see - say - 3 goals in a soccer  match that determines the winner at the end. But in a basketball match  in NBA, teams tend to score around 200 points in one single match. The  better team is always closer to winning the match.
* In  soccer, the team that scores a goal mostly starts moving around the  ball instead of seeking new goals and they do it for consuming the time.  In basketball, each team has at most 24 seconds to finalize their  attack. This increases the significance of one single goal quite a lot  in soccer but one point is not equally significant in basketball.
* In  a given league in soccer, teams mostly play one single match every  week. In NBA, teams play almost every single day. There is a chance for  making faster profit in NBA if it is done wisely.
* If  a player gets red card in a soccer match, that player leaves the game  and his team continues the game with 1 less player. This becomes a huge  disadvantage for the team that has lost its player, and it is a valid  concern even for the strongest teams that are expected to win their  matches. In basketball, if a player makes 6 fouls, he still needs to  leave the game but another player replaces him so that the team never  plays the game with 1 less player.
* For whatever reason, odds tend to be higher for NBA matches and many bookmakers provide generous handicap betting options.

By  using advanced predictive models, it is still possible to predict the  expected winner of both soccer and NBA matches.

______________________________________

Note: my line of questioning was spurred on after reading this excellent X and O's breakdown of the Toronto Raptors defense by Mike Prada called, [""How the Raptors' defense is making other teams see ghosts"".](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/2/12/21129554/toronto-raptors-defense-nick-nurse-zone-box-and-one-trap-switch-analysis)

I highly recommend checking out that link because it features video clips and gifs. But if you don't want to click, the following paragraphs contain the meat of the analysis:

&gt; Collectively, Toronto’s frantic closeouts and quick-thinking switching make opponents feel pressured in moments where they should feel comfortable. Shots that are objectively “open” against Toronto often feels like they’re too contested to take, but when opponents choose to drive instead, they’re bound to find someone unexpected cutting off their path before they even get started. Their only choice is to restart the process with another drive-and-kick that hopefully yields a less stressful situation for a teammate.
&gt; 
&gt; Sometimes — nay, often, it does, but Toronto’s OK with that. This seems counterintuitive on many levels. Historically, the league’s best defense are the ones which limit three-point attempts rather than three-point percentage, because they have much more control over the former than the latter. Yet four out of every 10 Raptors opponents’ shots are threes, the highest rate in the league. More significantly, Toronto yields the highest proportion of corner threes in the NBA, according to Cleaning the Glass, and the difference between them and 29th-place Miami is larger than the difference between the Heat and 10th-place Detroit.
&gt; 
&gt; If the goal of a defense is to limit high-efficiency shots, Toronto’s would fail spectacularly. Cleaning the Glass uses a metric known as Shooting Location Effective Field Goal Percentage, which estimates how well an opponent would shoot if they converted the shots a defense gives up at a league-average rate. Based on this, Toronto’s defense should surrender an effective field goal percentage of 53.7 percent, the sixth-worst mark in the league. Instead, the Raptors actually hold opponents an effective field goal percentage of just 50.8 percent, mere percentage points behind Brooklyn and the Clippers for the second-best mark in the league. Since 2014, only two other teams (the 2016-17 Warriors and 2017-18 Celtics) have maintained a wider positive disparity between those two numbers over a whole season. Usually, those large discrepancies indicate good fortune and stabilize over time.
&gt; 
&gt; But there’s a growing case that Toronto is actually the exception to this rule. Teams may get juicy three-point looks against them, but only after surviving what seems like a never-ending a gauntlet of closeouts, switches, and traps. This shot is “open” in literal terms, because there’s no defender in sight.
&gt; 
&gt; Those numbers also don’t account for the many “open” shots teams pass up, only to turn the ball over because they feel the Raptors’ footsteps. Toronto is second in the league in live-ball turnovers, second in points off turnovers, and tops in most points added per 100 possessions via steals. They strike quickly off the many mistakes they force, which only stresses their opponents out even more.
&gt; 
&gt; Nurse’s deployment of a shapeshifting defense with pressure as the foundational principle is unconventional and creative, but hardly unprecedented. In the early and mid 1990s, the Seattle SuperSonics emerged as a defensive powerhouse using Bob Kloppenburg’s “SOS” system, a frantic style of play that was often seen as a gimmick by its detractors. Among the core tenants of the system: switch all 2-on-2 screens, defend each action with all five guys, and force opponents to vulnerable “checkpoints” on the court before turning up the heat.
&gt; 
&gt; This system, combined with the Sonics’ athleticism and quick-strike ability, helped them overcome their lack of size and probably should have yielded a title. It looked bad when teams managed to beat it, but those moments were more than cancelled out by turnovers, rushed shots, and the general discomfort opponents felt trying to navigate what seemed like an endless supply of bodies in the way.

Thanks to the new format, the ASG has become what it was always meant to be, The NBA’s rendition of Avengers Endgame with all of your favorite players battling it out in an epic crossover episode. In terms of intensity and pure talent on the floor, this game could probably rival the legendary Dream Team scrimmage. Heres some things I liked and some things I didn’t like.

Things I Liked

Giannis, Gobert, and Lowry are solely responsible for turning this game to 11. After getting creamed in the first quarter, Giannis took it on himself to ramp up the intensity and “try hard”. He was really gunning to be the first Kobe Bryant MVP. This along with with Gobert’s emphatic Fuck Them Kids TM dunks in the third quarter to take the lead (along with $100k from a group of needy kids watching 20 feet away from him) and Lowry’s never before seen in an ASG flopping and drawing charges, really elevated the competitiveness of the ASG, hopefully setting the expectations for years to come. Side note ( Gobert is actually a very good Allstar and this makes me even more upset that he was snubbed last year.)

The individual rivalries on each team. Lebron and Giannis looked like arch enemies in this game. Another scene I enjoyed was watching Pascal Siakam walk back to his bench with a shit-eating grin after beating Kawhi Leonard 1v1. Also with the building tension in Philly, Ben Simmons snatching Embiid’s pass out of midair mad me feel some type of way. Side note ( I really think Simmon’s could be the first”guard” to win DPOY since Gary Payton.) https://streamable.com/883zg

Team Lebron’s bench lineup. This lineup had three of the leagues all time best passers in CP3, Westbrook, and Jokic, with Simmons and Tatum to boot. Watching this lineup run in transition and make extra passes was some of the prettiest basketball I’ve seen this year. https://streamable.com/ei0we https://streamable.com/gkww9

Common and Chance The Rappers performances were surprisingly good, save Hot Shower. Hopefully this can be a benchmark of where Chance turned his career back around.

Things I Didn’t Like


I didn’t think that there would be another national anthem as bad as Fergie’s so soon.

James Harden’s performance was shocking. As one of Harden’s biggest defenders he played far too many minutes last night. This game was a nasty combination of his apathy for the ASG and his tendency to fall apart in big games. The worst play being him passing up an open layup to ice the game in favor of a corner three. Moreyball has corrupted this man to his core.

Kawhi’s very Kawhi like MVP speech. Being the first recipient of the Kobe Bryant MVP award I was expecting a bit more that the usual Kawhi “We just went out there and scored more points than the other team” response.

Having Marv Albert and Reggie Miller announce this game. In one of the clips above, Marv mistakes Tatum for Jokic, and I’m almost certain I heard him call Lillard with the fadeaway on one of “Kevin Lowry’s” shots. While Reggie doesn’t make such senile mistakes, He’s just not a good announcer. Also, notice how I didn’t even mention Grant Hill.

Having the game finish on a free throw was very anti-climatic. Hopefully next year teams will have to win by two so this is less likely to happen.

And lastly, I miss Steph, Klay, KD, and Kyrie. This game would have been on another level with those guys in crunch time instead of the likes of Kemba Walker and Siakam.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,78666,public,self,My ASG Recap,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/f5h1ns/my_asg_recap/,,,,,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'qBB1LO1BbeXnehZnaNzPNlWoRSEfY--1GE6ZBrEH6kU', 'resolutions': [{'height': 60, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/iW5eOU5R4yiBpGvXVzTLYX8Xao2ZtSHtlu2Sky9ICG8.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b49e4899cb0171fd5c5bc19cb6312bf843af303', 'width': 108}, {'height': 121, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/iW5eOU5R4yiBpGvXVzTLYX8Xao2ZtSHtlu2Sky9ICG8.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05143a274f30e15c67a9c7468393f6deca395d11', 'width': 216}, {'height': 180, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/iW5eOU5R4yiBpGvXVzTLYX8Xao2ZtSHtlu2Sky9ICG8.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=328fd748eb8c87510c6796c4d5e24864706868b5', 'width': 320}, {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/iW5eOU5R4yiBpGvXVzTLYX8Xao2ZtSHtlu2Sky9ICG8.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6967e39a766e1fbf00c7d4a87175225d5f8b98e2', 'width': 640}, {'height': 540, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/iW5eOU5R4yiBpGvXVzTLYX8Xao2ZtSHtlu2Sky9ICG8.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5870646a31818f810d8b3ee0b8c319ae12784224', 'width': 960}, {'height': 607, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/iW5eOU5R4yiBpGvXVzTLYX8Xao2ZtSHtlu2Sky9ICG8.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9e5ed0b0d8e16f2e2dbc7cd23c8fd6f4add1997', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 720, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/iW5eOU5R4yiBpGvXVzTLYX8Xao2ZtSHtlu2Sky9ICG8.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=729b815db3fb98e0886f0143c88d81e51f946f1f', 'width': 1280}, 'variants': {}}]}",,

I don't know who the fuck these players pissed off. 

Just taking Kyrie as an example– he has this reputation as a terrible teammate, locker room cancer, etc. But literally none of his teammates have come out and said anything like that. Not Marcus Smart, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson, KD, or anybody. They all defended him, actually. But shows like First Take or those shitty podcasts love to constantly make videos with titles like “Kyrie’s mood swings make people queasy???” And those fucking comment sections…it’s literally a breeding ground for people who hate a certain player to validate themselves based off of half-truths. Kyrie obviously played like shit last year in the playoffs but I find it remarkable how that disaster of a season ended with everybody, and I mean everybody walking away scot-free except for him. It’s reasonable that he gets blame as the star player and he clearly vastly underperformed, but damn…one guy can’t mess up a team like that. It’s not that deep. They just didn’t fit together as a team. 

Anyways my point is, the media can simply create a singular narrative and people will believe it. Or  haters will feel like they’re being validated. And I find it incredibly unfair to the players themselves. What have Kyrie, or Jimmy Butler, or KD, or Westbrook really done?

I would personally rank them:

1. F. VanVleet- The best three point shooter of the group. Is a slight positive on defense. Has strong efficiency and advanced stats. Has shown he can be an excellent supporting piece on a championship level team.

2. E. Bledsoe- The best defensive player of the four. Has the best advanced stats. Gets knocked down a slot because he is a below average three point shooter. I believe his statistical profile as a whole is slightly inflated playing with Giannis.

3. S. Dinwiddie- Has the most ppg, highest usage rate, and gets to the line far more than the other three. He is also the worst defensive player and least efficient. Not shooting the three well. Have yet to see how he performs as the third or fourth option on a championship level squad.

4. M. Brogdon- His three point shooting and defensive stats were worse than I anticipated. Has the worst advanced stats of the group. Hasn't shot the three like VanVleet, worse defensive player than Bledsoe, dosnt get to the line like Dinwiddie.

That said, there's obviously a lot of interest in the idea, and I think most would agree that if the  NBA created the event and made it fair, competitive, and fun for the players, it would become one of the most hyped events of the entire weekend.

The issues people seem to bring up a lot are:

1. How to prevent players from being scrutinized by fans for losing, which would discourage participation
2. How to make it competitive.

I think a pure 1-on-1 tournament format would make issue #1 unavoidable, which is why something similar to the Boston drill would be better.

the pool of players rotate playing 1 on 1 with 5-8 seconds per possession. If the player on offense scores, they get a point and the defender goes off. If they don't score, the defender gets the ball and tries to score on the next player. First to 5 points wins.

This would make fans less likely to draw hard comparisons between players, which seems to be the main problem people have with a 1v1 tourney. You could also have separate competitions for bigs and smalls and maybe add some fun rules, like the defender getting to pick where on the court they start the possession(3 pt line, baseline, top of the key, etc.).


To address the competitiveness, my idea is as follows: 

Replace the dunk contest with the Boston Drill tournament as the marquee Saturday Night event (dunk contest still happens but earlier). Only non-all-stars can enter, and the winning big and small are given an all-star spot. Then there will be less big name players who would get scrutinized the most for losing, and the prize would be good enough to make the event competitive. On top of that, players who feel they got snubbed for the ASG can get a chance to prove they belong there.

I'd love to hear what people think. Would it work? How can it be improved? Would fans watch?

Some further concepts to think about:

* Only players from teams without an all-star can enter
* Players can decide whether they want to compete as a big or a small
* Have a cash buy-in like in previous suggestions
* Fan-vote for tournament entries

One dunk gets a 50. Then the next dunk is better, and also gets a 50. Now we don't know WHICH one is better. These judges pigeon hole themselves.

- The system should be 1 -- 50, with halves (0.5), and judges need to use the whole damn system. Give people 30s. 38s. 46s. I would even argue NO ONE should get a 50. Because if the next guy does a better dunk, you cannot rate it higher than the last dunk.

- Alternatively, they could put the dunks in order of which ones were the best, and we play golf score. 1 point for best dunk. 2 Points for second best dunk, etc. Lowest score wins.

- NO MORE CELEBRITY JUDGES. I'm tired of this shit. They don't take it seriously, and these contestants do. The judges should be past dunk winners, perhaps the last five winners, or taken from a pool of retired dunk contest winners. 

- Ban Wade's ass from being a judge. He goes: ""I got peer pressured into making that score. That was a 9."" Wade gave a 10.

Side Note: I appreciate Kenny being real on the commentary, saying things were an 8 when all the judges gave a perfect score. Saying Gordon got robbed. So damn stupid.

Involve a 3rd team to make the cash work, if necessary. He doesn't have a no-trade clause in his deal and his 15% trade kicker would not apply, if i'm not mistaken.

***

At a time when it seems like [every team plays the same way](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/f1qs6t/oc_the_unbearable_sameness_of_moreyball_25_most/), it can be illuminating to see what makes them different. 

[In this chart](https://imgur.com/y8pxB59), I show how often each team shoots from the different parts of the court, relative to league average. Darker areas on the court indicate a higher amount of volume from the corresponding area compared to the rest of the league. 

For example, take a look at the patch of dark red +30 feet from the hoop on the Atlanta Hawks chart. That means the Hawks (read: Trae Young) take more shots from that part of the court than any other team. 

Meanwhile, the Spurs have a blanket of black in the mid-range. Accordingly, they take more mid-range shots per game than anyone else (the next closest is Indiana).  

Note that blank areas show where a team shoots at or below league average volume. For example, the Houston Rockets and Brooklyn Nets have almost no color in the mid-range because they take at or less than the league average number of attempts from that part of the court. A team like the Celtics takes roughly a league average number of attempts from almost all parts of the court, which is why their whole chart is mostly blank. 

*** 

**Methodology:**

I charted every shot taken this season and binned them into similarly sized hexagons. I then found out the league average number of attempts from each hexagon and calculated how many standard deviations away from the mean each team was from each hexagon. The darker the color on the chart, the higher the deviation. A team taking a league-average number of attempts from each location would have a blank chart.

The information in these power rankings will take into account all aspects and angles of what makes a team elite, mediocre or outright tank artists. As I go along with my idea of providing an accurate and realistic power index of all 30 teams on a weekly basis, I hope to also engage in some sharp-minded banter with whoever will make this list all the more credible. Welcome to the first batch of the precise NBA power rankings.

&amp;#x200B;

As we approach the All Star break of the 2019-20 season, let's take a look at the first half (2/3 actually but who's counting) of the NBA season and see where your favorite team ranks.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Milwaukee Bucks - Top record in the league|Pure Dominance of the Eastern Conference|Not much else to say.
2. Los Angeles Clippers - Lakers fans will hate seeing this but 2-0 against the main competition in the west puts them ahead of the Lakeshow by default. 
3. Los Angeles Lakers - Good at beating bad teams|Struggles against playoff-bound teams are something to worry about.
4. Denver Nuggets - Top to bottom, Denver might be the most talented team in the Association|With Paul Millsap back, he along with Jerami Grant will provide tough defense to any wing-heavy team (i.e. Clippers, Lakers)
5. Toronto Raptors - 15 in a row means something, no matter what. With Siakam back in full effect, Toronto will provide great competition in a top heavy eastern conference.
6. Miami Heat - Although I believe they overpaid for an overly hyped player in Andre Igoudala, they should be able to 
7. Boston Celtics - It seems like this Celtics squad has been teetering on the fence of greatness for a few years now, yet their overall growth seems to have plateaued. Their core group of young guys along with Kemba Walker could possibly be in line for a surge in the 2nd half but with no major moves at the deadline, we shouldn't expect anything more than 3rd in the east.
8. Philadelphia 76ers - With the locker room drama becoming more apparent, the Sixers are in the same boat as the Celtics in terms of what to expect. Philly also made no moves at the trade deadline, which means the poor 3 point shooting will continue to be their Achilles heal.
9. Utah Jazz - Utah cracks the top 10 and could possibly be a dark horse come playoff time. With Mike Conley back from injury, the Jazz could peak at just the right time and if they crack the top 4 in the West, they will be a problem at home as they currently rock a 20-5 home record.
10. Houston Rockets - The Russell Westbrook/James Harden experiment has be a roller coaster ride, but ultimately this small ball team will more than likely not be able to sustain being a lackluster rebounding teams come playoff time.

People immediately reacted to that remark, as if it was entirely outlandish. Obviously it depends on the years, but I think 5 years/100 would be a steal for FVV. I think 4 years/100 would be fair.  I'm genuinely curious what the knock against him is? because apparently people think DAngelo Russell is clearly much better than him, or that Jamal Murray is TWICE as valuable?

**Contract year comparisons** *(per 36)***:**

**Eric Bledsoe** *(19.7 Pts, 6.8 Ast, 2.6 Tov... 23% Usg, 58% TS, 27% Ast, 3.5 BPM )*  

**Contract**: 4 yrs/ 70, AAV = 17.5

This was seen as a very team friendly deal- which it is. The open market would have been kinder to Bled, but obviously he prioritized winning. This contract was obviously agreed upon the idea that he'd be nothing more than the third option offensively. And for a guy that is not expected to improve on that end at age 29, the most important aspect for Milwaukee paying him is his premier perimeter defense.

**Terry Rozier** *(14.2 Pts, 4.6 Ast, 1.4 Tov.... 19% Usg, 50% TS, 18% Ast, -0.7 BPM )*

**Contract**: 4 yrs/ 70, AAV = 17.5

This contract is a reflection of the weight that playoff performances hold. Terry was in many ways awful last year, but the franchise point guard talk was settled after he showed he can lead a team in the 2018 playoffs. He's an average-at-best defender, not an efficient scorer, and very clearly an inconsistent performer. He is the same age as FVV. Charlotte likely was ok with overpaying, understandably so, because they are looking to raise their floor (which Kemba's absence brought below-ground) rather than their ceiling.

**D'Angelo Russell** *(25.2 Pts, 8.3 Ast, 3.7 Tov... 32% Usg, 53% TS, 41% Ast, 3.4 BPM)*

**Contract**: 4 yrs/ 117, AAV = 29.25

Obviously Dlo is gifted offensively, but I have a hard time understanding this contract. He is such a bad defender that you \*could\* question whether he is a winning player. Yes, what happened in Brooklyn last year was great, but that was in a far weaker Eastern Conference. And he got put in his place in the playoffs. He produced big numbers out of necessity- and his absence has been filled by higher usage for Dinwiddie....who is producing at the same exact level for a third of the cost. If the idea that he is a second tier Harden/Curry instant unguardable offense, then this contract makes sense ONLY for a team like Minnesota looking to expedite a rebuild. It is not just a cliche that defense wins championships.

**Jamal Murray** *(20.1 Pts, 5.3 Ast, 2.3 Tov.... 22% Usg, 54% TS,  22% Ast, 0.1 BPM)*

**Contract**: 5 yrs/ 170, AAV = 34

This situation is the opposite of the Bledsoe contract. Not team friendly, but paying for the continuation of what they are building with him and Jokic. All we really know about Jamal is that when he is on, he can pretty much go at his own pace and as a compliment to Jokic, becomes pretty unguardable. He is not the most consistent, he is far from proven as a distributor (which he doesn't need to be in that system), and definitely a defensive liability. This contract makes sense on the fact that A) he has plenty of room to grow, and B) he is a proven big-time shot maker. Otherwise, I'm sure there are plenty of teams that would balk at the idea of paying him over $25 mil AAV. 

The same un-answerable question can be raised for him and DLo: would Toronto have won with them instead of Fred? FVV was a total negatively offensively for over half the playoffs. But when Golden State was on the verge of stealing momentum, they turned to FVV- to GUARD Steph Curry in a freakin box-and-1. It was that defense which took back the momentum. There are a handful players who you can hope will score 20, but there is next to no one that you can put the weight of guarding Steph on like that- for 40 minutes, while remaining an effective (and in Fred's case last June, lethal) floor general/shooter.

**Fred VanVleet** *(17.9 Pts, 6.9 Ast, 2.3 Tov..... 22% USG, 55% TS, 28% Ast, 2.2 BPM)*

**Contract**: ?? 

Basically everything good that was said about the above players can be combined into one. On a scale of Russell to Bledsoe, he is right there at the top of defensive PGs. He is up to the challenge of guarding an All Star for 30+ minutes. Like Terry Rozier, his playoff performance cannot be forgotten, and had he not even played this season, being the 4th best player on a championship team is what teams first think when evaluating him. But he even leveled up this year, and like D'Angelo, has shown he is capable of holding it down as a focal point on a really good team. Like Murray, he's shown he is a big time shot maker, does not fear the big moment, and as good as it gets in late shot clock situations. With all the responsibility he has, he's still the most efficient 3PT shooter of this group, and has the best assist-to-turnover. He has a great assist rate- while playing mostly OFF ball. And its no coincidence that the only guys who play more minutes than him are Hall of Famers (Harden, Dame, Lowry). So what am I missing, why should I believe that he's not a 100 million dollar man?

Teams that could greatly benefit from a young franchise point guard: Detroit, San Antonio, New York, Chicago, Phoenix...Toronto. Those rebuilding teams are in the situation like Charlotte/Minnesota where there is really no detriment to overpaying for your PG. What exactly is it that those teams should be saving their money for...the Anthony Davis or Giannis sweepstakes? nope (although I am here for Freak and Pop). Evan Fournier? I'm rockin with steady Freddy...

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; People seem to think Fred VanVleet won't be \*that\* hot of a commodity and I don't understand where this is coming from. He has overperformed and blown past expectations quite literally every single year, and is still not in his prime.

* Russell was 21-0 in winner-take-all games in his NBA career. No one else was close to that mark. If the Celtics &amp; an opponent were even throughout a series &amp; Bill Russell was playing, Boston was ALWAYS going to pull it out in the end. 

* The Celtics were ho-hum right before Russell joined the team, terrible right after he left, and equally terrible when he was on the team but missed games (*which wasn’t often*), but when he was there they were the most dominant title-winning team in sports history which proves how ludicrous the “He was simply the best player on a loaded team” comment is. When he missed games during his career, the Celtics had a losing record (*10-18, and 18 of those 28 missed games were against teams with losing records*). When Russell missed 3 or more games in a row --so his teammates really had to adjust &amp; couldn’t just “get up” for one game without their leader-- the Celtics were 1-12. They were horrible without him. There is *NO* evidence the Celtics were any good when Russell wasn’t on the floor, rather a ton of evidence to the contrary. 

* Similarly, the Celtics didn’t win the title only 2 times during Russell’s 13-year career, and both were (probably) due to difficulties experienced by Russell. In 1958, the Hawks topped Boston 4-2 in the Finals (*winning by 2, 3, 2, &amp; 1 points*), during which Russell missed 2 games &amp; played hurt when he was available in the series. It’s safe to say Boston would have won that title with a healthy Russell. In 1967, the aging Celtics, fresh off of 8 straight championships, lost to the loaded &amp; younger Sixers in the ECF. This was the first year Russell was Boston’s player-coach, which is significant since he faced horrendously stressful &amp; over-the-top racism as the first black coach in US pro sports history, and he played so much &amp; so intensely he often forgot to sub players which hurt his team. The next season, the Celtics were older &amp; considered “done”, but he added a bench coach to handle subs, and they topped the defending &amp; favored champion Sixers in the playoffs, and then won the title. Then the “seriously, they’re done now” 1968-69 Celtics clawed their way into the Finals &amp; beat the LOADED Lakers 4-3 in Russell’s final season. Two giant asterisks have to go on the only two championships Boston *didn’t* win during Russell’s career. 

* Russell’s list of clutch games, series, and moments is ridiculous, but I’ll only point out he had [the greatest Game 7 performance of all-time in the 1962 Finals](https://old.reddit.com/r/VintageNBA/comments/bei34r/on_this_date_april_18_1962_bill_russell_had_the/), scoring 30 points &amp; grabbing 40 rebounds to win the title in a super-tight Game 7. 

* Part of what made Russell so unbelievable in big games &amp; moments (especially late in the games), was that his IQ and level of manipulating opponents is unparalleled historically. On defense, he’d often intentionally “just miss” blocking a particular star player’s shots earlier in a contest, but late in the game when the opponent was lulled into thinking they could get a certain shot off over Russell that night, he’d extend the extra inch and come up with clutch blocks &amp; defensive plays they weren't expecting. I’ve never heard of another player doing stuff like this. Add in his truly Olympic-level athleticism (*[7th ranked high jumper in the world in 1956](https://trackandfieldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/14-mHJRank.pdf)*), and his defense was a cross between Tim Duncan &amp; Kevin Garnett -- covering everything everywhere with incredible explosiveness, plus impeccable timing &amp; decision-making.

* There is no hyperbole in saying Russell was *unquestionably* the most impactful defensive player ever. I feel like I’d be insulting the intelligence of knowledgeable fans by explaining this any further. 

* Russell is one of very few superstars who had an overwhelming positive &amp; unifying force on his team in a way that had significant on-the-court value far beyond normal quantifiable skills/stats (*i.e. dictating the culture &amp; how it affected the team’s play, creating the ultimate synergy*). In that category I put Bill Russell, Jerry West, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson (*from ‘86-91*), Tim Duncan, Steve Nash, and Stephen Curry. Lots of other star players had an impact on winning and were good leaders, but often didn’t have that contagious alpha-but-not-asshole power to keep everything in one positive direction (*ex: Dr. J and David Robinson*).

* The stories about his IQ are legendary &amp; numerous - [here are some clips about his hoops IQ](https://old.reddit.com/r/VintageNBA/comments/e5pplu/imo_bill_russell_had_one_of_the_highest_bbiqs_ever/). At least watch the 3rd one on that list (""Some more mindgames"") to see a short interview with him talking about manipulation of a star opponent in a way I’ve never heard another player articulate; he truly was thinking on a whole different level to create advantages for his team. 

* Bill Russell was so versatile on the floor, he would train &amp; [play all 5 positions on offense](https://old.reddit.com/r/VintageNBA/comments/bozife/bill_russell_ran_all_5_positions_on_offense_for/). The only other players in history who could *maybe* do this are Maurice Stokes &amp; Giannis Antetokounmpo, but Russell’s results were quite different, plus immediate &amp; sustained. His value to the Celtics’ offense is WAY underrated, especially [on the fast break](https://old.reddit.com/r/VintageNBA/comments/bfh9f2/bill_russell_leading_finishing_fast_breaks_are/) where he had a bigger influence than Steve Nash due to how well he could start, run, and finish it. 

* Speaking of which, Bill Russell was an *elite* passer, both in the half-court &amp; full-court, and put up [insane passing numbers for a center, especially in the playoffs](https://old.reddit.com/r/VintageNBA/comments/bx42hh/big_men_c_or_pf_who_were_great_passers_so_much_so/). John Havlicek talked about how much worse the Celtics’ offense was right after Russell’s retirement due to his missing passing.

* Russell lead an *unranked* San Francisco University team to 2 consecutive NCAA titles, and [could have won a title all 3 seasons he played at SFU](https://old.reddit.com/r/VintageNBA/comments/dddwse/bill_russell_won_2_titles_in_college_but_actually/) if not for an injury to his HOF PG teammate, KC Jones. Even at the college level, he could lead players who weren’t supposed to win to the ultimate heights; it wasn’t just in Boston. And he was the leading scorer, rebounder, &amp; defender on the 1956 gold medal winning Olympic team, which had an average margin of victory of +53, the highest ever (*’92 Dream Team was +44*). 

* Fans often knock him for not being a high scorer. He played on a team that spread around the scoring so very few Celtics ever had big scoring numbers, and he often had the best FG% on the team, with a career FG% that was higher than the league’s by the same ratio as Hakeem over the NBA’s during his career. Russell understood what sacrifices to make so the Celtics would be winners, which is why he won the 1962 MVP ([voting](https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_1962.html)) over Wilt Chamberlain (*his epic 50 ppg &amp; 26 rpg season*) and Oscar Robertson (*his epic triple-double season*). **It was clear that Russell’s approach was far more valuable to his team’s success than that of other superstars with monster stats.**",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,78181,public,self,"Happy 86th birthday, Bill Russell!

He is a center that anchors the paint and disturbs opposing players who are trying to drive to the hoop. Unlike Rudy Gobert, Lopez does not switch so much during the picks, but stays closer to the basket and doubles up as soon as the opposing player approaches the paint. In the [first chart](https://i.imgur.com/LeGmS4L.png), Block Chart as I will call it, you see all the blocks of Brook Lopez this season. The graph actually turned out to be less sexy than I expected.

The Bucks are interesting because they allow the most threes per game for opposing teams, and they have by far the best defense, at a time when everything revolves around the three pointer. However, this is possible because of the amazing system, with the brothers Lopez and Giannis and other tall wings and guards, they are able to very effectively cover anyone attacking the Paint. From the [Restricted Area the Bucks only allow 49.9% of the shots](https://i.imgur.com/FJynEAR.png)!!!!! The difference between them and the second-ranked Toronto Raptors at 57.8% is bigger than the difference between Toronto and the Cleveland Cavs, last team by that metric, which allows 65.2%.

And now one has to wonder why is Brook so important in all of this? So even though the entire Bucks' team is very good defensively, as you can see [here](https://i.imgur.com/mCfkW62.png) they all have good defensive percentages, Brook not only defends the most shots, almost 7 more than Giannis, but also defends those shots very effectively at 40.9%

In addition, Lopez is the player who [contests the most shots in the entire NBA](https://i.imgur.com/VjbE96J.png). He constests almost 20 shots per game, which is impressive. What is even more impressive is that he boxes out 4 times per game. This may seem like a very low figure at first glance, but the Bucks are at the top of the league in that aspect and everyone is involved in boxing out, and given that he contests shots so much, it is really good number. Anyhow, everyone is probably already in paint so a rebound is inevitable.

And lastly, Brook is 6th in the league in Defensive Win Share (DWS). Although Giannis leads the entire league in that statistic and the impact of Brook on the entire squad is not as significant as Gobert's impact on the rest of the Jazz team, this is sufficient confirmation that Brook Lopez is a key Milwaukee Bucks defender.

Dame joined company of Ralph Sampson, David Robinson and Blake Griffin as he was the freshman who impressed voters the most in the 2012-13 season.

Lillard, in his inauguration as the Blazers’ point guard, averaged a cool stat line of 19/3.1/6.5 wuth complimentary shooting splits of .43/.37/.84. Through his rookie year, Dame was consistency personified as he and Kyle Singler were the only rookies to feature in every game.

However it must be noted that the ex- Weber State point guard wasn’t the general consensus pick for the award.

In New Orleans, the Hornets had just jumped the lottery to fleece the Cavaliers, Wizards and legendary 7-win Charlotte Bobcats from the premier pick in the 2012 draft, and in doing so were able to select the most highly coveted draft prospect since LeBron James was sent to Cleveland in 2003. With the first pick in the draft, New Orleans selected the 19-year old power forward Anthony Davis from Kentucky. 

Davis was raw but impressive in his first year in New Orleans, averaging 13/8/5 on a minutes restriction after having slight injury trouble through his rookie campaign.

Here’s where things get interesting. 

The 2020 ROTY “race” is again, and award almost set in stone. 

Ja Morant’s scintillating season as the point guard for the Memphis Grizzlies has been nothing short of breathtaking. As I’m writing this, Morant is leading the Grizz’ to a record on the right side of the .500 line, as the defiant Tennessee basketball club continue to defy expectations and continue on their warpath of the Western Conference, having beaten contenders Denver, Houston and LAC by a margin of 34 in the month of January alone. 

Leading the upstart Grizzlies, Ja is averaging 17.6/3.5/7.0 on shooting splits of 50/38/78, not to dissimilar to Dame’s rookie numbers. Ja is battling post subject Damian Lillard’s Blazers and co-Rookie Zion Williamson’s Pelicans for the 8th seed and what’s looking like a shot against, you guessed it, AD in the first round of the 2020 playoffs.

Last year, New Orleans once again jumped the lottery with this time the 7th worst overall record landing them the prized pick at the Barclays Center, once again leapfrogging the Cavs and Wizards in the process (sorry guys). With the first pick in the draft, New Orleans once again managed to select the most coveted draft prospect since LeBron James, as 19-year old power forward Zion Williamson became the newest star four at the Pels’ disposal.

Zion, akin to AD. has stuggled with injury through his rookie season, but has shone when asked, and is averaging an astounding 21/7/2 on a minutes restriction, with performances which have shown his scary potential in the future of the league. 

Grizzly fans and Pelicans fans should no doubt feel a tingle of excitement whilst reading this post, as following in these two players’ trajectories will almost certainly lead to a fruitful future for their respective teams and countless moments of brilliance from their star-men, unless the Pelicans fail to fly high with their second generational big-man talent, as their name might suggest.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,78165,public,self,Ja and Zion’s rookie campaign draw some interesting parallels to a previous season this decade.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/f2vhuj/ja_and_zions_rookie_campaign_draw_some/,,,148fa422-421d-11e9-8f9d-0e3c3d0fbb30,High Quality,,,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

I think its taken for granted that NBA superstars are more valuable than the very best qbs. And in a sense, its easy to see why on the surface. N BA superstars are 1 of 5 players and they play both  sides of the ball. 

But consider an alternative take:

How big a gap is there between a typical nba superstar and lets say an all star. Think about the gap between say James Harden and Ben Simmons. Or Damian Lillard vs Donovan Mitchell. 

Now think about the elite qbs like Mahomes or Vintage Rodgers over a pro bowler like Dak Prescott or Matt Ryan.

One might say the gap's in both cases are about the same. And maybe they are.

But the big missed point is not the average size of the gap, but how volatile that gap is over time. The gap between Harden and Simmons stays relatively constant over seasons. The gap between Mahomes or Ryan fluctuates hugely over seasons. Think about the difference between vintage Peyton vs Romo. Some years Romo cycled up and sometimes he was down, but Manning was always great and sometimes he had legendary seasons. He never would have a poor season or even a mediocre one. Romo could.  

The gap was always varying, sometimes ballooning in a way that Harden and Simmons rarely does. 

In that sense, I would argue the elite qb is more valuable because he guarantees consistency over a very long period of time while the non-elite qbs cannot guarantee such consistency.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,78165,public,self,Contrarian take: Elite QBs are more valuable than a typical NBA Superstar,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/f2uxp3/contrarian_take_elite_qbs_are_more_valuable_than/,,,,,,,,,,,

1. He moves before the defender realizes. [Here](https://youtu.be/T2uJwx2KCwo?t=125), Whiteside is waiting for Zion to catch, set and then move. But Zion begins his move before he catches and gets around Whiteside before he realizes. This leads to a foul. ^(A foul is a bucket)   
Hakeem explains [here](https://youtu.be/dkxFtT0GUP0?t=70) how to use this move effectively and I loved how Zion executed it today.
2. His low-sweep, fake combination to get into the paint was elite. [Here](https://youtu.be/T2uJwx2KCwo?t=113), Ariza knows that Zion is lethal in the pain if he gets a free left-handed layup so he tries to block that path.  Zion catches the ball, does a low swipe, one bounce and he's in the paint. The fake sells the defender because that's his strongest area but the smoothness of the move sends him unguarded into the paint where he elevated and destroyed the rim.   
Once again, what better way to learn than to look at one of the best post players of all time. [Hakeem did the same thing](https://youtu.be/22O2lApCBBs?t=88) but to the opposite side. Hakeem's favorite side was the right so he sweeps, fakes, and gets into the paint from the left.

Overall, I think he can get plenty of buckets just due to his athleticism, but I feel that this knowledge of the game and ability to execute is what will set him apart in the years to come.

I see this as extremely valuable because they resist giving up the most efficient shots (FTs) and typically encourage a contested shot from floater range, while also keeping key players out of foul trouble.

Compare this to a couple of their perimeter guys, like Connaughton and DiVincenzo, who are prone to jumping on any pump fake. They are fairly good in these instances at flying by with side- or rear-contests that keep them from fouling but completely open up the defense for drive-and-kick opportunities. They seem to have this freedom to create chaos given to them by the coaches, but it can cause real vulnerabilities.

I tried to come up with two rosters that are about equal in talent but would naturally play very different styles of basketball.  Team A, I wanted to put together as many players that play very unique styles of basketball compared to their peers.  With Team B, I wanted to have mostly players that were an accurate representation of what a typical point guard, center etc.. looks like in the NBA.  Also I was really close to giving Team B Lillard and Eric Gordon instead of CP3 and Klay.  So if that makes a difference in your answer, please let me know.

We are 50ish games into the season, over 50 games, 800 pts and 400 ast break down to 16 ppg, 8 apg. I feel like this is a good barometer to discover some of the leagues high impact playmakers so far this season.

*table sorted by TS%*

Player | TS% | PTS | AST
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
Damian Lillard | 62.5% | 1,554 | 413
Ben Simmons | 60.8% | 871 | 431
Trae Young | 59.9% | 1,456 | 447
Lebron James| 57.1% | 1,242 | 537
Devonte' Graham | 53.4% | 951 | 412


Some interesting discoveries, in my opinion, is how wildly efficient Trae Young and Damian Lillard have been this year. Lillard has the highest point total of the five players and posts the highest TS% at 62.5%. The difference between he and Trae ultimately is the winning. I think it's fair to chalk that up to roster construction, the Hawks just aren't there quite yet. Trae, the second highest in point total is at 59.9%. When you factor in the difficulty in the shots they take, both well known for the logo shots, their efficiency is marvelous in that context.

Graham is struggling as far as efficiency is concerned, but you would be a fool to say he hasn't been a bright spot for Charlotte this season after losing Kemba, probably the franchise's greatest player. 61.7% of Graham's shots come from the three point line and his three point percentage in January (34.3%) and February (30.4) so far has affected his efficiency.

Ben's efficiency has been great, but I think the least surprising of the group. It's very well known a high volume of his shots come at the rim (63.2% of shots come at rim, makes 72.5%) and for a good reason. With his free throw percentage climbing, 67.4% from the line in January on 6.8 FTA, 67.6% from the line in February with 7.4 FTA.

LeBron's TS% is the lowest it has been since his return to Cleveland in 14-15 (57.7%), but is at a career high in AST% at 49.7%. Now that LeBron has arguably his best teammate in AD, or maybe the most tailor-fit teammate for LeBron, he has capitalized. LeBron is head and shoulders above the rest when looking at his assist total which is 537. Second closest is Trae Young at 447. The difference between 1st and 2nd is similar to the difference between 2nd and 9th (Harden; 367) or 10th (CP3; 342). With that total, LeBron is the only player in the league averaging a PTS/AST double-double, with 24.8/**10.7**.

These 5 are the only in the league with 400 assists or more. When you drop it to 800 PTS/300 AST, the following appear:

**Player (AST):**

Nikola Jokic (374)

Luka Doncic (373)

James Harden (367)

Chris Paul (342)

Back in the Heatles days we saw the start of resting players as a bit of gamesmanship.

But it was probably the one time where the gamesmanship was on full display. Another thing that comes to mind is the time a LeBron-led team lost the season series to someone and then beat them in the playoffs.

This would shore up the Trailblazers need for a Center as Whiteside’s contract will be up, and it is unsure whether or not Nurkic will be effective after his gruesome leg injury. 

On the Sixers side, it would open up the floor for them almost instantly. Their lineup would be an easy adjustment with Horford playing his natural 5 position.

These teams are soley based on this season so far. As long as you have played at least 30 or 35 games you qualify.  Beyond that minimum I only consider games or minutes played as a tie breaker. I was a little loose with positions, but I believe all players can reasonably play the position I slotted them.


1st Team

G L. Doncic

G J. Harden

F K. Leonard

F L. James

C G. Antetokounmpo

I really wanted to put Lillard on this team in light of his recent dominance, but Harden still has better advanced stats and does more for a better team.


2nd Team

G D. Lillard

G J. Butler

F P. George

F A. Davis

C N. Jokic

George has just barley enough games for me not to knock him out of consideration. I think he is clearly a better player than any other forwards not named LeBron, Kawhi, Anthony Davis or Giannis.


3rd Team

G K. Walker

G T. Young

F J. Tatum

F P. Siakam

C R. Gobert

Booker, Ingram, Middleton, and Embiid were my toughest omissions. Walker, Tatum, Gobert, and Siakam are all either the best or 1B player on a strong playoff team.

[Today, the list of 44 finalists was released.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/f1sbug/stein_stephen_curry_anthony_davis_kevin_durant/fh84yzw/) Who do you think will make the final roster, or at least be in contention? Here's how I would categorize each player's chances:

**Locks (assuming health) (4): LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Steph Curry**
These four, to me, are complete locks when healthy. Paul George will be on the roster if he’s healthy after sacrificing his body in 2016. LeBron, AD and Steph are obvious choices. LeBron hasn’t committed to the Olympics yet, so there’s a chance he doesn’t participate.

**Major health questions (4): Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Kawhi Leonard, Klay Thompson**
These guys would probably be locks when healthy, but we're too far away from the Olympics to know if they'll be available. My guess is that none of them play, but we'll see.

**Fringe players who participated in FIBA (7): Kemba Walker, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner**
These guys probably wouldn’t make the roster if it wasn’t for the FIBA fiasco. But after putting their reputations on the line for Team USA, one or two will probably get rewarded for their participation.

**Possible Popovich favoritism (3): DeMar DeRozan, LaMarcus Aldridge, Derrick White**
None of these guys should make the team, but one of them might.

**The rest of the pool (10): Bam Adebayo, Malcolm Brogdon, Jimmy Butler, Draymond Green, James Harden, Brandon Ingram, Damian Lillard, Kyle Lowry, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook**


*Players who probably won't make it...*

**Fringe players that dropped out of the FIBA Worlds (6): Andre Drummond, Montrezl Harrell, Tobias Harris, Kevin Love, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker**
Jerry Colangelo has said that Team USA will remember which players dropped out of FIBA Worlds. Any fringe players who dropped out can say goodbye to this team. Meanwhile, guys like Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard and James Harden will probably be forgiven for not participating.

**Probably not good enough (10): Harrison Barnes, Mike Conley, Joe Harris, Gordon Hayward, Dwight Howard, Kyle Kuzma, JaVale McGee, Mason Plumlee, Marcus Smart, Victor Oladipo**",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,77945,public,self,"What are your predictions for the final US Olympic roster, and why?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/f1xndi/what_are_your_predictions_for_the_final_us/,,,,,,,,,,1581371968.0,

Personaly I´m not quite at the point, but I know where those people are coming from. At the same time there is a trend to draw fouls on these shots and I had an idea to counter those trends:

\- Decrease the amount of free throws for a foul on a three point shooter from three to two.

I think the statistics back me up here. The following numbers are median numbers from all the NBA teams and aren´t exact to the last digit, but they are close enough to reality.

NBA teams score 1.04 Points per Possession(PPP) on twos and 1.05PPP on threes.

The leagues median free throw percantage is around 77.6% which gives you an average of 1.54PP with  two free throws and 2.31PP if you get three free throws.

I belive this gap is too large and unjustified. I understand that the shooter had the oportunity to get three points if he had made the shot, but the shot he took also was harder to make. So naturally the free throw should also be further away than the regular free throw. We obviously don´t do that.

Only awarding two free throws would do multiple things. The defense would get tougher as it won´t be such a high risk to close out on shooters. Additionaly foul baiting would decrease as the advantage of getting fouled would be lower.

A problem I see is in clutch situations as a three point lead would be much harder to overcome, when the opponent could just foul you and you don´t get the opportunity to make up the difference.

What do you think about this idea? Do you think it makes a big difference? How would you fix the issue of clutch situations? Would you need to revert to current rules in the last two minutes?

I personally being a 2 seed is pretty ideal, because you face a pretty easy team in the first round, and then face some real competition in the 2nd round to unite your team more and put the players into competitive mode. This has been proven by teams like the Raptors last year, who went through a slog of a Sixers second round series before beating Milwaukee in 6 and effectively sweeping them.

For one, if it means he’ll play with more effort, I don’t see how that’s really that big a factor as everyone is going to put in more effort. If it means he gets better, how much will he get better by? Will his jump shots magically start going in because it’s the playoffs? There have been times when I watch LeBron and he takes jump shots and I think, “I don’t see this changing much in the playoffs, it’s not like you can try harder to make a jump shot go in”. Even with his drives, you can make the argument that he attempts more but i don’t think just attempting more drives warrants the respect everyone I’ve talked to gives to playoff LeBron.

o=ortg, d=drtg, u=usg%, ts=ts%


76ers Overall- 108.3o (20th), 106.2d (4th), 56.0ts (19th)


Embiid- 105.0 o, 100.5 d, 30.5u, 58.3ts

w/o Horford- 108.8o, 101.2d, 30.0u, 59.7ts

w/ Ben- 104.8 o, 103.0 d, 28.2 u, 60.7ts

w/o Ben- 104.6 o, 94.6 d, 34.9 u, 54.5ts


Thoughts on Embiid:

-Embiids drtg is unbelievable with Horford on, but still elite without him

-Embiids ortg is very very bad with Horford on, and very good (relative to the team) without him

-Embiid produces his best drtg without Ben, probably because the game is much slower when Ben sits


Horford- 107.2 o, 103.7 d, 17.9u, 52.2ts

w/ Embiid- 98.9o, 103.7 d, 10.9u, 52.7ts

w/ Ben- 108.1o, 103.9d, 17.2u, 53.1ts

w/o Ben- 98.5o, 98.3d, 21.8u, 46.4ts


Thoughts on Horford:

-Horfords ortg is very good (relative to the team) without Embiid, and very very bad with him on

-Horfords usage is cut in half when Embiid is on the floor

-Horfords drtg doesn't change much with or without Embiid

-Simmons is critical to Horfords offensive production, he is awful without him

-Horfords ts% is very bad when Ben sits, which makes sense. However its even lower when Embiid sits, which seems to make staggering them less effective


Ben- 109.2o, 106.9d, 20.2u, 61.0ts

w/ Embiid- 104.8o, 103.0d, 19.4u, 61.4ts

w/o Horford- 107.6o, 109.8d, 19.8u, 61.0ts


Thoughts on Ben:

-Bens ortg drops with Embiid on, probably because he contributes nothing on Embiid post up possessions

-The numbers suggest Bens fit with both stars is OK, but I hoped to see more synergy


Conclusion: These numbers confirm what we're all seeing with respect to the Sixers offense-- it sucks when Horford and Embiid share the floor. They also suggest that Horford's defensive contributions are't nearly as significant as the detrimental effect on the offense. Horford and Embiid should probably be staggered as much as possible, but Ben needs to be on the floor with Horford, and Horford's TS% drops significantly without Embiid.

Utah game a couple of days ago, ultimately costing Portland the game, I began to ponder about how bad the referees actually are and the history of the NBA and their referees. Referees are just like the rest of us, **human.** They have the ability to screw up and make heat-of-the-moment decisions that can be seen as a bad call. That's exactly what happened in the final seconds of the Portland game; Damian Lillard goes up for a potential game-tying bucket and gets ""blocked"" by Rudy Gobert. Everyone in the basketball community disagreed with the call in real-time, obviously seeing the basketball hit the backboard first and then the basketball getting blocked, which should've resulted in a goaltend. People were outraged and social media took a turn to criticize the referees and finally spark some mainstream media coverage on the referees. This year, and every year, bad calls are seen throughout every game of the NBA season, but it is beginning to become more of a staple rather than a discrepancy. Some notable non-calls or calls this season has been LeBron's no-call travel versus the Utah Jazz, Harden's dunk that didn't count eventually costing them the game, and then Lillard's no-call about the goaltending. If you're an avid NBA fan you'll notice these calls every game. 

That being said, I could bring up many situations where the refs really screwed up, like really screwed up. Take for example the infamous 2002 WCF with the Lakers v. Kings, where evidently there was something fishy going on with the refs in the series and game 6 in particular. It wasn't known then. however now that referee Tim Donaghy admitted to taking bets on some games and admitted there was rigging to bring the series to 7 games. Tim also included that the NBA would encourage refs to affect the outcomes of games. This has been a problem for years because the NBA is focused on getting the most views and revenue. Other examples are Jordan's ""Last Shot"" game-winner against the Utah Jazz, where he clearly pushed off Bryon Russell, Heat-Knicks ""flop fest"" in 2012, games 3-6 of the 2006 NBA Finals, or Charles Smith not getting a foul call in Game 5 of the 1993 ECF. But the one example I would like to elaborate on furthermore is the Bill Laimbeer phantom foul call of the 1988 NBA Finals Game 6 which kept Isiah Thomas and the Detroit Pistons from a potential championship and an incredibly memorable Game 6, scoring 25 points in the 3rd quarter after rolling his ankle. If you look back at the call, Bill Laimbeer does not commit a foul, but keeps his arms straight up and stands still while Kareem goes to his iconic hook shot, but a foul was called. Bill was not necessarily liked amongst his fellow peers and referees so this could be part of the reason, but something that was also missed was Kareem traveling. Kareem dribbled and shuffled his feet before attempting the hook shot. This was a huge call that should've went the other way and led to a Game 7— I just really wonder when refereeing will get better. I talk about this because this happened in '88 and cost one of the most hard-working and respectable players in basketball, Isiah Thomas, a potential championship. The refereeing isn't getting any better either, ticky-tack fouls are being called and refs are missing so many blatant calls that being an NBA referee is more of a joke now than a respectable profession. Given, the league is stepping up in the right direction by allowing coaches to challenge certain foul calls, that are rather very limited per game. I still think training refs should be more looked into and certain rules should be changed to adapt to help coaches, players, and the referees to be on the same page of the rules, getting calls, calling calls, and more. When will this be fixed, and what should the steps be in the right direction of refereeing not becoming a topic every day?",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,77877,public,self,"The NBA has a problem with its refereeing, but this has been a problem for decades ultimately letting teams and players down.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/f1jcsd/the_nba_has_a_problem_with_its_refereeing_but/,,,,,,,,,,,

Hypothesis: 3pt% is used to unfairly label some players as 'poor shooters'.

I began thinking about this after seeing media people comment on damian lillards ability to hit ""ridiculously deep"" 3's. I believe the numbers show that such shots for dame surprisingly dont show that steep a drop off compared to shooting right at the line, and that it is still a relatively efficient shot. 

This made me think that the reason for this is that given dame is expected to create shots off the dribble, he has developed a better sense of body control, and how to react to factors such as balance, and the speed that hes moving and the impact this has on the ball and therefore how to adapt his shot and release. 

My idea is that this has overlap to helping him more easily adapt to longer distances and added force of release etc. 

THIS led me to wonder whether many elite level shooters are overrated due to 3pt% and if its almost like shooting free throws for some of these guys.  For example bertans shoots 52% on corner 3's which i assume mostly are set shots. 

THEREFORE im wondering if players that are traditionally known as poor 3 pt shooters who are expected to create most of their shots off the dribble are actually more skilled than people give them credit for. For example westbrook or demar derozan (and other high volume bad 3pt% scorers).  Perhaps if an equal weight was given to catch and shoots 3pta as shots of the dribble the gap between the elite shooters and the poor shooters reduce?

It seems to me that all 3 sides, often, are unhappy with immovable contracts: the team with the overpaid player is stuck with an overpaid player, the overpaid player is stuck with the organization, and the team(s) that would otherwise be interested in the player are not able to get the player. The basis of a lot of these contracts are that players will always prefer money to wins/preferred franchises, etc, but we've seen especially in the last few years that this isn't always the case. For example, there's at least a chance that Chris Paul would have preferred to take a smaller contract &amp; go to a contender, but he didn't have the option to do that because he had a few more years left on his contract. 


What I'm asking is this: Why not allow for contracts to be renegotiated if *all parties, notably and including the player* agree that the contract should be changed? If I'm Chris Paul and 1) HOU wants to get off my contract, 2) I want to go to a different contender, and 3) MIL wants to sign me for $X, why can't I get a renegotiated contract that would solve all of these issues? An alternate would only be to allow this while that player is being traded as to prevent situations like Montrezl Harrell walking up to Clips management and demanding more money etc. 


Only problem I can see is that it increases player movement, but it would also correct a lot of the market failures that are associated with contract-based leagues.

My point is, it's not just the Rockets and Warriors doing this. More and more teams are trying out small-ball, most out of sheer desperation, to see if it works, and are getting comfortable with it.

As many of you know, Clint was traded in a deal that landed RoCo in Houston.

Now initially, a lot of people didnt know what Houston was thinking when they did that. Now they are fully committed to going small

Last night they faced the lakers and won pretty decisively behind Westbrooks 41/8/5

While it is only one game, I think their is a lot of positives from this game

1) Space and Pace

This one seems a given. They were running up and down the floor and with all the space the line up gave, guys like Russ were able to pressure the defense easily. Their was also a lot of quality looks whether it was from the 3 point line or just getting to the rim. The offence was fun to watch

2) Defense 

As predicted, AD managed to feast behind his 32/13/3 but the defensive scheme they have seems have an impact on the perimeter. The Lakers only managed to only shoot 29% from 3 which is always a killer, but Houston's ability to switch now with RoCo could have played a big factor in that.

While their are some positives to take from this game, I do have some concerns. 

1) Rebounding

While they did match up rebounding numbers with the Lakers last night, Im not fully convinced they can do it regularly. PJ, Russ, Harden, and RoCo are all great for their positions, Im curious to see if they can keep this up. I assume that because they shoot so many three's, the ball is more likely to end up bouncing out to the perimeter (I could be mistaken)

2) Energy and Effort

Playing small can be really taxing on the line ups body, so I'm wondering what will happen in the long haul. Something encouraging to see is that D'Antoni played 9 guys and only Russ and Harden played more than 35 minutes

Well thats all I got, it was a fun game to watch either way.

Here we take a look at ***24*** questions/ideas that have been fulfilled in the 2019-20 season.

### #PlayForKobe

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Jimmy Butler has found a home in Miami**

Pat Riley and Erik Spoelstra have practically settled in as a middle-of-the-pack team since moving on from the LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh trio.

There is a new star in town and that would be Jimmy Butler. Riley signed players like James Johnson, Dion Waiters, and Hassan Whiteside (no longer with the team) to questionable contracts. However, the new young talent he added in guys like Tyler Herro, Kendrick Nunn, and All-Star Bam Adebayo has given the Heat new standing in the East.

Also recall that Chris Paul was rumored to be a main target of this team over the summer. That talk appears to have all but vanished. South Beach is heating up again with Butler averaging career-highs of 9.4 FTA, 6.8 REB, 6.3 AST.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Derrick Rose Hall of Fame talk is also heating up**

D-Rose just recently ended his streak of 14 consecutive games with 20 or more points. That’s the first time that’s happened since his 2010-11 MVP campaign. It would surely be rare to see a regular season MVP winner actually miss the Hall of Fame but that’s where Rose appeared to be heading until the last year or so.

Despite scoring 50 points in a game while reuniting with Coach Tom Thibodeau in Minnesota last season, Rose missed over 30 games and the Timberwolves went down with him. Rose has played in 44 of 53 games this year, however, and has simply been terrific. That’s raised the question, “does Rose now deserve a spot in the Hall of Fame?”

Rose is shooting just shy of 50 percent from the field as well as averaging 25.2 points per 36 minutes. Both of those are career-best marks.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. The Nuggets are no fluke**

Denver battled with Golden State for first place in the West nearly the entire 2018-19 season and eventually came up three games short. As of today, the Lakers are the only Western Conference team with more wins. It’s a lot more than just winning numbers though. 

Nikola Jokic’s sensational offensive regime (20.6 PTS, 10.3 REB, 6.8 AST) gives them every reason they need to challenge (or actually be) the best of the West. The Nuggets are one of seven teams with a top-12 offensive efficiency and defensive efficiency and their defense has actually been slightly better than their offense.

This remains the team that overwhelms almost every other team with too much depth. The Nuggets would probably have to sacrifice some of that depth in order to get another star-caliber player alongside Jokic and Jamal Murray. The notion around the league seems to indicate that’s in their best interest.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. OKC is way better off after trading Westbrook/George**

Let’s quickly recap the Thunder’s offseason: traded Paul George to the Clippers for Danilo Gallinari, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and five future first-round picks (plus the right to swap picks), traded Russell Westbrook to the Rockets for Chris Paul and two future first-round picks (plus the right to swap two different picks), traded Jerami Grant to the Nuggets for a first-round pick, and drafted Darius Bazley.

OKC clearly intended to reset and proceed into rebuilding mode despite acquiring a win-now player in CP3. The difference after 50 games from last year: that’s right, only two games worse than the team led by Westbrook and George. 21-year-old Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (26.6 PTS per 100 possessions) is no pushover but a rising star.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Trae Young is the real deal**

I’m not sure it’s completely fair to proclaim him the second coming of Stephen Curry and here’s why: so many guards these days have a shoot-first mentality because they can really shoot the ball. Young is one of many but definitely does give us flashes of a young Curry the way he lets loose from the halfcourt logo.

Young is averaging almost 30 points in his sophomore season and Curry didn’t even average over 20 points until his fourth year in the league. It’s scary that Young still has so much room to improve, and in reality, has no ceiling whatsoever. You may not know he shoots better than 50 percent from inside the arc too.

Unfortunately the Hawks are one of the three most lowly-performing teams this season but Young figures to change that in due time. Atlanta pulled the trigger on trading for Clint Capela to bolster its frontcourt and that should go a long way in assisting Young in his quest for greatness.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. The Clippers know how sought-after Montrezl Harrell will be**

Montrezl Harrell (career 31.3 PTS, 11.6 REB per 100 possessions) is set to become an unrestricted free agent after this year. With or without him though, the Clippers do and will continue to have championship aspirations.

Here’s where they may run into a problem: L.A.C. has over $98 million tied into Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Patrick Beverley, Lou Williams and Ivica Zubac for next season. Harrell’s market is really going to be buzzing and the Clippers may be financially unable to meet his requests.

Here’s another thing about Harrell: he has missed just one game over the past two seasons and that makes him perhaps even more valuable based on the contract he is about to earn this offseason. That’s the type of competitor any team would welcome with open arms.

&amp;#x200B;

**7. Malcolm Brogdon is a really good player the Bucks don’t need**

This is anything but a knock on Malcolm Brogdon because he might be one of the most fundamentally sound players in the league. The Bucks just had enough firepower to withstand his loss without giving an inch to opposing contenders.

Therefore, this is more about how the Bucks contentedly built their team over the years rather than the individual destiny of Brogdon. He isn’t en enemy of Milwaukee either because this was the team responsible for giving him the freedom to transform from second-round pick to Rookie of the Year.

Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton and Eric Bledsoe give them everything that Brogdon gave them and more. Brogdon is now with the Pacers and could potentially match up with the Bucks should they escape the first round. That would be a fun matchup but a healthy Bucks team should easily win.

&amp;#x200B;

**8. Pascal Siakam is unarguably a franchise player**

Their Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard moved across the U.S. but the Raptors have somehow found a way to remain elite – at least in the company of Eastern Conference teams not named the Bucks.

Here’s a little clue: it’s mainly because of Pascal Siakam (2.1 3PM, 23.7 PTS, 7.7 REB), one of the top two-way players in the league and now a constant threat in the East. The Raptors are currently riding a franchise-best 12-game winning streak and they’ve even fared reasonably well through injuries (Siakam included).

Siakam was seen as more of an unsung hero at this time last year, like not quite an All-Star but more than serviceable as a second or third option and a certified pest defensively. Siakam has come a long way in a short period of time. Maybe the restaurants in Toronto should offer him free food since Leonard didn’t accept it.

&amp;#x200B;

**9. The Spurs are (finally) an average team at best**

The Spurs traded for DeMar DeRozan (53.7 FG%, 23.2 PTS, 5.2 AST) two summers ago with the intent of maintaining playoff legitimacy in the Western Conference. That hasn’t worked out so well though as it appears time is finally not their friend but their enemy.

LaMarcus Aldridge’s best days are behind him, and while he can still erupt for 30 points any given night, younger big men like Bam Adebayo, John Collins and Domantas Sabonis have surpassed him in convincing fashion. Soon enough there will be more players joining that list.

Dejounte Murray recently put the pen to paper on a four-year, $64-million extension but has yet to capitalize on the player we anticipated him to be. Murray might be fully recovered from his torn ACL but he’s clearly still adapting to the situation while playing just 24 minutes per game.

&amp;#x200B;

**10. Brandon Ingram is finally showing his KD-like tendencies**

Being drafted by the Lakers gave Brandon Ingram all the attention he needed as soon as he entered the league in the 2016-17 season. By the standards there, however, Ingram was underwhelmingly nothing more than a solid player and turned into more of a trade rumor topic when LeBron James signed there.

The trade to the Pelicans has given Ingram new life and he’s emerged on the scene and blossomed into an All-Star before our eyes. It might be a reach to compare anyone to Kevin Durant but an early-career Ingram isn’t a terrible comparison.

Ingram is one of 13 players averaging 25 points per game and is now very reliable beyond the perimeter where he shoots exactly 40 percent.

&amp;#x200B;

**11. Andre Iguodala’s work is not finished**

The 2015 Finals MVP has collected three Larry O’Brien trophies in the last five years as a member of the Warriors, who felt obligated to trade him for salary reasons. Iguodala refused to report to the Grizzlies, the team that traded for him, and his wish was finally granted with him now heading to Miami.

At this point in his career, Iguodala wants one thing and that’s more championship rings. There were several suitors for the 36-year-old swingman who has done it all from winning championships to hitting game-winning shots to claiming All-Defensive honors and so forth.

Is there any team (especially contender) that couldn’t use Iguodala? He’s a guy there’s always room for regardless of how solidified a team’s rotation is more than halfway through the season. That’s why the Heat conceded a young asset in Justise Winslow for Iguodala’s services.

&amp;#x200B;

**12. Big men continue to get the most credit on defense**

Since Michael Jordan won the award in the 1987-88 season, 13 of the 17 Defensive Player of the Year winners have been big men (when including power forwards Draymond Green and Dennis Rodman). That’s not unordinary with guys like today’s Rudy Gobert, the back-to-back DPOY, having the height, wingspan and motor to thoroughly affect the game on that side of the ball.

There certainly is a fair share of lockdown perimeter defenders but that seems to blend in as more of a team effort. Gobert and Draymond Green have something in common: that’s being able to protect the rim but also have the versatility to defend quicker players at times. Anthony Davis appears to have made his way into the conversation to dethrone Gobert and it’s very possible with how effective the Lakers’ defense has been this season.

&amp;#x200B;

**13. The Celtics’ team chemistry has been restored**

It was apparent that last year’s team was lacking a locker room connections amongst all the players. Al Horford is not an easy guy to lose for that matter because his leadership has been well-documented throughout his career. However, questions surrounding Kyrie Irving’s leadership have also been well-documented.

The Celtics were hopeful Kemba Walker would not only take the keys to the offense but also be the vocal leader this team apparently needed. Does Irving get too much negative speculation over his leadership skills? Yes, he probably does but that isn’t to disregard what this team was missing last year.

Another year and another loaded roster filled with talent for the Celtics. Now they need something to show for it on the court when it comes playoff time.

&amp;#x200B;

**14. The Blake Griffin trade isn’t looking great in hindsight**

This take wouldn’t have been accepted last season as Blake Griffin had the best all-around season of his career. The root of the problem was overworking Griffin last year to the point where he just wasn’t the same by the time the playoffs came around and that has yet to change with him likely being shut down for the remainder of this season.

That being said, I’m not one to be extra critical of the move by Pistons former management because the deal didn’t look half bad at the time. The Pistons were hungry for a franchise player and perhaps Griffin could have been that long-term if they had simply managed his workload better.

Sometimes it’s tough to judge anything outside of the present-day scenario and that would be the two years, $75 million remaining on his contract following this year. The Pistons are in need of a bold move that pays off.

&amp;#x200B;

**15. Damian “Dame Time” Lillard is officially unstoppable**

Damian Lillard (career-highs 46.1 FG%, 29.7 PTS, 7.9 AST) has saluted the late legend with a string of 40-and-50-point performances reminiscent of the great Kobe Bryant. His scoring totals were as follows from January 20th through February 1st: 61, 47, 50, 36, 48 and 51.

Recall that Kobe scored 40 points or more in a period of nine straight games in the 2002-03 season. Then in 2007, he scored at least 50 points in four consecutive games. Lillard shot about 57 percent from three-point land on a whopping 49 made triples in his respective series of games.

The crazy thing about Lillard is that he’s a five-time All-Star but he’s never been named a starter. That’s not necessarily a shocker only because players on winning teams, such as Stephen Curry and James Harden, have gained more popularity in the media. Lillard has been the unscripted underdog for so long and it’s about time that’s changed.

&amp;#x200B;

**16. Draymond Green is still a necessity for the Warriors’ success**

Draymond Green is well on his way to becoming one of the winningest players in NBA history. Since averaging 49 wins in his first two years in the league, the Warriors have won 57, 58, 67 (twice) and 73 games in each individual season. That’s until this season in which Green is finally on the other end of the totem pole.

I have a problem with calling this a lost season for he and the Warriors though. Sometimes you have to drop down in order to get back up. Therefore, the Warriors will be playing to win as long as Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson come back to full strength and both are young enough to be able to do so.

That leads me to this: in the midst of all these young rising stars, the Warriors need Green just as much as they ever have. It doesn’t matter how much more explosive or athletic an opponent is because he will continue to thrive and preach success off his towering I.Q. on both ends of the floor. 

&amp;#x200B;

**17. The Wizards are really missing their All-Star point guard**

Although the roster makeup has changed quite a bit, it’s been over a year since five-time All-Star John Wall has been on the floor with his teammates. Wall really built his resume over the years and eventually developed into one of the league’s most dangerous athletes.

Since Wall has been out, it’s been backcourt mate Bradley Beal that’s picked up the slack. Wall’s absence has allowed Beal to expand his game in different areas, especially when it comes to playmaking. Whatever the case may be, Beal needs Wall back if this team is ever going to get back on track.

Wall and Beal’s contracts amount to over $140 million combined after this year and that’s not taking their third-year player options into account. The Wizards will have to make it work.

&amp;#x200B;

**18. Pacers management has been stellar since dealing Paul George**

If you ask me, critics are wrong about half of the time and those critics couldn’t have been more incorrect when looking at the Paul Goerge deal in hindsight. At the time, Victor Oladipo was seen as a steady two-way player but that changed immediately after he was traded from OKC before the 2017-18 season.

Oladipo might not have all the ability that George did but he is just as committed (especially on defense). Oladipo has played only 40 games the past two seasons. The Pacers have stayed afloat during that time though because of the tough identity and work ethic he brought there.

Oladipo is a two-time All-Star and now Domantas Sabonis (54.0 FG%, 25.9 PTS, 17.9 REB per 100 possessions), the other piece they acquired in the George deal, was also just named an All-Star. In addition to that, if Malcolm Brogdon isn’t an All-Star then he has to be something close.

&amp;#x200B;

**19. Luka Doncic’s rise to stardom didn’t take long**

It’s tough to call out the Suns for picking someone like Deandre Ayton because most other teams probably would have done the same. I think the entire league has already come to fruition with 20-year-old Luka Doncic, not just being a rare type of franchise player, but also a generational talent coming out of Europe.

Doncic is somewhere in between his predecessor Dirk Nowitzki and a young LeBron James. He’s making plays right now that James wouldn’t have even made in his sophomore season. Of course Doncic can’t attack the rim like James could but he possesses the same unselfish mentality and unprecedented playmaking skills.

Oh and another thing: the Mavs are making their Vegas over/under projection of 40.5 wins look foolish thanks to Doncic (28.8 PTS, 9.5 REB, 8.7 AST). He has taken Kristaps Porzingis under his wing and Porzingis doesn’t seem to mind being the complementary star.

&amp;#x200B;

**20. There’s still room for Dwight Howard and Carmelo Anthony**

Until just recently, it’s been several years since both Dwight Howard and Carmelo Anthony were appreciated on their respective teams.

This is Howard’s second go-around with the Lakers, and while his stats aren’t nearly as good on paper, he has embraced a smaller role while accepting less responsibility on offense. He’s still expected to do what he’s always done on defense.

Anthony can be hard to gauge as it’s unclear how much he has left in the tank. This year, however, he has definitely taken a step forward while gaining the trust of Blazers coach Terry Stotts. Melo is shooting his best three-point percentage since 2013-14 and he’s still never averaged below 32 MPG outside of his short stint with Houston.

&amp;#x200B;

**21. The Knicks are still trying to figure things out**

We hear nonstop about the Knicks repeatedly targeting marquee free agents and ultimately failing to bring them in. Marcus Morris wasn’t a bad consolation prize but he didn’t exactly make sense for a Knicks team with no apparent direction.

Like Kristaps Porzingis, Morris was also traded cross-conference to a team looking to make noise sooner rather than later. The Porzingis situation is still lingering on this franchise because there was initially so much hope surrounding him there.

There’s really only one way for the Knicks to get out of this mess and that’s hitting home-runs on all of their upcoming draft picks, which is a lot easier said than done.

&amp;#x200B;

**22. There’s no more waiting, Devin Booker’s time is now**

First of all, I would like to piggyback off that header by saying Devin Booker is probably one of the more notable All-Star snubs in recent All-Star snub history. Look, there are a lot of great players and major depth at guard in the Western Conference. However, Booker can’t possibly be doing any more for his team right now.

Put an asterisk mark by his 2019-20 season statistics which show him shooting better than 50 percent from the field while averaging 26.7 points and 6.3 assists. On top of that, the Suns aren’t miserably bad like they had been his first four years.

Perhaps another 70-point performance would wake up everyone that’s sleeping on him because Phoenix might still have a ways to go before approaching the playoff conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

**23. The Andrew Wiggins/Karl-Anthony Towns experiment didn’t go as planned**

The Wolves have lost 13 straight games and counting. Let’s just say the ball has not bounced their way as of late and the Andrew Wiggins trade rumors finally turned into a reality. Wiggins (30.3 PTS per 100 possessions) was getting a lot of praise earlier this season but that has quieted down since.

They took a chance on Jimmy Butler a couple of years ago and that never panned out either. They did, however, just trade for D’Angelo Russell who is a close friend of Karl-Anthony Towns. Russell now joins his fourth team in five seasons and we can only hope he flourishes as the veteran point guard Minnesota needed.

As for K.A.T., he remains one of the highest-upside players in the entire league. While he’ll be counting on Russell to give him the support he needs, the Timberwolves could still be looking at significant offseason changes.

&amp;#x200B;

**24. The Rockets can’t be considered the contenders they were the last few years**

As great as it is seeing two former MVPs in James Harden and Russell Westbrook reunited, there are still some glaring doubts about whether the Rockets have enough to compete with the best of the West.

The Rockets rank in the top three of the league in offensive efficiency for the fourth straight season while Harden (nearly 36 PPG over last two years) is an offensive superhero that can’t be contained defensively. I don’t know if it’s fair to say this team will go as far as he takes them though.

Reason being is that he shouldn’t be at fault for making this team one-dimensional at times. General Manager Daryl Morey is always looking for ways to enrich the foundation he started building early last decade but he also tries to win with a different methodology, as we can see with Clint Capela recently being dealt.",False,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,77426,public,self,24 conclusions at the NBA trade deadline,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/f0cj1l/24_conclusions_at_the_nba_trade_deadline/,,,,,,,,,,,

Alternatively, which teams appear to have gotten the WORST deals?

Here are some of my thoughts so far:

Rockets: I was extremely skeptical of Houston trading away their talented big man (Capela) for what seemed like so little. After last night's win over the Lakers and the Rockets' performance without a big man presence, they might not have made the worst decision. Still, I doubt their aggressive small ball strategy will remain sustainable over the course of the rest of the season. PJ Tucker is one hell of a defender for getting bodied by AD for as long as he did last night, but I doubt he'll be able to keep it up (serious props to the guy for it though).

Warriors: Picks. Lots of them. Not sure where GSW is going, but I'm excited to see the direction they take their franchise in. Maybe they're putting the pieces together to build a solid core around the Splash Bros?

Cavs: Getting Drummond was a steal, but can they make him stay? Moreover, how does he fit in with TT and Kevin Love? Maybe they'll get lucky with the lottery and build a team around Drummond. I'm keeping my eye on them to see what their next move will be.

76ers: These two players SHOULD be what Philly needs right now; solid players who can SHOOT THE THREE might finally take some pressure off Embiid and prevent teams from running a 2-3 zone on the 76ers on defense. We have yet to see if Philly can capitalize on them.

Timberwolves: KAT and DLo united at last. If those two get a good chemistry going, they should be a blast to watch. I don't think that team will be contending anytime soon, but at least they'll put together some sexy highlight reel footage.

Heat: The Heat made so many moves that I'm almost a little bit nervous. I'm a big believer in the ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"" mentality. If your team is doing well and you trade away a player who doesn't LOOK like he's contributing, you never know if that guy was actually a great presence behind the scenes or in the locker room being a leader for his teammates in some way or another. Still, even though I have my concerns, I think the Heat are going to continue to be on fire for the rest of the season under the leadership of Butler as they enter into the playoffs.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,77426,public,self,Which teams did the best/worst in the trading game now that the deadline is over?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/f0cb0q/which_teams_did_the_bestworst_in_the_trading_game/,,,,,,,,,,,

Embiid is going to come back to form. Even with his sluggishness, his shooting is not that bad. He makes about 50% more of his shots than he did tonight without his hand being wrapped. Burks and Robinson are going to get so many open looks from three and will drastically improve the horrid offense, even if it's just by making their shots. JRich is set to come back. He always plays with the Mamba mentality and is so good at the PnR with Ben. His outside shooting and especially his great defense will be a MAJOR upgrade heading forward. With all of their problems tonight, including the fact that Philly shot 22% from midrange, that 11-point loss (smallest of the losing streak) seems like a better place to be for this team than the previous three games. Finally, they have the easiest schedule for the remainder of the season. Will it be enough to move up to the 2 or 3 seed? Probably not.

If he meshes well with the Cavs young roster can’t the Cavs sign him to an extension and with their (assumingely high) draft pick have a pretty decent squad for next year? 
Also, if he ends up leaving in the off-season anyway the Cavs have a ton of money to spend for the expense of 2 guys barely getting minutes and a 2nd round pick.

The Sixers traded away 2020 Mavs 2nd rounder, Nugs 2021 2nd rounder, and Raps 2022 2nd rounder

Could this trade offer Philly some much needed floor spacing? As of right now, the 76ers do not have a member of their starting five (simmons, richardson, harris, horford, embiid) who shoots above 35% from three.

Perhaps a good move would even be to have horford come off the bench in favor of Glenn Robinson getting a start? Or maybe run Alec Burks at the 2 and have Josh Richardson come off the bench?

These two players could seriously breathe some life into the 76ers' rotations if utilized correctly. Right now, teams are able to run 2-3 zones against the 76ers since they know that most of them will not be able to hit open shots at a decent rate. The 2-3 zone also allows for defenders to collapse in, quickly closing off scoring opportunities for inside scoring, which is Philly's biggest strength. Having a threat from outside could free up Simmons or Embiid to work their magic inside.

My initial reaction is that Memphis FO is killing it. Got a first to absorb Iggy then traded him for a great(if injured) young player. I'm really excited to watch Memphis' end of the season. Hopefully Winslow will come back and be another ball handler and is built like a truck. Ja and JJJ are already a great foundation.

I honestly don't think this moves the needle for Miami at all. Iggy hasn't been good during the regular season in like 3 years, he wasn't even good last playoffs. I understand that he is more than his box scores, but the dude is declining and hasn't played basketball in almost a year. Maybe a miami fan can fill me in a bit.

They are able to do this by having it a pre determined site (I avoid saying Neutral since it is possible for a team to play in a superbowl at their home stadium. For example, if the Bucs win the NFC next year they will play the superbowl in their home stadium). This allows the NFL to have their hall of fame voting here. More importantly, it allows for a shit ton of NFL players and NFL media to go to the host location for a week of events.

A benefit the NBA would have is since their finals are in June, they can play them anywhere in North America and not have inclement weather be a problem. All 30 franchise locations could work as host. You could also have Seattle, Las Vegas, St. Louis, Kansas City, Tampa Bay, Montreal, Mexico City host along with other cities. Shit, have London or Paris make bids. 

My idea is to have playoff series be 3 games each. The higher seed plays the 1st and 3rd games at their arena and the lower seed plays the 2nd game at their facility. This way, there is more urgency. Every game matters way more. It will improve ratings.

The following [chart](https://i.imgur.com/2OSVZ7X.png) shows all the shots scored on Bam Adebayo's ASSISTS.

So let's describe a little about what's going on here. Bam very often operates in the area of ​​three point line, in the sense that he often gives a screen and hands the ball to a player who then kicks off the triple or drives to the hhoop. Such actions account for a greater number of his assists on the three. This information can also be easily seen through statistics, as Duncan Robinson leads the league in points from hand-off, and Tyler Herro and Kendrick Nunn are also good, both in the top 15 in points from hand-offs. #BamEffect

Bam is also a very fluid player when it comes to running the ball, sometimes leading the counterattack (after a brilliantly played defense) that ends with a good pass forward. Also, good technique often allows him to take on slower centers through drives. Often, these actions also end up dunking because he is very athletic.

And in the end I would just touch on his jump shot from mid-range. It's one of the segments he still lacks to become an All-NBA player (with a slightly better post game) and he is working on it, already after just over half a season he has more mid-range shots than last year.

The following [chart](https://i.imgur.com/2OSVZ7X.png) shows all the shots scored on Bam Adebayo's ASSISTS.

So let's describe a little about what's going on here. Bam very often operates in the area of ​​three point line, in the sense that he often gives a screen and hands the ball to a player who then kicks off the triple or drives to the hhoop. Such actions account for a greater number of his assists on the three. This information can also be easily seen through statistics, as Duncan Robinson leads the league in points from hand-off, and Tyler Herro and Kendrick Nunn are also good, both in the top 15 in points from hand-offs. #BamEffect

Bam is also a very fluid player when it comes to running the ball, sometimes leading the counterattack (after a brilliantly played defense) that ends with a good pass forward. Also, good technique often allows him to take on slower centers through drives. Often, these actions also end up dunking because he is very athletic.

And in the end I would just touch on his jump shot from mid-range. It's one of the segments he still lacks to become an All-NBA player (with a slightly better post game) and he is working on it, already after just over half a season he has more mid-range shots than last year. More about that later..

Given the talk about trade offers and packages surrounding D’lo, I thought now was a good time to post this. D’Angelo Russell has been one of my favorite players since he was drafted in 2015 with the 2nd pick. As a Warriors fan since the 2008 We Believe team with my East team being the Nets, I’ve been lucky enough to watch a lot of highly skilled players play for both of my teams. I believe D’Angelo Russell is underrated by the general fanbase of both Warriors and NBA as a whole and I’ve included a variety of \xa0strengths, weaknesses, misconceptions, and highlights to back my argument. I’ve also included a deeper look into the advanced stats and the picture of the player that D’Angelo has the potential to become.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n**Elite Vision:**\n\n\nLet\'s start with his vision.\xa0D’Angelo Russell is one of the best passers in the league and there aren’t many players I would put above him in terms of court vision. He can make almost any type of pass and he is very creative with his passing. Let’s break down what makes him elite.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nStarting with [transition...](https://streamable.com/yfxar) D’Angelo Russell is great in transition. He takes his time and always seems to have a mental picture of how players are coming down the floor. He will slow down and make the right passes in delayed transition to streaking bigs, or he’ll whip a no look pass to the player cutting backdoor as he pulls the defensive attention. Even when he doesn’t actively push the pace with his handles, his outlets are sharp and accurate and delivered with a surprising zip behind them - keeping it flashy often both with look offs and no looks. He’ll also drop it off or leave it for the trailer when appropriate.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nWhen holding the ball early in the shot clock, D’Lo doesn’t dictate how he wants the offense to set up too often. He carefully surveys the floor and will make [quick, early passes](https://streamable.com/z3cal) when his teammates pick up a sliver of an advantage. He is great at finding these tight windows and seeing his teammates open. Playing with a guard like this encourages the whole team to cut hard knowing you’ll be hit when you’re open. He is also great at finding shooters. [Imagine if these passes are going to Curry and Klay](https://streamable.com/8u70o). He is unselfish and many times will have the touch swing pass to the open shooter so quickly the ball is almost never in his hands.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThat brings me to my next point - D’Angelo is one of the best guards in the league at hitting teammates **in stride** and in the perfect window on cuts… [in addition to throwing the defenders off with where his eyes are looking.](https://streamable.com/i2je9)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIf you caught the end of the last GIF, then you’ll know what’s coming next. D’Angelo Russell is **THE BEST** lob passer in the NBA today. [He’s got every lob in the book](https://streamable.com/gr41j), and he’s showing out with lob targets like WCS, Paschall, Burks, GR3, Green, and Chriss. He can pass both directions with either hand; he can pass across his body with his off arm and opposite his momentum; he can hit oop targets from half court and look them off; he can alleyoop under hand on the drive, chest passes from 30 feet; he is so deadly with the pull-up 3 that bigs need to slightly hedge the screen and if the big slips and the defense is a step late, D’Lo will have already fired a pass for a dunker. He can get to the midrange and put his defender in jail, draw the help who are playing against his floater, and lob a soft pass over their arms. He will throw alley oops in transition if someone is a step late to streaking bigs.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nHowever his best pass isn’t his lob - I would say it’s his [pocket pass to rollers in the PnR.](https://streamable.com/lcxly) If you were familiar with D’Lo in college, you might remember [this clip.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JofVWECgfU) He is a wizard with bounce passing and splitting defenders. It is almost surgical the way he repositions and resets screens until the angle is just right for him to rifle a pass between someones legs for an easy dunk. Harden is another great pocket passer but one thing that D’Angelo clearly has over him - the comfort of using either hand, and passing either direction. His pocket passes are a thing of beauty.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Measurables/Athleticism:**\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nHere\xa0are some of the measurables that we can compare to the average NBA guard. According to DraftExpress, the average height of a guard for both SG and PG is about 6’4 with shoes. The average wingspan is 6’7 and average max vertical is 36.4"". D’Angelo Russell is above average in all measurables. He stands at 6’5 with shoes with a measured wingspan of 6’9.75. This wingspan was measured at age 19, and judging by some pictures I would not be surprised if this has grown to \xa06’10 or even 6’11. The usual age for wingspan to stop growing is around 21 or 22 for males. His max vertical at the combine was 39"". I am sure that this number is shocking to some as Russell is not known as an athletic player, but here are some names around the NBA known for their athleticism with similar vertical numbers at the combine:\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nJohn Wall - 39""\n\n\nAndre Iguodala - 34.5""\n\n\nJimmy Butler - 39""\n\n\nRussell Westbrook - 36.5""\n\n\nBlake Griffin - 35.5""\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nIs [this](https://streamable.com/2k6f0) what an [unathletic](https://streamable.com/i804f) guard [looks](https://imgur.com/EgJSCn9) like?\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nI am not arguing that D\'Angelo is athletic in comparison to other NBA guards. I am acutely aware that max vertical is not what we see in a high level basketball game and it’s rare to be able to elevate to your max in a competitive environment. I am also aware that D’Angelo rarely shows off his athleticism. However, I believe this is a deliberate,\xa0stylistic choice in how he chooses to play the game and utilize his strengths. He is almost always in control both with and without the ball. He is always very careful in setting up his positioning in the half court and will take his time to reposition screens to use them to their highest effectiveness. In this way, he reminds me of James Harden who also doesn’t explode off your computer screen with his athleticism although it’s clear that they both possess it. Another part of athleticism that is not as easy to see is deceleration. D’Angelo has elite deceleration and can stop on a dime and get into a jump shot as [smoothly](https://streamable.com/h1ikn) as anyone else in the league. Seriously, check out how tough that shot is.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\xa0The main two things I see missing in terms of athleticism are:\n\n\n1. Slow lateral movement making it easy for other guards to blow past him.\n\n2. Lack of a quick,\xa0explosive first step to allow him to blow by his defender easily. More on this later.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**2019/20 Season Advanced Stats and Changes Adjusting to the Warriors Offensive System:**\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIn the 2019/20 season, D’Angelo Russell will be **24 years old** in his fifth season. His averages on this season are **24/3.6/6.3/1** in 32 mpg.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nAs a D’Angelo Russell fan, I knew his game came with a lot of pull-up jumpers and was heavily reliant on his pick and roll threat to get to most of his spots. I believed he would not be able to contribute off ball as much as he already has this season and thought it’d take much more time to get accustomed to the Warriors brand of basketball. Through 30 games for the Warriors this year, I no longer hold this bias and I am getting increasingly excited to watch him to play alongside Klay and Curry.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome key areas of improvement over last seasons All Star berth:\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n- Increase in **FTA** from 2.5 to **4.4**. This is a key increase that is necessary in increasing efficiency and becoming a star guard in the league. The top guards all are able to draw FT at a respectable rate and he has more than doubled this.\n\n\n- Shooting **72% at the rim** with cuts off the ball and [crafty finishes like this](https://streamable.com/a8b5x). This is the 100th percentile for guards and could be a bit of a fluke. When he gets to the rim this season he has been elite at finishing. However, it’s a career low attempts at the rim. Only 8% of his attempts are within 4 feet of the basket. \n\n- Lowering **TOV%** every year since entering the league, down to a **career low 11.8%** from 15.6%\n\n- D’Angelo is shooting **51% from long mid-range** classified as 14 feet out to inside the 3 point line. This is in the 91st percentile in efficiency and when taking into account the volume of midranges that D’Angelo takes, \xa0he can only be compared to **Chris Paul** who’s also having an amazing season from midrange.\xa0As a reference, **Kevin Durant** shot 51%, 49%, and 54% (WOW) from the \xa0same distance in his 3 years with the Warriors.\n\n- Increase in 3P% from 36.9% on 7.8 attempts per game last year to **38.3% on 9.4 attempts per game** this year. This is an increase in efficiency and also volume! Breaking down the 3P% leads to even more interesting improvements.\n\n- When D’Lo is [coming off a screen](https://streamable.com/pexqy), the Warriors are scoring at **1.11 PPP**. He attempts 2.9 shots a game off of this type of shot. For context, Paul George leads the league at 3.8 and D’Lo’s similar company in attempts would be **Buddy Hield**, **Joe Harris**, and other shooters known for their off ball tendencies. The efficiency can be compared to **Paul George** and **JJ Redick** at 1.12 and 1.14PPP respectively. Compare this to last year at 0.83 PPP on 0.7 attempts per game, it’s a huge bump in efficiency and scoring while more than quadrupling the attempts.\n\nFor contextual reference for all further PPP stats - in the 2019/2020 season, the Mavericks are leading the league with 1.16 PPP, Bucks are second with 1.14 PPP. League average is at 1.09 PPP.\n\n\n- In **spot up** situations, his ability to function as an off ball player is even more apparent as it rises to a **1.30 PPP - in the 95th percentile amongst other elite shooters**. \xa0\n\n- D’Angelo Russell shot 39.4% on **catch and shoot** 3’s the previous year. The number of attempts was 3.3 per game. That number has skyrocketed to a flaming **42.4% on 4.1 attempts per game**. Here are some samples of what these catch and shoot 3’s [look like](https://streamable.com/pexqy). These are not normal difficulty catch and shoots. These are **difficult** catch and shoots that are shots created through off-ball movement and threat to shoot. The sets are similar to the ones used to set up Klay and Curry for off ball shots and are coming full sprint to turn and square in the air and shoot while the defender is trailing. \n\n\n- **Isolation** shots: Similar attempts per game at **2.3** to other offensive stars like Paul George, Trae Young, Bradley Beal, and Devin Booker. He scores at **1.03 PPP** in these situations similar with players like **Kawhi Leonard**, **Trae Young**, **Luka Doncic**, and **Kyrie Irving**. The ability to create a shot with a live dribble is always essential to a lineups offensive potential and also is a great bailout shot when you aren’t able to get to what you want. He’s shooting **36% \xa0on pull up 3’s at 5.4 a game**!\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n**Offensive Team Impact:**\n\n\n- \xa0**93rd percentile in assist percentage** - this is \xa0the percentage of shots he assists teammates on while on the floor\n\n\n- When D’Lo is on the court, he **increases the Warriors eFG% by 4.6%**! This is 97th percentile in the NBA. Yes, this can be attributed to the fact that his backup is probably not at an NBA level. It is still a huge increase. He also increases the number of 3’s shot \xa0at a +6% frequency, which is in the 95th percentile. For someone with his \xa0shot profile ( a lot of midrange shots), you would expect the team to shoot more midrange when he’s on the floor. This is the opposite, the team shoots 2% less midrange and 6% more from 3 because of the shots he is able to generate for teammates.\n\n\n- Team shot accuracy at the rim +7.0% - 97th percentile\n\n- Team shot accuracy at short midrange +7.7% - 94th percentile\n\n- Team shot accuracy at long midrange +7.9% - 90th percentile.\n\n- Team shot accuracy at all midrange +7.6% - 98th percentile\n\n- **These are not fluky numbers, these percentage increase and percentiles show similar improvements over the last 4 years of his career.**\n\n- His offensive BPM (OBPM) is at 5.1 this year which would put him 11th in the league. This stat is a good indicator of offensive prowess as we can note from the top 10 that they are all cornerstone pieces in the elite offenses in the NBA. This stat puts him significantly ahead of players like Butler, Anthony Davis, and Lowry while being on par with Jokic, Kemba, and Beal on offensive contribution.\n\n- He has the [clutch gene](https://streamable.com/2gqtp). Patented celebration for clutch shots so early in his career.\n\n- Just a [tough shot maker](https://streamable.com/n03k5). The degree of difficulty of a lot of his shots is extremely tough.\n\n- Additionally, he has a [great pump fake](https://streamable.com/ovai4) that allows him to lose the man closing out on him and relocate to an open three pointer.\n\n- Speaking of [relocation](https://streamable.com/29heq), D’Angelo has learned from Steph Curry the art of relocation after driving and using off ball movement to get the ball back for open shots that were generated from his initial drives.\n\n- He has the ability to catch fire and carry an offense for quarters at a time. He can go supernova, he just has the ""it"" factor stars need in the NBA.\n\n\xa0 \xa0 - 52 \xa0point game this season\n\n\xa0 \xa0 - 35, \xa037 point \xa0games with 9 3’s\n\n\xa0 \xa0 - 1/3 of \xa0his games with 30+\n\n\xa0 \xa0 - [Awesome heat checks](https://streamable.com/94rxq)\n\n\xa0 \xa0 - [Scoring first \xa015 \xa0points, 18 of first 27, \xa08 3’s at the half](https://streamable.com/t1zvj)\n\n\xa0 \xa0 - [10 points straight in 1:20 gamete - consecutive 4 possessions](https://streamable.com/ga4z2)\n\n\xa0 \xa0 - [12 points straight in less than a minute game time - consecutive 4 possessions](https://streamable.com/39oe4)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Defense:**\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nAs I traced D’Angelo’s defensive issues this year, \xa0I categorized them into three main issues\n\n\n1. D’Angelo gets nullified by screens easily both on and off ball. His inability to fight through is apparent.\n\n2. D’Angelo is [unable to catch up laterally with the first step and is never able to position himself between the offensive player and the rim leading to an easy layup](https://streamable.com/k2za8)\n\n3. D’Angelo is [not hustling](https://streamable.com/is4rm), either in transition not sprinting back or just looking lethargic in closeouts. He even makes Joe Ingles look nimble.\n\n\nHowever, his insanely low DRTG can be attributed to hot shooting by the man he \xa0is guarding. Opponents are shooting 44% from 3 against Russell - almost 8% points better than their average.\xa0 I’m sure it can be \xa0partially attributed t o Russell’s \xa0poor defense and lack of hustle, but \xa0at \xa0such an \xa0outlier, \xa0it’s clear that \xa0luck is also \xa0playing \xa0a big part in bringing down his defensive numbers. In his two years in Brooklyn, he did alright defending the perimeter, \xa0but like the eye test suggests, he was horrible at stopping players from scoring at the rim and showed an inability to stay between them and the basket.\n\n\nThere were a few positives I noticed from Russell’s defense as well.\n\n\n1. [In this clip](https://streamable.com/8c38u), \xa0D’Lo sees Green fall for the pump fake. As Chriss rotates as the primary help, he leaves behind Tristan Thompson wide open for the dump off. D’Lo sees this so he takes two quick steps to box out Tristan, leaving his man open in the corner but taking \xa0away the wide open dunk. He then recovers to his man for an OK contest.\n\n2. [In this clip](https://streamable.com/0wfhk), Myles Turner has sealed his man and is wide open for the lob pass for an easy two.\xa0 D’Angelo spots this and stunts hard towards Turner, taking away the initial pass. He then sees his man get swung the ball and attempts to deflect it out but misses and gets scored on.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nAlthough he gets scored on in both clips, they both showed a defensive IQ and awareness to take away the highest percentage look. What’s missing is the hustle required to turn these smart plays into stops.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n[Some more positives here](https://streamable.com/idjtr). Russell has great wingspan and a good percentage of his steals are from surprising the other team with his reach, getting deflections and steals that \xa0seem unexpected.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n[He also shows good defensive timing](https://streamable.com/76y76) akin to Andre Iguodala when he’s able to position well and contest drives.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Areas of Improvement:**\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThere are several areas of improvement that need to happen for D’Lo to take the next step\n\n\nBiggest Weaknesses:\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSlow \xa0lateral movement, easily blown by - hopefully with his decrease in usage, he is able to use more energy on defense and live up to his potential on that end. He has been in the top USG% in the NBA the past 4 years. Additionally, hopefully playing for a winning team with a winning culture will help him realize what kinds of hustle plays are expected day in and day out of the 82 \xa0game season. He’s still early enough in his career to be able to make a \xa0drastic change on that end. He has been at the top of the Nets in deflections and loose balls controlled and I want to see him bring that same hustle here.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nLabeled as a chucker - I believe that his shot profile will change dramatically after adding back Steph and Klay.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n[Careless turnovers](https://streamable.com/xkgv4) - This reminds me of Steph Curry but there is a tradeoff in creativity, passing, and freedom on the court that will result \xa0in silly turnovers at bad times. This has to be cleaned up similar to how Curry had forced himself out of \xa0those bad habits earlier in \xa0his \xa0career. Remember those bets with Mama Curry? Some of that would be great here.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nNot a good FT shooter - for how amazing a shooter D’Lo is, he doesn’t have \xa0that same consistency at the line\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nShot a career low in the short mid-range from 4-14 feet. In 4 years before GSW, he shot 45%. This year it’s down to 38%. I think this is an anomaly that will bounce back given D’Angelo’s [great and varied floater game](https://streamable.com/qvzhe).\xa0 He really demonstrates nice touch on these floaters and they’ve been a staple of his offensive game since he joined the league.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n**Can he work in a system with Steph and Klay and Green?**\n\n\n\nImagine D’Angelo as the trigger man at the top of the key, with Steph and Klay coming off of down screens on either wing. Any wrong action by the defense (over playing \xa0the shot if Curry or Klay get a step) can result in a lob \xa0pass for a dunk to the screener or hitting two of the best shooters in the game for a catch and shoot. Now also imagine D’lo being one of the shooters coming off of the down screen and getting swung the ball with the options to shoot, pass, or drive. He’s already shown in just 1/3 of \xa0the season that he is able to contribute as both an off ball player and a ball distributor in Kerr’s system. Adding the pick and roll with D’Angelo as a floor spacer, or the \xa0guard running the pick and roll with two elite spacers and a great secondary playmaker in Green as the roll man is also another wrinkle that can be worked into the offense.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIn conclusion, I think D’Angelo will fit nicely along with the Warriors future plans and the trades being offered now are not at all worth a \xa024 year old PG with so much potential. He fits well in the offensive system and has the pieces needed to elevate his defense to the level needed as well. He has become a deadly off ball player and it will be exciting to see the future with the three guard lineups. Even with a mediocre to average defense, I can see their offense setting record numbers and winning them a lot of games.\n\n\nAll stats were gathered from NBA stats, basketball reference, and cleaning the glass.', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a long time lurker on &lt;a href=""/r/nba""&gt;r/nba&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to contribute with an in-depth analysis on one of my favorite players in the league. Given the talk about trade offers and packages surrounding D’lo, I thought now was a good time to post this. D’Angelo Russell has been one of my favorite players since he was drafted in 2015 with the 2nd pick. As a Warriors fan since the 2008 We Believe team with my East team being the Nets, I’ve been lucky enough to watch a lot of highly skilled players play for both of my teams. I believe D’Angelo Russell is underrated by the general fanbase of both Warriors and NBA as a whole and I’ve included a variety of \xa0strengths, weaknesses, misconceptions, and highlights to back my argument. I’ve also included a deeper look into the advanced stats and the picture of the player that D’Angelo has the potential to become.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elite Vision:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start with his vision.\xa0D’Angelo Russell is one of the best passers in the league and there aren’t many players I would put above him in terms of court vision. He can make almost any type of pass and he is very creative with his passing. Let’s break down what makes him elite.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Starting with &lt;a href=""https://streamable.com/yfxar""&gt;transition...&lt;/a&gt; D’Angelo Russell is great in transition. He takes his time and always seems to have a mental picture of how players are coming down the floor. He will slow down and make the right passes in delayed transition to streaking bigs, or he’ll whip a no look pass to the player cutting backdoor as he pulls the defensive attention. Even when he doesn’t actively push the pace with his handles, his outlets are sharp and accurate and delivered with a surprising zip behind them - keeping it flashy often both with look offs and no looks. He’ll also drop it off or leave it for the trailer when appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When holding the ball early in the shot clock, D’Lo doesn’t dictate how he wants the offense to set up too often. He carefully surveys the floor and will make &lt;a href=""https://streamable.com/z3cal""&gt;quick, early passes&lt;/a&gt; when his teammates pick up a sliver of an advantage. He is great at finding these tight windows and seeing his teammates open. Playing with a guard like this encourages the whole team to cut hard knowing you’ll be hit when you’re open. He is also great at finding shooters. &lt;a href=""https://streamable.com/8u70o""&gt;Imagine if these passes are going to Curry and Klay&lt;/a&gt;. He is unselfish and many times will have the touch swing pass to the open shooter so quickly the ball is almost never in his hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That brings me to my next point - D’Angelo is one of the best guards in the league at hitting teammates &lt;strong&gt;in stride&lt;/strong&gt; and in the perfect window on cuts… &lt;a href=""https://streamable.com/i2je9""&gt;in addition to throwing the defenders off with where his eyes are looking.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you caught the end of the last GIF, then you’ll know what’s coming next. D’Angelo Russell is &lt;strong&gt;THE BEST&lt;/strong&gt; lob passer in the NBA today. &lt;a href=""https://streamable.com/gr41j""&gt;He’s got every lob in the book&lt;/a&gt;, and he’s showing out with lob targets like WCS, Paschall, Burks, GR3, Green, and Chriss. He can pass both directions with either hand; he can pass across his body with his off arm and opposite his momentum; he can hit oop targets from half court and look them off; he can alleyoop under hand on the drive, chest passes from 30 feet; he is so deadly with the pull-up 3 that bigs need to slightly hedge the screen and if the big slips and the defense is a step late, D’Lo will have already fired a pass for a dunker. He can get to the midrange and put his defender in jail, draw the help who are playing against his floater, and lob a soft pass over their arms. He will throw alley oops in transition if someone is a step late to streaking bigs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However his best pass isn’t his lob - I would say it’s his &lt;a href=""https://streamable.com/lcxly""&gt;pocket pass to rollers in the PnR.&lt;/a&gt; If you were familiar with D’Lo in college, you might remember &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JofVWECgfU""&gt;this clip.&lt;/a&gt; He is a wizard with bounce passing and splitting defenders. It is almost surgical the way he repositions and resets screens until the angle is just right for him to rifle a pass between someones legs for an easy dunk. Harden is another great pocket passer but one thing that D’Angelo clearly has over him - the comfort of using either hand, and passing either direction. His pocket passes are a thing of beauty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measurables/Athleticism:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here\xa0are some of the measurables that we can compare to the average NBA guard. According to DraftExpress, the average height of a guard for both SG and PG is about 6’4 with shoes. The average wingspan is 6’7 and average max vertical is 36.4&amp;quot;. D’Angelo Russell is above average in all measurables. He stands at 6’5 with shoes with a measured wingspan of 6’9.75. This wingspan was measured at age 19, and judging by some pictures I would not be surprised if this has grown to \xa06’10 or even 6’11. The usual age for wingspan to stop growing is around 21 or 22 for males. His max vertical at the combine was 39&amp;quot;. I am sure that this number is shocking to some as Russell is not known as an athletic player, but here are some names around the NBA known for their athleticism with similar vertical numbers at the combine:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;John Wall - 39&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Andre Iguodala - 34.5&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jimmy Butler - 39&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Russell Westbrook - 36.5&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Blake Griffin - 35.5&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is &lt;a href=""https://streamable.com/2k6f0""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; what an &lt;a href=""https://streamable.com/i804f""&gt;unathletic&lt;/a&gt; guard &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/EgJSCn9""&gt;looks&lt;/a&gt; like?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not arguing that D&amp;#39;Angelo is athletic in comparison to other NBA guards. I am acutely aware that max vertical is not what we see in a high level basketball game and it’s rare to be able to elevate to your max in a competitive environment. I am also aware that D’Angelo rarely shows off his athleticism. However, I believe this is a deliberate,\xa0stylistic choice in how he chooses to play the game and utilize his strengths. He is almost always in control both with and without the ball. He is always very careful in setting up his positioning in the half court and will take his time to reposition screens to use them to their highest effectiveness. In this way, he reminds me of James Harden who also doesn’t explode off your computer screen with his athleticism although it’s clear that they both possess it. Another part of athleticism that is not as easy to see is deceleration. D’Angelo has elite deceleration and can stop on a dime and get into a jump shot as &lt;a href=""https://streamable.com/h1ikn""&gt;smoothly&lt;/a&gt; as anyone else in the league. Seriously, check out how tough that shot is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\xa0The main two things I see missing in terms of athleticism are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slow lateral movement making it easy for other guards to blow past him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of a quick,\xa0explosive first step to allow him to blow by his defender easily. More on this later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2019/20 Season Advanced Stats and Changes Adjusting to the Warriors Offensive System:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the 2019/20 season, D’Angelo Russell will be &lt;strong&gt;24 years old&lt;/strong&gt; in his fifth season. His averages on this season are &lt;strong&gt;24/3.6/6.3/1&lt;/strong&gt; in 32 mpg.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a D’Angelo Russell fan, I knew his game came with a lot of pull-up jumpers and was heavily reliant on his pick and roll threat to get to most of his spots. I believed he would not be able to contribute off ball as much as he already has this season and thought it’d take much more time to get accustomed to the Warriors brand of basketball. Through 30 games for the Warriors this year, I no longer hold this bias and I am getting increasingly excited to watch him to play alongside Klay and Curry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some key areas of improvement over last seasons All Star berth:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increase in &lt;strong&gt;FTA&lt;/strong&gt; from 2.5 to &lt;strong&gt;4.4&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a key increase that is necessary in increasing efficiency and becoming a star guard in the league. The top guards all are able to draw FT at a respectable rate and he has more than doubled this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shooting &lt;strong&gt;72% at the rim&lt;/strong&gt; with cuts off the ball and &lt;a href=""https://streamable.com/a8b5x""&gt;crafty finishes like this&lt;/a&gt;. This is the 100th percentile for guards and could be a bit of a fluke. When he gets to the rim this season he has been elite at finishing. However, it’s a career low attempts at the rim. Only 8% of his attempts are within 4 feet of the basket. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lowering &lt;strong&gt;TOV%&lt;/strong&gt; every year since entering the league, down to a &lt;strong&gt;career low 11.8%&lt;/strong&gt; from 15.6%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;D’Angelo is shooting &lt;strong&gt;51% from long mid-range&lt;/strong&gt; classified as 14 feet out to inside the 3 point line. This is in the 91st percentile in efficiency and when taking into account the volume of midranges that D’Angelo takes, \xa0he can only be compared to &lt;strong&gt;Chris Paul&lt;/strong&gt; who’s also having an amazing season from midrange.\xa0As a reference, &lt;strong&gt;Kevin Durant&lt;/strong&gt; shot 51%, 49%, and 54% (WOW) from the \xa0same distance in his 3 years with the Warriors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increase in 3P% from 36.9% on 7.8 attempts per game last year to &lt;strong&gt;38.3% on 9.4 attempts per game&lt;/strong&gt; this year. This is an increase in efficiency and also volume! Breaking down the 3P% leads to even more interesting improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When D’Lo is &lt;a href=""https://streamable.com/pexqy""&gt;coming off a screen&lt;/a&gt;, the Warriors are scoring at &lt;strong&gt;1.11 PPP&lt;/strong&gt;. He attempts 2.9 shots a game off of this type of shot. For context, Paul George leads the league at 3.8 and D’Lo’s similar company in attempts would be &lt;strong&gt;Buddy Hield&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Joe Harris&lt;/strong&gt;, and other shooters known for their off ball tendencies. The efficiency can be compared to &lt;strong&gt;Paul George&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;JJ Redick&lt;/strong&gt; at 1.12 and 1.14PPP respectively. Compare this to last year at 0.83 PPP on 0.7 attempts per game, it’s a huge bump in efficiency and scoring while more than quadrupling the attempts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For contextual reference for all further PPP stats - in the 2019/2020 season, the Mavericks are leading the league with 1.16 PPP, Bucks are second with 1.14 PPP. League average is at 1.09 PPP.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;spot up&lt;/strong&gt; situations, his ability to function as an off ball player is even more apparent as it rises to a &lt;strong&gt;1.30 PPP - in the 95th percentile amongst other elite shooters&lt;/strong&gt;. \xa0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;D’Angelo Russell shot 39.4% on &lt;strong&gt;catch and shoot&lt;/strong&gt; 3’s the previous year. The number of attempts was 3.3 per game. That number has skyrocketed to a flaming &lt;strong&gt;42.4% on 4.1 attempts per game&lt;/strong&gt;. Here are some samples of what these catch and shoot 3’s &lt;a href=""https://streamable.com/pexqy""&gt;look like&lt;/a&gt;. These are not normal difficulty catch and shoots. These are &lt;strong&gt;difficult&lt;/strong&gt; catch and shoots that are shots created through off-ball movement and threat to shoot. The sets are similar to the ones used to set up Klay and Curry for off ball shots and are coming full sprint to turn and square in the air and shoot while the defender is trailing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isolation&lt;/strong&gt; shots: Similar attempts per game at &lt;strong&gt;2.3&lt;/strong&gt; to other offensive stars like Paul George, Trae Young, Bradley Beal, and Devin Booker. He scores at &lt;strong&gt;1.03 PPP&lt;/strong&gt; in these situations similar with players like &lt;strong&gt;Kawhi Leonard&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Trae Young&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Luka Doncic&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Kyrie Irving&lt;/strong&gt;. The ability to create a shot with a live dribble is always essential to a lineups offensive potential and also is a great bailout shot when you aren’t able to get to what you want. He’s shooting &lt;strong&gt;36% \xa0on pull up 3’s at 5.4 a game&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offensive Team Impact:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;\xa0&lt;strong&gt;93rd percentile in assist percentage&lt;/strong&gt; - this is \xa0the percentage of shots he assists teammates on while on the floor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When D’Lo is on the court, he &lt;strong&gt;increases the Warriors eFG% by 4.6%&lt;/strong&gt;! This is 97th percentile in the NBA. Yes, this can be attributed to the fact that his backup is probably not at an NBA level. It is still a huge increase. He also increases the number of 3’s shot \xa0at a +6% frequency, which is in the 95th percentile. For someone with his \xa0shot profile ( a lot of midrange shots), you would expect the team to shoot more midrange when he’s on the floor. This is the opposite, the team shoots 2% less midrange and 6% more from 3 because of the shots he is able to generate for teammates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team shot accuracy at the rim +7.0% - 97th percentile&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team shot accuracy at short midrange +7.7% - 94th percentile&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team shot accuracy at long midrange +7.9% - 90th percentile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team shot accuracy at all midrange +7.6% - 98th percentile&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are not fluky numbers, these percentage increase and percentiles show similar improvements over the last 4 years of his career.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His offensive BPM (OBPM) is at 5.1 this year which would put him 11th in the league. This stat is a good indicator of offensive prowess as we can note from the top 10 that they are all cornerstone pieces in the elite offenses in the NBA. This stat puts him significantly ahead of players like Butler, Anthony Davis, and Lowry while being on par with Jokic, Kemba, and Beal on offensive contribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has the &lt;a href=""https://streamable.com/2gqtp""&gt;clutch gene&lt;/a&gt;.

The degree of difficulty of a lot of his shots is extremely tough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, he has a &lt;a href=""https://streamable.com/ovai4""&gt;great pump fake&lt;/a&gt; that allows him to lose the man closing out on him and relocate to an open three pointer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of &lt;a href=""https://streamable.com/29heq""&gt;relocation&lt;/a&gt;, D’Angelo has learned from Steph Curry the art of relocation after driving and using off ball movement to get the ball back for open shots that were generated from his initial drives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has the ability to catch fire and carry an offense for quarters at a time.

His inability to fight through is apparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;D’Angelo is &lt;a href=""https://streamable.com/k2za8""&gt;unable to catch up laterally with the first step and is never able to position himself between the offensive player and the rim leading to an easy layup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;D’Angelo is &lt;a href=""https://streamable.com/is4rm""&gt;not hustling&lt;/a&gt;, either in transition not sprinting back or just looking lethargic in closeouts. He even makes Joe Ingles look nimble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, his insanely low DRTG can be attributed to hot shooting by the man he \xa0is guarding. Opponents are shooting 44% from 3 against Russell - almost 8% points better than their average.\xa0 I’m sure it can be \xa0partially attributed t o Russell’s \xa0poor defense and lack of hustle, but \xa0at \xa0such an \xa0outlier, \xa0it’s clear that \xa0luck is also \xa0playing \xa0a big part in bringing down his defensive numbers. In his two years in Brooklyn, he did alright defending the perimeter, \xa0but like the eye test suggests, he was horrible at stopping players from scoring at the rim and showed an inability to stay between them and the basket.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were a few positives I noticed from Russell’s defense as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://streamable.com/8c38u""&gt;In this clip&lt;/a&gt;, \xa0D’Lo sees Green fall for the pump fake. As Chriss rotates as the primary help, he leaves behind Tristan Thompson wide open for the dump off. D’Lo sees this so he takes two quick steps to box out Tristan, leaving his man open in the corner but taking \xa0away the wide open dunk. He then recovers to his man for an OK contest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://streamable.com/0wfhk""&gt;In this clip&lt;/a&gt;, Myles Turner has sealed his man and is wide open for the lob pass for an easy two.\xa0 D’Angelo spots this and stunts hard towards Turner, taking away the initial pass. He then sees his man get swung the ball and attempts to deflect it out but misses and gets scored on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although he gets scored on in both clips, they both showed a defensive IQ and awareness to take away the highest percentage look. What’s missing is the hustle required to turn these smart plays into stops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://streamable.com/idjtr""&gt;Some more positives here&lt;/a&gt;. Russell has great wingspan and a good percentage of his steals are from surprising the other team with his reach, getting deflections and steals that \xa0seem unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://streamable.com/76y76""&gt;He also shows good defensive timing&lt;/a&gt; akin to Andre Iguodala when he’s able to position well and contest drives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Areas of Improvement:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are several areas of improvement that need to happen for D’Lo to take the next step&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Biggest Weaknesses:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Slow \xa0lateral movement, easily blown by - hopefully with his decrease in usage, he is able to use more energy on defense and live up to his potential on that end. He has been in the top USG% in the NBA the past 4 years. Additionally, hopefully playing for a winning team with a winning culture will help him realize what kinds of hustle plays are expected day in and day out of the 82 \xa0game season. He’s still early enough in his career to be able to make a \xa0drastic change on that end. He has been at the top of the Nets in deflections and loose balls controlled and I want to see him bring that same hustle here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Labeled as a chucker - I believe that his shot profile will change dramatically after adding back Steph and Klay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://streamable.com/xkgv4""&gt;Careless turnovers&lt;/a&gt; - This reminds me of Steph Curry but there is a tradeoff in creativity, passing, and freedom on the court that will result \xa0in silly turnovers at bad times. This has to be cleaned up similar to how Curry had forced himself out of \xa0those bad habits earlier in \xa0his \xa0career. Remember those bets with Mama Curry? Some of that would be great here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not a good FT shooter - for how amazing a shooter D’Lo is, he doesn’t have \xa0that same consistency at the line&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shot a career low in the short mid-range from 4-14 feet. In 4 years before GSW, he shot 45%. This year it’s down to 38%. I think this is an anomaly that will bounce back given D’Angelo’s &lt;a href=""https://streamable.com/qvzhe""&gt;great and varied floater game&lt;/a&gt;.\xa0 He really demonstrates nice touch on these floaters and they’ve been a staple of his offensive game since he joined the league.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can he work in a system with Steph and Klay and Green?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine D’Angelo as the trigger man at the top of the key, with Steph and Klay coming off of down screens on either wing. Any wrong action by the defense (over playing \xa0the shot if Curry or Klay get a step) can result in a lob \xa0pass for a dunk to the screener or hitting two of the best shooters in the game for a catch and shoot. Now also imagine D’lo being one of the shooters coming off of the down screen and getting swung the ball with the options to shoot, pass, or drive. He’s already shown in just 1/3 of \xa0the season that he is able to contribute as both an off ball player and a ball distributor in Kerr’s system. Adding the pick and roll with D’Angelo as a floor spacer, or the \xa0guard running the pick and roll with two elite spacers and a great secondary playmaker in Green as the roll man is also another wrinkle that can be worked into the offense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I think D’Angelo will fit nicely along with the Warriors future plans and the trades being offered now are not at all worth a \xa024 year old PG with so much potential. He fits well in the offensive system and has the pieces needed to elevate his defense to the level needed as well. He has become a deadly off ball player and it will be exciting to see the future with the three guard lineups. Even with a mediocre to average defense, I can see their offense setting record numbers and winning them a lot of games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All stats were gathered from NBA stats, basketball reference, and cleaning the glass.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'nba', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2qo4s', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/nba', 'subreddit_subscribers': 3041581, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': None, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'thumbnail_height': None, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'title': ""[OC] - In Depth Analysis of D'Angelo Russell - a look at film and advanced stats"", 'total_awards_received': 0, 'ups': 15, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/eyskn2/oc_in_depth_analysis_of_dangelo_russell_a_look_at/', 'user_reports': [], 'view_count': None, 'visited': False, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}]",link,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'm7YnbcTcz69HoI0sCnBBrXT0MLFr9mmjdiKVN2vIp_o', 'resolutions': [{'height': 56, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Xg86Rjnom4Cf7-UE_XpGoEg1l5cFtnLEV4g8SkucAs8.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87e1c8507ab84f8f04180a4490bf8e8da30607ed', 'width': 108}, {'height': 113, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Xg86Rjnom4Cf7-UE_XpGoEg1l5cFtnLEV4g8SkucAs8.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fad135d11b85460560c498973284c7b845c447c', 'width': 216}, {'height': 168, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Xg86Rjnom4Cf7-UE_XpGoEg1l5cFtnLEV4g8SkucAs8.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c7cda24420a91a3b7c153fca01c1fe45d4311bd', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 315, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Xg86Rjnom4Cf7-UE_XpGoEg1l5cFtnLEV4g8SkucAs8.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=b5fcd796809f3513dd0205358f4b81bf421b80b7', 'width': 600}, 'variants': {}}]}",,

   I think GS is still a good chance for him to succeed and I think if he can just keep working on his off-ball game on offense and defense, he can prove that. But I get the fit there is not great. 

  But everyone keeps saying the Wolves or Knicks, but I really think the best fit for him is the Magic. I think people will think the Fultz and D lo paring won't work, but I think he will be fine. For one, tis year he is playing with guys like Paschall and Burks who are score first players and D lo has worked well with them. if D lo pairs with Fultz, I think D lo, who has added some off-ball movements n offense can work with Fultz. It also seems Fultz isn't a total scoring PG so Fultz has the ability to work off ball.


  There are other options like the Pistons or maybe Suns fmo, but I think the Magic with the lack of media coverage, decent young talent, and less pressure would be the best fit for D lo.

A player like Devin Booker is most definitely an all star caliber player, and his stats reflect that, but when almost every team has a player who is averaging 25 PPG, you have to look at that team's success to judge whether its star player is truly an all star.

Obviously there are some exceptions (Brandon Ingram and Trae Young jumps out at me) where the team has not found success, but I don't really think it should be debatable if Booker should make the all star team over Mitchell, who has likely led his team to a comfortable spot in the playoffs, despite averaging a few less points.

The one time period we *know* was quite weak was the 70's before the NBA-ABA merger in the summer of 1976, since there was so much talent going to the ABA, the league expanded too quickly so the available talent was *really* diluted, and there were just too many bizarrely strong/weak teams and guys doing great well into their 30's despite obviously losing athleticism. It was a really weak time for the NBA, so knowing this was helpful in figuring out how to locate other ""questionable"" eras by trying to quantify ways the league was weak in the early/mid-70's. 

I noticed a couple things happening in the NBA during the ABA years that stood out as symptomatic of a weak era: 1) a lot of guys with very short peaks who were in a couple All-Star Games but were never heard from again, and 2) a lot of legit but older talent (*guys in their 30's*) who stayed far more relevant than you'd expect (*Bill Simmons talks about this at length in his book when discussing Lenny Wilkens who somehow peaked from ages 30-35 during the ABA years*). Both of these things indicate a lack of talent consistently developing during the prime peak years for players, right around 24-30.

I turned to Vishaal Agartha ([link to his hoops analytics projects](https://vishaalagartha.github.io/projects/)), an analytics enthusiast who knows how to scrape data &amp; display the results in cool/meaningful ways. I cannot give Vishaal enough credit for all his help pulling &amp; displaying this data while I asked a million questions -- go check his page out; he's great! He created these graphs which display ASG data for every season; **the one shows the age of every player in the ASG** (*plus an all-time average line in red*), **and one that shows the number of career ASG's played in by everyone in that year's ASG** (*to help determine consistency in greatness among an era's players*).

[Distribution of All-Star Appearances](https://i.imgur.com/LBT6ZuR.png) (*ex: the one 16 that shows up throughout the 70's/80's is Kareem*)

Trends are meaningful and/or significant if they appear over multiple years in a row, so I looked for patterns across the charts. Here are a few things that stood out:

**1)** The ABA/70's era consistently had a ton of guys making just a couple ASG's (above average), but this trend chilled itself out by the early-80's. A lot of guys like Flynn Robinson, Geoff Petrie, Jack Marin, and Brian Winters (*a starter in the '76 ASG*) popping in and out of relevance during this time, since *someone* has to fill the ASG rosters. 

**2)** The 90's had a very clear ""olden-ing"" of talent, with a disproportionate amount of guys in their 30's (*and mid-30's at that*) playing in lots of All-Star Games, and a dearth of players in those prime years making it. I've discussed before how the 90's lost a lot of peak-years talent due to the contracts guys were getting right before the Rookie Salary Scale, a few key deaths (Drazen, Lewis, etc), and an unbelievable amount of talented PG's having their careers shortened ([link](https://old.reddit.com/r/VintageNBA/comments/dhetqv/1990s_overview/)). This graph confirms this, plus the ASG Appearances graphs in the 90's have some oddly high low-end spikes.

**3)** Most of the age distribution charts from 2010-now are ""properly"" distributed around the logical center, and most people talk about this past decade as the NBA's recent Golden Age, so this seems to make sense. This is similar for most of the 80's into the early-90's, another era often discussed as having Golden Age-type talent all peaking. The 80's also had very even distributions on the ASG Appearances chart. 

That's a couple initial things that stood out to me. **What else do you glean from the charts?**",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,77055,public,self,What All-Star Game data can tell us about the relative strength of different eras,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/eyhqb3/what_allstar_game_data_can_tell_us_about_the/,,,,,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'cI3vmox7SmDp3ofktFkQWefBSlIhaeMWoBa7azvF1q4', 'resolutions': [{'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/7aas0WBTci5LhNP4TGswAvbWwdjqFsYn-PJ5WFfc7vs.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=064352efcdb444b89cd832b9fc2dcfd0d5eb9cf2', 'width': 108}, {'height': 216, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/7aas0WBTci5LhNP4TGswAvbWwdjqFsYn-PJ5WFfc7vs.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55973a688b2c7a9336a20c9cf2bb2098ec00cf59', 'width': 216}, {'height': 320, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/7aas0WBTci5LhNP4TGswAvbWwdjqFsYn-PJ5WFfc7vs.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39aef2c9b17c6c08ca1b953bd81941893243bf22', 'width': 320}, {'height': 640, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/7aas0WBTci5LhNP4TGswAvbWwdjqFsYn-PJ5WFfc7vs.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cee83c4ba44f20cb06abe3c337151d81709a2d41', 'width': 640}, {'height': 960, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/7aas0WBTci5LhNP4TGswAvbWwdjqFsYn-PJ5WFfc7vs.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7faad61ef0ae29a93f2e704a6f617bf61e753e1c', 'width': 960}, {'height': 1080, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/7aas0WBTci5LhNP4TGswAvbWwdjqFsYn-PJ5WFfc7vs.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fed497ecf1053e0de4f2b38e1aa45ed59581293d', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 3600, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/7aas0WBTci5LhNP4TGswAvbWwdjqFsYn-PJ5WFfc7vs.png?auto=webp&amp;s=801ac8863a6d4501762ca21d12d168c32cde0f71', 'width': 3600}, 'variants': {}}]}",,

Provide your reasoning at the time, and why that take has turned out to be correct or accurate in some way. 

Then tell us your worst take, again providing the reasoning, and admitting where you went wrong. Here's my answers. 

\*\*My Best Take\*\*

I told everyone I knew, on the Internet and IRL, that Trae Young was destined to be a superstar. At the time, there was a lot of chatter to the effect of: ""He's not Steph Curry. Steph is one in a million."" Of course, they were right to some extent. Trae Young is not as good as Steph Curry, and likely never will be. 

However, the argument I made at the time was that Trae possessed enough \*components\* of Steph Curry's greatness to still be a superstar in the NBA. The analogy I thought of at the time was Ben Simmons and Lebron. Ben Simmons isn't Lebron and he never will be. But Simmons possessed the athleticism, court vision, and defensive capability of mid-career Lebron. Those components alone have propelled him to top-25 status in the NBA. 

Trae took historically difficult 3 point shots in college and made a bunch of them. He also displayed A+ passing vision, and his touch suggested that he could develop his floater game to a high level. He didn't look like Jimmer out there, either. He had (and has) a knack for wiggling into and out of weird, in-between spots on the court that most players don't operate from. 

Those are Steph Curry-esque components, or *traits*, and they have served him well in the NBA. Now, he will have to become passable defensively to reach superstar status. But I think he is already an offensive superstar. I think he is making guys like Reddish / Jabari / Len look much better than they are because he alone can sustain a league average offense. He bends the defense in absurd ways. 

He is currently averaging 30-9-5 on 59% True Shooting with miserable talent around him. He shoots too much and is horrific on defense. But this is what it looks like when a superstar is born, and I cannot wait to see him grow into a fully matured player. 

He isn't as stout as Curry, his shooting is worse, and he isn't as good at finishing right at the rim. But he has enough Curry in him--plus better passing--to be a superstar in this league, and that is why I think it was my best take. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*My Worst Take\*\*

I thought Tyreke Evans was going to be a superstar after his rookie year. His counting stats were extremely impressive, and the media loved him. 2009-2010 was exactly one decade ago, but it feels like a million years have passed in terms of my grasp/analysis of the NBA, especially in regards to talent evaluation. 

In retrospect, his statistical profile had all sorts of red flags. He was only at 52% true shooting, couldn't shoot threes, had a high usage, and played on a structure-less bad team that allowed him to put up numbers because they had no one else. 

Late in his career he developed the three pointer and had a brief renaissance, but as a Bill James reader I should have recognized the difference between empty stats and important stats. Stats on a bad team are NOT inherently empty--see Devin Booker, Trae Young, and Luka last year--but Tyreke was doing very little to advance his team's chances of winning basketball games (""very little"" is relative to the general perception of his performance). 

I have had many other bad takes, I'm sure, but your brain has a strange ability to erase the bad ones and remember the good ones loud and clear.

For posterity, here's some takes that I'll check in on next season: 

**Kevin Porter Jr. will be a better NBA player than both Collin Sexton and Darius Garland.** 

**Andre Drummond will not provide significant value to the team he is traded to.** 

**The Ben McLemore renaissance is for real.**",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,77025,public,self,My Best Take and My Worst Take (Let's hear yours),0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/eyd5u2/my_best_take_and_my_worst_take_lets_hear_yours/,,,,,,,,,,,

It's why when looking at a specific trade, signing, or team combination I typically hold my breath until consistency begins to form; this doesn't exclude individual performances. 

***The first major surprise for me*** was the performance of Luka Doncic. His rookie season was definitely awesome, I had no doubts that he was going to be a great player. However, as we're nearing the All-Star Break, I'm a little unsure of what we're witnessing. So far, he's averaging 28.8 PPG, 8.7 APG, and 9.5 RPG at the age of 20 years old. The Mavs are currently 30-19, good enough for 6th in the west. The Mavs aren't an awful team; however, from watching this team perform, Luka has a wild gravity that propels the time to overachievement. Since I've been watching Luka this season, I'm becoming more and more bewildered about the potential of this young player. 

***Next on my list*** is a rather negative one: Mike Conley. So far, he's averaging 12.9 PPG, 4.1 APG, and 3.0 RPG. For only the second time in his career since 2008 (his rookie year), he's not averaging a steal. His minutes have been reduced as he is no longer starting. With that being said, his shooting splits have not been great. On the season, he's shooting 38.2% from the field and 34.8% from the three. Now, there is still a chance that he picks up his play and finds a fitting role. However, for his massive 32M contract, it's not looking fruitful thus far. Despite this downfall, the Utah Jazz are, surprisingly, 4th in the west with a 32-17 record. They're still doing fine, which is nice to see. 

***I also have to discuss my favorite team, the Sixers.*** So far, I'm conflicted on whether or not to be excited about this team Elton Brand has built. On paper, it still looks like the best team in the league, in my opinion. Over the summer, many fans, including myself, bought into the hype as most major power-ranking websites had Philly as a top-5 team in the league. However, this has been far from the case. When the Sixers are able to score baskets, they're very challenging to beat. But that's the key point: scoring baskets is sometimes difficult. I've watched almost every game this season and countless times I've seen the offense come to a screeching halt. No intelligent ball movement, seemingly no effort, unresolved turnover issues, and just not hitting shots. A lot of Sixers fans still believe that the team still has a major shot at the title. I'm just not sure this is the case if the team continues to be incredibly streaky. It's also difficult to find something or someone to point the finger at as it's just a weird fit all around. They're a playoff team, but the hype was too high. 

***Some other things to note,*** I love the Grizzlies' success thus far. They're still a young team undoubtedly. However, they've set themselves up for success in the future. I mean hell, they're even getting mass-media attention, something that has evaded the small-market Memphis team for a while. With Ja, JJJ, Clarke, Brooks, and JV, they're actually a really fun team to watch. As of recent, watching Lillard have a historical run has been shocking. He's always been excellent, but in the back of my mind I wonder if he's budding into something that no one has predicted: a future MVP candidate (if the Blazers figure it out).

Conversations with others confirmed that he never had any regrets about not fathering a son. But he was America’s son, and that’s as difficult to deny in conversation as he was to defend on the court. Although there was no defense for some of his actions as a young man, his is an all-American story of public rise, ruin, and eventually redemption.  

Growing up as a member of an athletic ex-pat family in Italy, Kobe was obsessively driven by the notion of being an outcast. Unable to fluently speak the language or identify with many of his peers, he was often the only African American in his circles. In a conversation with Shaquille O’Neal, Kobe suggested that this notion of being alienated fueled his hunger for success on the basketball court. So how does this fit into the image of an American?

America is and always was a nation of outcasts-religious freedom seekers, sons and daughters of liberty, prospectors, outlaws, punk rockers, protestors, marchers, conscientious objectors, rejected inventors, college dropouts, entrepreneurs, dreamers. We are a nation built from the bricks of visions laid by the sore hands of those with enough courage and conviction to strap on their boots and walk the, narrow, lonely, and often obstructed path to success. 

We all grew with Kobe, from his supremely talented but brash teenage years in the suburbs of Pennsylvania, to his promising early seasons as a Laker, to his global superstardom and championships with Shaq, to his fall in the face of rape allegations, and finally to his rise from the ashes of a smoldering public image to become the black mamba, to coil around championship trophies again. We’ve seen him as dunker, scorer, leader, rapper, feuder, writer, teacher, husband, and father. His wife extended him a second chance after he went astray, and it seems like most of America offered a similar forgiveness.

Kobe showed us that hard work was the compass that guided him along that path. He told us that the American dream is the journey itself, and all of the work and personal sacrifice it entails, not the destination. The time that many of us devote to being friends or being social was time that Kobe just wasn’t willing to give in his career. He lived in the gym, once declining Allen Iverson’s club invite after a dinner they shared following a game in Los Angeles during their shared rookie year.

When talking with Ahmad Rashad in 2015 about his thought process before winning that all important championship without the shadow of Shaq looming over him, Kobe offered us a glimpse of the relentless competitive motor constantly cranking inside of him: “Understand that the time is going to come. Why? Because I’m going to keep banging on this door until it comes.” He emphasized each word in the last sentence, pounding his fist into his hand in rhythm with his speech for added effect. A will is enough to make a way, even when the way is blocked.

Unlike so many celebrities, his death carries no asterisk: no self inflicted wound, no speeding, no alcohol poisoning, no drug overdoses, no downward spiral. If anything, Kobe was spiraling upwards as an entrepreneur, husband, father and man. The loss of him, his daughter, and seven others is literally earth shattering in ways that many of us have never felt before. 

William Butler Yeats once wrote that, “Things fall apart, the centre cannot hold. Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.” Things did fall apart on that fateful Sunday morning. The man who offered a superhuman reel of achievements reminded us of our own mortality. But contrary to Yeats’ claim, Kobe’s death has brought about not a sense of anarchy and division, but a union of community in all corners of life, from schoolyards, to neighborhoods, to barbershops to office break-rooms.

To some he was a hero, to others a villain, but to all he was a legend, As evidence of his mass appeal and accessibility to all races and demographics, we are all either directly or indirectly affected. We should rest assured that our suffering is widespread and communal, as will be our healing–America coming together in a time of such division.

As a leader, Kobe always wanted to be the best version of himself and for his teammates and family to follow suit. We should follow that example in the wake of his passing—to be those best versions of ourselves in honor of America’s lost son. In his words, “The most important thing is how your life touches those around you and how it carries to the next generation.”",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,76975,public,self,A Kobe Bryant Tribute: The Death of America's Son,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/exov76/a_kobe_bryant_tribute_the_death_of_americas_son/,,,,,,,,,,,

Say a player scores 25 points in the first quarter on 12 of 12 shooting the first quarter then goes 0 for 8 the rest of the game to end up with a statline of 25 points on 12 of 20 shooting.

Now let's imagine the opposite player, that starts the game out 0 for 8 for the first three quarters, then ends up hitting 12 straight buckets in the 4th to end up with a stat line of....25 points on 12 of 20 shooting.

And finally, let's imagine that there's a play that goes 3 for 5 throughout all 4 quarters and ends up scoring 25 points on 12 of 20 shooting.

Though all these scenarios are fairly improbable, they are used to raise the question: should we consider when a player scores a basket when considering their impact? Would you say all three performances are equal in importance? Probably not, so why does the box score ignore these? Practically, it's a bit hard to track, but it seems important.

&amp;#x200B;

I think it's important to remember that if a player takes 12 shots in a row, it probably impacts how ""in the groove"" and thus accurate his teammates are. I've heard counter arguments that all points are counted the same, whether in the first quarter or second, but as we know, basketball is a game of runs.

Imagine you had two games, with Team 1-Team 2, at the following scores

Scenario 2: 0-0, 2-2, 5-5, 7-7, 10-10, 10-10. Do you think both teams have a 50% chance of winning in each of these games?

OTA viewers have options to watch NFL for a full day ( noon until 8 pm) on a sunday while NBA fans are lucky to get 2 games on a typical Saturday.

As you can see, league average FG% is not that different. Teams aren't just bricking out of nowhere. I really have no idea how that post got 300 upvotes. Stay woke people. 

It's also not that different from the offense from a decsde ago. Instead of shooting 3s, they just bricked long 2s instead. 

In fact, 3 pointers is by far the biggest reason for scoring averages going up. Pace, free throws per field goal attempt, and FG% have stayed consistent. It's the sheer volume of 3s that has changed. In addition, more 3s = more spacing, which leads to less contested drives, post ups, and even makes shooting for others easier.

Looking at the way that Kuzma’s and Ingram’s careers seem to have gone in opposite directions, it seems the lakers made a mistake trading Ingram instead of Kuzma. But maybe they didn’t:
Ingram’s success could largely be attributed to a change of location, more shot attempts, and a higher usage rate, things that he wouldn’t have had in LA. He also may have some extra motivation from not being re-signed in the summer despite being eligible. So, would he really have been much better in LA than he was before? He may have just faced the same circumstances as Kuzma (coming off bench, far less touches) and have the same situation that Kuzma is, where he’s now not considered an important part of the team and is on the trade block. 
Looking back about a year ago, the story was that the lakers wanted to keep Kuzma safe from the AD trade. Everyone but him was eligible to be traded. 
Do you think both teams would have agreed to kuzma + others instead of ingram + others? IIRC, the argument was that Ingram has a much higher potential but Kuzma was currently the better player, but I assumed they had comparable trade value, especially considering the narrative that Ingram was a bit of a disappointment.

2. **Missed FTs result in a point being deducted**

3. **FGs scored in the final 3 minutes of the game are worth 8 POINTS**

These rules wouldn’t work in the NBA; it would encourage flopping, even heavier reliance on 3 pointers, and would make the first 45 minutes of the game seem unimportant relative to the final 3.

However, one rule caught my eye, and is something i actually thought was a cool idea

4. **Dunks are worth 3 points, rather than the standard 2**

Many casual fans who say the modern NBA has gotten boring often cite how the higher volume of 3 pointers incentivizes poor shots, and penalizes slashing players like Ben Simmons and RJ Barrett. 

If the NBA chose to institute this, there would be a higher amount of post play, and possibly increase the value of true post-play Centers and slashers.

What do you think? Personally, I feel like this would make the game WAY too reliant on post play, and penalize teams like the Rockets and Warriors who’ve built their whole team around shooters, while also making spacing less important.

The current system is where whatever team has the most point after 4 quarters, unless overtime, wins the game.

The alternate system would be based on matches/sets. Each set can be 10-15min long. Whoever has the most pts at the end of the set wins the match. 1st to win 3 matches wins the game. If theres a draw end of match the a 5 min overtime will be issued. Similar to how volleyball is structure.

I think this method would be a good alternative. Defense will probably be more intense as well as offense, more upsets etc.

Conclusion: Mitchell and Paul are good defenders but they aren’t that much better than booker. Booker is average. Mitchell and Paul are above average.

The real question is does Paul’s defense and added steals on a team with better record provide more value than bookers additional 10 PPG on better shooting.

    The NBA ratings dropped in 1999 and sank to their worst ratings in 18 years by 2004, since then they climbed slowly up to 2010 where they have been basically stable with very little rise or gain for 8 years until last year where they dropped to 2005 levels and are now down another 20% this year. Maybe you are young, but any business that not only shows no gains in their market share with marketing but actually drop 2 consecutive years nobody is dumb enough to argue that the marketing department and media know what they are doing. That is the definition of being bad at your job and gets you fired at 99% of the companies out there. 

    As for the media pivoting on what the public wants, do you really pay that little attention to what is going on? 90% of the country does not give a crap about the KNicks, yet they get more coverage then the top teams in the league, is that because people want to see it? 

    Fact is the media and the NBA have ignored signs for years, they have ignored that their marketing was basically only able to replace the fans that they were losing every year. ESPN has went through 3 years of cuts and changed the upper management largely due to lower ratings throughout their channels. When ESPN came about and grew they were focused on all teams, all highlights, and a lot of sports from throughout the world, over the last 20 years they have began focusing on only large markets and big stars ignoring the other stories. INstead of going back to their roots they have doubled down and are still losing viewers at historical levels. 

    You are right, they are the experts, the experts that have a declining business that has lost a huge percentage of their popularity that they enjoyed 22 years ago. 

    As for your big reasons, let's look at reality instead of your made up reasons. 

    3. the NBA is literally the only sports league in the United States that has declining ratings, even professional wrestling is drawing higher ratings. 

    2. the Ratings were down last year before anybody on the WArriors were injured. 

    1. If Lebron was such a huge factor than why are the west coast games still down in ratings even when they show the Lakers?

Personally I would be all for something similar to what they did in ""The Basketball Tournament"" and its Elam Ending. The Elam ending played the game as usual until the first dead ball with under 4 minutes to go. At that point the target score was set at 8 points higher than the score of the leading team. So if the score was 55-48 the end score would be 63 and the first team to reach that score is the winner.

So whats to like? No more marches to the free throw line to end games. Teams are incentivized to score and prevent the other team from scoring, teams are no longer incentivized to run down the clock. No more OT. In the era of load management and talks of shortening the season this eliminates extending games further than needed. The potential for some crazy comebacks exists. As long as a team can prevent the other from scoring they still have a shot.

Now there are certainly some negatives. No more buzzer beaters. Every game will have a game winning shot, but hard to replace the magic of hitting a shot as time expires. No more OT. While this might be good for players, fans could miss out on some iconic OT moments. Games will end at the free throw line. Just because intentional fouling will decrease doesn't mean fouls won't happen, and you could see some walkoff free throws.

So you can see that basketball was completely different at the beginning of LeBron's career, a lot of assists were in the mid-range, probably the most of those points were scored by Cavaliers legend Zydrunas Ilgauskas, and Varejao also scored a lot from that distance.

Also, I find it even more interesting how different the charts from the 2009-10 and 2014-15 seasons are, a major turn in NBA basketball happened around that period.

Over the years in Miami, his assists have diminished compared to Cleveland's final years, and he even went into the PF role often, which fit him well, those were perhaps the best scoring years for him, he had amazing shot percentage.

And as I said, returning to Cleveland had him see playmaking role again, especially in the last two years at the Cavs. And of course, he has taken that role to an even higher level this year with Lakers.

LeBron is like wine, the older he is, the better, at least when it comes to assisting ...

I need to note I am a Phoenix Suns fan and am still decently upset over Booker being snubbed, but while I was lurking other team snubs in their thoughts on All Star selections, I saw reoccurring comments saying “It’s hard for Booker because Phoenix is a small market” or “Sometimes I forget the Washington Wizards exist (in reference to Beal being snubbed).” I find this extremely odd however because Phoenix is the 5th largest city in the USA, larger than Philadelphia or Dallas for example, and Washington is larger than Boston, Atlanta or Memphis, according to wikipedia’s entry on US cities rank in population (sorry i felt a little lazy in extensive research). Why is this a thought permeating through some NBA fandoms?

There is of course a well documented East Coast bias in all sports coverage by sports fans west of the Mississippi, but I feel it goes deeper than that. I think it’s dependent upon the plugs they get from high level NBA media folk. I find Tim McMahon and Royce Young, both great journalists from what I can tell, get retweeted by Woj pretty often and I think OKC and Dallas resonate more in the minds of national NBA fans. I also find it odd that the Jazz get a lot of national recognition from Zach Lowe and Ryen Russillo but I can’t tell you who has extensively covered Denver. Reporters covering markets that in reality would be considered smaller than others based on population, but are given the large microphone that is the ESPN national platform, creates what I believe is a distortion in the way those look at the West. It also doesn’t help that I imagine most outside Phoenix can’t think of a single high profile media member that has ties to the Suns outside Charles Barkley, but how many sports personalities and reporters with Boston ties can you name off the top of your head? 

I have to acknowledge the Phoenix Suns have not be good this decade which of course plays a part, but at the same time there are other markets that have not been very good for a while either and receive plenty of coverage, for example the Chicago Bulls which Chicago has only 1 million more constituents than Phoenix (sorry bulls fans I love y’all). 

In conclusion, I feel it’s important to end on this: some casual fans just fans of their own teams think Booker plays for a small market or he isn’t a winning player and that idea exists for other players for markets I don’t know as well as Phoenix. What really is terrible about this system though is the media plays such a large part in shaping the narratives what fans believe (and vote on) that with NBA All Star or All NBA teams, players are actually being punished in regards to their legacy, as well as in their pockets, for not being in the markets the media has deemed relevant. Which really sucks as a guy who just likes his team in his city and doesn’t want his city to feel not good enough for good NBA players.

I didn’t cover LA and NY markets because those are the two biggest cities in the US and are separated from the idea I was trying to present, but I hope this causes a positive discussion regarding NBA media coverage and would love to hear thoughts on other NBA markets and whether or not what I said makes sense. :)",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,76883,public,self,"How Media Coverage played into Booker, Beal and other Snubs",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ewsiel/how_media_coverage_played_into_booker_beal_and/,,,ae62087a-f8c0-11e8-a415-0e9f206e00fa,Current Events,,,,,,,

I think he's had a phenomenal season, and is a huge reason why OKC are performing above expectations. His teammates are all having great seasons, and I believe this is directly attributed to the influence CP3 has had on the roster, both on and off the court.

My issue is with the idea that a team firmly established in the playoffs automatically have at least one player selected to the all star team, and Chris Paul was that player this season.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2017 DeAndre Jordan was named an all star, despite barely averaging over 12ppg. Why? Because CP3 and Griffin were injured, and LAC were 4th seed, so DJ automatically got picked because he was the next best player.

In 2018 Goran Dragic was named an all star, despite there being more deserving players. Why? Because Miami were 6th seed, and he was their best healthy player.

Last season Nikola Vucevic was named an all star. You can argue that he deserved it, but I believe that he was only picked because he was the best player on a playoff bound team.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where my problem lies: How can a guy such as Trae Young be starting on the East all star team, despite playing for the worst team in the NBA? He deserves it no doubt, averaging nearly 30p/10a, but the NBA has rewarded players for being playoff teams, yet decides to have a second year player on the worst team start. 

They should either have the criteria solely focused on rewarding winning teams: e.g if you're playing on a lottery team you have no chance to make the all star team, and only pick players from teams that are winning (and hence have earned it). Or, make the teams' record completely irrelevant, and pick players based on popularity and stats.

If Devin Booker and Bradley Beal can't make the all star team despite putting up the ridiculous numbers they are putting up, but Trae Young is starting in the all star game, when his team are last in the east, then there is a serious problem. 

Denver are second in the west and only had one player make the all star team, who barely even made the reserves. Yet Houston gets two all stars despite being an inferior team. The NBA justify the CP3 selection based on ""OKC are a great team and deserve an all star"", but Houston gets more all star selections than Denver?

Something clearly has to change to make it more fair for players on small market teams. Devin Booker would already have 4 all star appearances if he played in LA or NYC.

It’s partly because I’m a Bucks fan, and they underrate them (based on actual outcomes and my opinion). In past years they used a simple Elo model (same as they use for NFL and similar to what’s used for chess rankings). You can still see this version of the model if you click the “show our Elo forecast” button on the top of their rankings page (notice how much ratings change?): https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-nba-predictions/?ex_cid=rrpromo

However, this year they created a new model based on individual player’s ratings. I was kind of intrigued at first – I mean it seems fun and might allow for some more nuanced looks at team’s strengths and weaknesses. In trying to make the model more flexible they eliminated using the best indicator of a team’s actual rating: its record.

The new rating model gives a few different columns to sort by: current rating (rating based off of player’s current availability (if one of your starters is out it will negatively impact this score), full strength rating (assumes all your players are healthy, what I would consider to be their “power ranking”), and a full strength playoff rating (same as before, but increases the minutes of your starters so it’s a bit higher than the regular season full strength rating).

As I mentioned above, I would consider the full strength regular season ranking to be their “power ranking”, and currently it ranks the bucks as the 5th best team behind the Clippers, the 76ers, the Lakers, and the Rockets. If you look a little closer, you’ll also see they have a projected record column that says they expect the Bucks to finish this season with a record of 64-18. To do that they’d need to finish the final 35 games of this season with a record of 23-12 (.657), for a playoff team most years that would be a reasonable expectation. However, they’ve completed the first 47 games of this season with a record of 41-6 (.872), nearly record breaking pace for the winningest season. Their model is complex, so it’s hard to say exactly why it expects the Bucks to do so much worse in the second half of the season, but it doesn’t take too much analysis to see it seems to severely underrate them.

OK, here’s where I tried to compare 538’s model with basketball references SRS (simple rating system: https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020.html), and compared 538’s expected points scored and points allowed to actual points scored and points allowed.

see table here: https://imgur.com/a/S7R5qSj

First of all, I did this all on Monday, the 27th, so if you compare some of the numbers with what’s out there currently it might not match exactly, but it should still be very close.

Here I’ll just describe what each column is, where it comes from, and if relevant how it was calculated:

The first column is just team name

second column is 538 model’s expected points scored/game

the third column is 538’s expected points allowed/game

the fourth column is actual points scored/game (from bbref)

fifth is actual points allowed/game

sixth is BBRef’s SRS rating (the table is sorted by this score high to low),

the seventh is the SRS score normalized (meaning, how many standard deviations (one sd is 5.23 here) away from the mean (0) is the team’s SRS score. As the name suggests, normalizing is a way to compare the same teams across different rating models. 0 means average, 1 means you’re better than about 2/3 of the teams, 2 means elite – like top 5%ish, and the opposite is true -1 means only better than about 1/3, -2 means trash)

eighth is converting the normalized SRS score to 538’s rating system. To do this I found the standardized score (column 7) and multiplied by the standard deviation of 538’s rating (122.8) and added that to the average of 538’s model (1532).

The ninth column is just 538’s “full strength rating” The 10th column is the difference between actual points scored and 538’s predicted points scored (if it’s negative/red it means 538 “underrated” this. If it’s positive/green 538’s model “overrated” it).

11th column is the difference between actual points allowed and 538’s predicted points allowed.

The 12th column is the 10th and 11th column combined.

The 13th column is the 538 rating (column I) minus the SRS converted to 538 rating (column H)

OK, so you can probably see from the red/green shading that the bucks are the most underrated team by 538. They have the best offense in the league and score 119.3 ppg, but 538 “projects” they should only score 116. Their defense is top 10, and only allows 106.7 ppg, but 538 “projects” they should give up 108. Combined 538’s projections underrate the bucks performance by 4.6 points per game, and their new overall team rating is over 100 points under what their actual performance says it should be.

Other interesting things to note: it overrates the 76ers basically by as much as it underrates the bucks. Yes part of this is because the 76ers have had injuries, and the 538 rating is based off of “full strength”, but it’s still a pretty sizable difference between actual performance and 538’s expected performance.

All this is to say, why would you neglect the one concrete indicator of performance (the team’s actual record) in favor of a bunch of hard to decipher advanced statistics?

7 quarters (or periods, whatever) of 8 minutes each (maximum). There's the first tribute with #8.

In each quarter, East or West can win in one of two ways. The first is by reaching 24 points before the quarter is up, which automatically ends the quarter. The second is whichever team has the higher score by the end of the quarter, in case neither reach 24. There's the second tribute with #24.

The game will be played as a best of 7 - the first team to win 4 quarters wins the whole ASG. 

I would also propose that any individual all star can only play a maximum of 5/7 quarters, so there would be some interesting strategy and lineups involved.

Each quarter will result in $50k being given to the winning charity, and the charity of the team that wins it all will get whatever's leftover of the $500k (4-0 sweep = $300k left, 4-3 win = $150k left).",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,76832,public,self,Alternative All-Star Game format suggestion,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ewe4yd/alternative_allstar_game_format_suggestion/,,,,,,,,,,1580426033.0,

He reached his goal of trading up to a house with the fourteenth transaction, trading a movie role for a house in July 2006.* 

It seems that the Lakers are looking to acquire another player that can shoot threes and guard the Clippers' big wings, and Marcus Morris is a name that gets bandied about. The problem, however, is that Marcus Morris makes $15 million this year, and the Lakers would have difficulty getting to the $12 million required to reach the 125% salary match rule without including Danny Green or KCP, which obviously they don't want to do.

Some members of the media — maybe on the Nate Duncan mock trade pod? — have proposed that the Lakers make a trade in tiers, where they start with a package of, say, Quinn Cook ($3M), Demarcus Cousins ($3.5M), and Jared Dudley (just over $2.5M) or Troy Daniels (just over $2M), then make two or even three separate trades for increasingly large salaries to match for Morris while somehow getting the Knicks an asset. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist was a name that they bandied about, since he makes $13M and Charlotte could be looking to cut costs. 

Assume Kuzma (1.974M) is in the deal, either in a separate trade for a minimum Knicks guy since they can't package a guy they traded for, or in one of the original trades in exchange for a pick that they end up sending with the last salary.

It’s partly because I’m a Bucks fan, and they underrate them (based on actual outcomes and my opinion). In past years they used a simple Elo model (same as they use for NFL and similar to what’s used for chess rankings). You can still see this version of the model if you click the “show our Elo forecast” button on the top of their rankings page (notice how much ratings change?): &lt;a href=""https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-nba-predictions/?ex_cid=rrpromo""&gt;https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-nba-predictions/?ex_cid=rrpromo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, this year they created a new model based on individual player’s ratings. I was kind of intrigued at first – I mean it seems fun and might allow for some more nuanced looks at team’s strengths and weaknesses. In trying to make the model more flexible they eliminated using the best indicator of a team’s actual rating: its record. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The new rating model gives a few different columns to sort by: current rating (rating based off of player’s current availability (if one of your starters is out it will negatively impact this score), full strength rating (assumes all your players are healthy, what I would consider to be their “power ranking”), and a full strength playoff rating (same as before, but increases the minutes of your starters so it’s a bit higher than the regular season full strength rating). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, I would consider the full strength regular season ranking to be their “power ranking”, and currently it ranks the bucks as the 5th best team behind the Clippers, the 76ers, the Lakers, and the Rockets. If you look a little closer, you’ll also see they have a projected record column that says they expect the Bucks to finish this season with a record of 64-18. To do that they’d need to finish the final 35 games of this season with a record of 23-12 (.657), for a playoff team most years that would be a reasonable expectation. However, they’ve completed the first 47 games of this season with a record of 41-6 (.872), nearly record breaking pace for the winningest season. Their model is complex, so it’s hard to say exactly why it expects the Bucks to do so much worse in the second half of the season, but it doesn’t take too much analysis to see it seems to severely underrate them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OK, here’s where I tried to compare 538’s model with basketball references SRS (simple rating system: &lt;a href=""https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020.html""&gt;https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020.html&lt;/a&gt;), and compared 538’s expected points scored and points allowed to actual points scored and points allowed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;see table here: &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/S7R5qSj""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/S7R5qSj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First of all, I did this all on Monday, the 27th, so if you compare some of the numbers with what’s out there currently it might not match exactly, but it should still be very close. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here I’ll just describe what each column is, where it comes from, and if relevant how it was calculated: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first column is just team name&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;second column is 538 model’s expected points scored/game &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the third column is 538’s expected points allowed/game&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the fourth column is actual points scored/game (from bbref)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;fifth is actual points allowed/game&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;sixth is BBRef’s SRS rating (the table is sorted by this score high to low), &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the seventh is the SRS score normalized (meaning, how many standard deviations (one sd is 5.23 here) away from the mean (0) is the team’s SRS score. As the name suggests, normalizing is a way to compare the same teams across different rating models. 0 means average, 1 means you’re better than about 2/3 of the teams, 2 means elite – like top 5%ish, and the opposite is true -1 means only better than about 1/3, -2 means trash) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;eighth is converting the normalized SRS score to 538’s rating system. To do this I found the standardized score (column 7) and multiplied by the standard deviation of 538’s rating (122.8) and added that to the average of 538’s model (1532). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ninth column is just 538’s “full strength rating”\nThe 10th column is the difference between actual points scored and 538’s predicted points scored (if it’s negative/red it means 538 “underrated” this. If it’s positive/green 538’s model “overrated” it).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;11th column is the difference between actual points allowed and 538’s predicted points allowed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 12th column is the 10th and 11th column combined.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 13th column is the 538 rating (column I) minus the SRS converted to 538 rating (column H)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OK, so you can probably see from the red/green shading that the bucks are the most underrated team by 538.

## Introduction

Halfway through the season, we start analyzing individual award candidates. In 2020, we have 2 candidates for MVP and DPOY in Giannis Antetokounmpo and Rudy Gobert who look more and more likely to repeat. Yet, detractors say that voters will tend away from these candidates due to voter fatigue. What is voter fatigue and how does much does it affect the individual awards? The goal of this project is to analyze the voter fatigue phenomenon.

---

## Methodology

### Measuring A Candidate's Success
For each award we choose the most relevant statistic that determines the award.

For the MVP, we choose Win Shares (WS) since the MVP should be determined by the
player who contributes most to the team's success.

For DPOY, we choose Defensive Win Shares (DFS) since the DPOY should be
determined by the player who contributes the most to the team's success
*exclusively on the defensive end*.

For MIP, we choose the difference between the player's PER the year they were
selected and the player's PER the year prior.

For SMOY, we choose the player's PER that year.

For COY, we choose the difference between the number of wins the team won that
year and the number of wins the team was predicted to win ([Pythagorean
Wins](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/glossary.html) on Basketball
Reference).

To summarize:

|Award|Metric|
|--|--|
|MVP|WS|
|DPOY|DWS|
|MIP|CURR_PER-PREV_PER|
|SMOY|PER|
|COY|W-PW|

### Measuring A Candidate's Award Voting

For MVP, DPOY, MIP, and SMOY, we aggregate the the share of the points that the
player received during voting from the years 1988 onward since award statistics
were first released in 1988.

Unfortunately, award statistics were only released in 2016 for COY, so our
dataset will be much smaller. 
 
### Computing Voter Fatigue

For each award, we compute the difference between the points share the candidate
received the following year. Next, we compute the difference between the
relevant scaled statistic.

For example:

Michael Jordan won the MVP in 1988 with a WS of 21.2 and a PTS_SHARE of 0.831.
In 1989, he lost to Magic Johnson, with a WS of 19.8 and a PTS_SHARE of 0.704.

So the two data points we compute are 21.2-19.8 = 0.4, and 0.831-0.704=0.127

We then plot the difference in the Points Share as a function of the statistic's
difference and fit a regression line.

Finally, we find the x-intercept of this regression line.

This x-intercept measures how much better the candidate must perform **if they
were to maintain their performance from their previous year AND receive the same
points share**.

Using this value, we can quantify voter fatigue for each award.

---

## Results

For each of the awards, I plotted the difference in PTS_SHARE as a function of the difference in the relevant statistic.

Using `numpy.polyfit` with an order=1, I plotted regression lines for each of the plots to compute the best fit line.

Here are the relevant plots for each award:

[MVP](https://i.imgur.com/vyAU7h5.png) 

[DPOY](https://i.imgur.com/DddmrEt.png) 

[MIP](https://i.imgur.com/GXPXnxu.png) 

Evidently, there is insufficient data to say anything significant about the MIP
award. 

[SMOY](https://i.imgur.com/Auv81vb.png) 

[COY](https://i.imgur.com/bEnvGoe.png) 

Two data points consisting of Steve Kerr and Mike D'Antoni is insufficient, so
we can't really say much about COY. 

---
 
## Summary 
 
Let's take a look at all the best fit lines along with the corresponding
x-intercepts for the awards we *can* say something about (MVP, DPOY, SMOY). 

**MVP**

Best fit line:

y=0.08050905774386342*x+(-0.24492895462768918)

x-intercept: 3.042253399697231

**DPOY**

Best fit line:

y=0.09736020500961524*x+(-0.26654381850154735)

x-intercept: 2.7377080653766455
    
**SMOY**

Best fit line:

y=0.08159692715800439*x+(-0.33335872670259853)

x-intercept: 4.085432360180455

 
# Conclusions and Takeaways 
 
So what does this mean for each of the awards listed above?

**To repeat as MVP, an individual must increase his win shares by ~3.042.**

**To repeat as DPOY, an individual must increase his defensive win shares by
~2.738.**

**To repeat as SMOY, an individual must increase his PER by ~4.085.** 

Unfortunately, the lack of data for the COY and MIP awards renders it difficult to
say anything significant about the awards.
 
Now, not all of these statistics are on the same scale. Of course, Win Shares
and Defensive Win Shares are on a similar scale so we can compare them
relatively easily.

PER, on the other hand, is on a separate scale. However, we can easily eyeball
the scale by comparing the relative PER and WS of top recent candidates.

Consider Giannis Antetokounmpo. His WS is 8.1 PER is 32.7

Consider James Harden. His WS is 8.7 PER is 29.4

Generally, the same pattern holds where a player's PER is approximately 3-4x his
WS. 
 
Evidently, WS and DWS is a metric **signficantly** harder to increase than PER.
So increasing a player's PER by ~4 is signficantly easier than increasing a
player's WS or DWS by ~3.

As a result, we can fairly certainly say that the difficulty to repeat in one of
the three awards (i.e. get the same amount of POINTS_SHARE) it can be ordered in
difficulty as follows:

**1) MVP**

**2) DPOY**

**3) SMOY**

With MVP and DPOY being of similar difficulty, but SMOY being significantly
easier.

We can, thus, conclude that voter fatigue affects the MVP award the most,
followed by DPOY and then SMOY.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,76817,public,self,[OC] Quantifying and Analyzing Voter Fatigue for NBA Individual Awards,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ewa5vf/oc_quantifying_and_analyzing_voter_fatigue_for/,,,,,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'NrN2eNTZAPHqokW0pyVmTOwFT9NjgOAu-PdPdbYI5yE', 'resolutions': [{'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/3ooZF8i7MOzlNJNQxvinBOoBxGi0blRbOPZe80Ul9-E.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab47223007247886d0b70f7832b9c1245123237a', 'width': 108}, {'height': 216, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/3ooZF8i7MOzlNJNQxvinBOoBxGi0blRbOPZe80Ul9-E.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=049433f0022217bc7f397fdb66941f607cce9f56', 'width': 216}, {'height': 320, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/3ooZF8i7MOzlNJNQxvinBOoBxGi0blRbOPZe80Ul9-E.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e256de1c3e9269ca93b7af7e77379b62d3917564', 'width': 320}, {'height': 640, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/3ooZF8i7MOzlNJNQxvinBOoBxGi0blRbOPZe80Ul9-E.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b049eed09f35dde0456fca01f4079f175d0b8c71', 'width': 640}, {'height': 960, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/3ooZF8i7MOzlNJNQxvinBOoBxGi0blRbOPZe80Ul9-E.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9497aaec18ffe8506d934b682118597986319d8a', 'width': 960}, {'height': 1080, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/3ooZF8i7MOzlNJNQxvinBOoBxGi0blRbOPZe80Ul9-E.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfb7116e9c1c7ce9a9355f02ebe06c77a70a3cdb', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 1086, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/3ooZF8i7MOzlNJNQxvinBOoBxGi0blRbOPZe80Ul9-E.png?auto=webp&amp;s=60b3572c163fbf593a72c6e8f3a528f5a0e8005d', 'width': 1086}, 'variants': {}}]}",,

He's been their best and most consistent player, as well as the team leader no doubt. Not trying to take away from the season he's having. It's just that I've heard people gush about CP3 so often this year, looking at the numbers and recalling the 5-8 Thunder games I've seen in full this year, the actual on-court performances didn't quite live up to the narrative building around his season for me, even though I know his value to this team has been about more than stats. I think there are two main factors at play here.

**1. CP3 Wasn't as Washed as Everyone Thought:** It's pretty clear Paul had a down year last year. There's too many stats worth listing that he was at or near career lows in. But I think a lot of people jumped the gun assuming that meant he would fall off a cliff this year. You also have to consider that Paul had been struggling to get back to 100% health for most of last season, and that Houston runs a system that is arguably the least-friendly to second options in all of the NBA, as well as far from an ideal fit for Paul's floor general style. This season, his numbers have been good, but still down from seasons prior. Exactly what you'd expect from a 34-year-old HoF-bound point. It hasn't been the resurgence some have made it out to be, but at the same time I think expectations were absurdly low for him to have just had one down season.

**2. The Thunder Actually Have a Pretty Good Team:** Here's the second half of why I think CP3 has been given a bit too much credit in this Thunder campaign, and that's because this Thunder roster is not the lottery-bound turd people seemed to expect. Shai has made a pretty significant jump. Steven Adams is still elite at what he does. Gallinari was the best player on a playoff team in the west last year and has almost matched that insane efficiency this year. And you have to wade through a mile of CP3 praise for this season before you even hear Dennis Schroeder's name mentioned. I don't think these guys have received nearly enough credit for the season this team is having, and I think this one probably also just comes down to casual basketball fans only knowing two or three names on this roster.  It's a star's league, and after years of seeing Lebron, Kawhi, Harden and the likes take games over and win them seemingly singlehandedly it makes sense that most basketball fans would over-attribute success/failure to one or two players on the team. But every once in a while, you get a good team with 4-5 guys who could legitimately be the difference-maker on any given night, and I think that catches some fans off guard. Paul is the engine that drives this team, but he's doing that with other pieces in place, it's not as if he's just dragging a bottom-feeder roster to the playoffs. It's just CP3 having a CP3 season, the real surprise has been Billy Donovan actually making the most of his roster talent.

Finally, I just wanna say this it might seem a bit petty and r/nba-ish of me to be worried about ""hype"" around players and whether they're getting enough/too much of it and since it isn't something that can be meaningfully quantified in any way. And that might be fair, discussions about who's over/underrated can definitely prove to be pretty useless in a lot of cases, but within this context of attributing team success, I find it to be an interesting case study for chemistry and team-building as well as for how much credit ""stars"" get compared to that of supporting pieces. Of course hype can be pretty subjective, and if you guys have been hearing all about the Thunder supporting cast and I've just been living under a rock lemme know, just interested to know what you think about Paul's season and what the perception of his season means about the league in general.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,76803,public,self,Is CP3's Season Being a Bit Overrated?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ew5fcy/is_cp3s_season_being_a_bit_overrated/,,,,,,,,,,,

The gist of the argument is that most defensive rebounds would be gathered by a teammate if they weren't gathered by the player who got them. Player role and which teammates happen to be on the court are often bigger factors in individual rebounding totals than rebounding skill. This is especially true in the modern NBA, where bigs often box out so that guards can secure rebounds, and there is a lot of variability in how much time individual players spend on the perimeter (especially bigs). Ben Taylor put out an excellent podcast [diving into this topic](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/ben-taylor/thinking-basketball-podcast/e/66348558) recently (warning: it's 53 minutes on the value of rebounds). 

The idea behind rebounds and RAPM rebounds is similar to points scored and normal offensive RAPM. The more points a player scores, the more likely they are to be helping their team score more points, but the relationship isn't as strong as it might seem. Often the team setup for a shot is more important than the player taking the shot, and point totals ignore efficiency and the opportunity cost of taking a shot. A classic example is Steve Nash, who had a huge positive impact on his team's offenses without scoring lots of points. A better measure than points is how well the team scores when a player is on vs off the court, adjusting for teammates and opponents, which is a good definition for offensive RAPM. Nash fares very well in offensive RAPM, easily [leading the NBA](https://sites.google.com/site/rapmstats/6-year-rapm) in this stat over his prime years.

Rebounding RAPM is computed like normal RAPM, except that instead of players being regressed against team points on each possession, they are regressed against team rebounds on each possession. A player will have high rebounding RAPM if their team gets a higher portion of rebounds when they are on the court adjusting for teammates and opponents. The major downside is the same for both RAPM versions: randomness plays a large role over small and medium sample sizes, and the stat only becomes reliable with multiple seasons of data. But the ability to capture everything that happens on the court makes it a valuable tool over longer time periods.

Currently the only place I'm aware of where RAPM rebounds are publicly available is [NBAshotcharts](http://nbashotcharts.com/rapm5?id=-1983789079). To see Real Adjusted Rebounding Rate on this site, select it on the bar above the data (you may need to click on ""Luck Adjusted RAPM"" or similar and scroll to the right to see it).

Below are the leaders in RAPM rebounds over the last 3 seasons, which is the best time period to judge current ability (balancing sample size vs year-over-year changes). The units are the difference in team rebounds per 100 possessions compared to an average player.

| Enes Kanter       | 4.02    | 3.60     | 0.42     |
| Boban Marjanovic  | 3.58    | 2.55     | 1.04     |
| Jonas Valanciunas | 3.48    | 2.22     | 1.26     |

| DeAndre Jordan    | 3.15    | 2.00     | 1.15     |

To me the most important takeaway from this data is that among the top 10 rebounders, their impact on offensive rebounding is more than double their impact on defensive rebounding. Also while only 3 of the top 10 players in RPG and DREB% over this time period appear on this list, 6 of the top 10 players in OREB% appear. So while there is obviously still a positive relationship between RPG and rebounding impact, among the stats listed on basketball reference OREB% is probably the best measure of overall rebounding impact.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,76803,public,self,On the value of rebounds and an overlooked stat: RAPM rebounds,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ew4o5c/on_the_value_of_rebounds_and_an_overlooked_stat/,,,,,,,,,,,

Obviously with the passing of Kobe Bryant, there is a sense of urgency for the Lakers to win now more than ever to honor Bryant. I think we could all agree if the Lakers fail to reach the championship or if they lose the championship, the city of LA would be very disappointed.

That being said, I think that if the Clippers, specifically, who are very much capable, end up beating the Lakers in say the WCF, I think the damage done to the Clippers brand would be unrecoverable. Now hear me out, the Clippers are in a tough spot. This is arguably the greatest team they have ever had and will potentially be the greatest season they've had to date. In normal circumstances, an organization like the Clippers would and should not stop at anything to win a title.

However, in their attempts to continue to win market share and build their brand as a dominant Los Angeles franchise, winning the title in the 1 year they should not win would cause great distaste and uproar among Angelenos. If some other team beats the Lakers in the playoffs, that's fine - there is no fault except for the Lakers for not being better. If the Clippers beat the Lakers, oh boy. Throw all logic out the window. There is going to be nothing but outrage and pure disdain for the organization that represents the city of Los Angeles, yet took away the redeeming narrative of honoring one of LA's greatest cultural icons. I think the Clippers winning would ultimately drive the franchise to new level of dislike and antagonism from the LA community and would completely ruin any opportunity they might have had of becoming a beloved LA sports franchise.

Teams have actually tanked decades before but was only popularized during the ""Process"" era in Philly. You may have your opinions about tanking but the bottom line is more losses=better pick. Adams Silver solution of equalizing the chances of the bottom tier teams, but in reality, the ideology of tanking still exists since teams will naturally still try to tank to the bottom 5. As NBA fans we may understand the ""bigger picture"" but for casual sports fans, they'd probably consider the NBA as a 2-3 team league with shitty franchises that doesn't prioritize winning. What makes a better product is a league where ALL teams compete year after year while still being able to develop a core and foundation for winning.


My solution is the Proxy draft. The general idea is that the worst team in the league gets the first chance to pick another team to represent them in the lottery, then the 2nd worst gets to pick etc etc. So lets say the Hawks end up with the worst record, Schlenk now gets to decide what team has the best chances of getting a terrible record by the end of the season. Now the Hawks select the Knicks as their proxy, so by the end of the year, the Knicks now end up with the worst record in the league and their lottery chances now transfer to the Hawks.


What we have here is system that no longer incentivizes tanking since the burden of losing to get a better pick for Team A is now given to Team B. At the same time Team B will obviously have no interest in giving Team A a good pick when in fact it forces them to try and win even more games. Now teams will no longer intentionally try and build GLeague lineups like the Process 76ers during the offseason since it would no longer benefit them but Team B.



The biggest question then is when does the proxy draft take place? It cant be during the start of the season cause it would be too volatile and there'd be too many unknown factors in terms of injuries,trades,development etc to make an educated pick. It cant be before the trade deadline since again, what if the Knicks successfully trade for Kawhi Leonard after they were selected as a proxy, therefore ruining the Hawks chances? This is up for debate but imo it is best held somewhere between the end of the trade deadline and the end of February so teams now have a knowledgeable outlook of where opposing teams are in the standings while also lowering the chances of sudden surprises (like Miami Heats 2nd half of the 2017 season). This is also the period when teams go ""full tank mode"" since they would no longer have any chances of making the playoffs.


The Proxy Draft can also bring unprecedented storylines, rivalries, excitement, any hype all across the league. It could be a National TV event that could even rival the real NBA Draft since we would see 1st hand reactions of GM's or representatives being selected as proxy for team rivals. Who else would want to see Steph shake his head when the Warriors are selected as the proxy for the Knicks?

The league started in a enough patch and didn't really gain relevance until the Larry Bird-Magic Johnson era. The league has always been changing, the league in the 70’s was filled with many controversies including the whole cocaine era of the NBA. Even between decades there has been a change on the basketball court. The difference between the early 2010’s and now into the 2020 decade is the three-point ball. In 2010, the Los Angeles Lakers won a championship primarily based on mid range shots and driving the ball straight to the hoop for easy 2’s. Then in mid 2010’s everything changed with the emergence of the three ball brought to you by the Golden State Warriors. The one idea in the NBA that has never changed is the idea that losing can eventually be good in the long run but is even more apparent in today's era more than ever.
The idea of losing on purpose never had a name but was always an idea in the back of owners and coaches minds. This idea was finally given a real name around the year 2013 when the Philadelphia 76ers began what they called “tanking”. This was the first time a team officially believed in the tank process and showed it to the world. The tanking idea is not good for any sports league because the fans lose interest because the little integrity of the sport. This idea of tanking has happened many other times throughout the 76 years of the NBA but has this idea of tanking really actually worked?
The NBA tanking could be defined as a term used to describe when sports teams lose games on purpose to secure some sort of future competitive advantage. Teams such as the Lakers, Warriors, and almost any other team has tried this method. To begin this study we can look at teams who may have lost on purpose for future gain.

A solution is the Stockpiling Rule. 

This rule is that you cannot add/trade more than 1 All Star caliber on a team. Any other all star level player on the team must be drafted and developed by the team. 

Examples: Warriors post KD (2016-2019) doesn't violate these rules. They drafted/developed 3 of their all stars and added 1. 

The Big 3 era in Miami and Boston would be examples that break these rules. The 2020 Lakers team now would be a current example of violating this rule. Cherry picking superstars for more than 1 teams to build a super teams.

This would force teams to to keep the players they have and build a better team long term wise. This would also make drafting more interesting

The overall goal is to not allow a team to stack the decks completely in its favor.

We may be in the golden era of the three-point shot, but the two best teams in the league are the two teams who are most efficient with their shots at the rim. 

Using data from the NBA, I mapped every shot taken by each team this season and binned them into hexagons, ala Kirk Goldsberry. I then calculated every team's points per shot for those attempts in each hexagon to find out who has been most efficient from each location. 

**[This chart](https://imgur.com/xvblgOt) shows the result.**

Each hexagon represents the team with the highest points per shot from that location. 

For example, the Bucks generate about 1.3 points per shot on either side of the rim, which is tops in the league. Meanwhile, Portland (thanks to CJ and Melo) and San Antonio (thanks to DeMar and LaMarcus) are well represented in the mid-range. 

My favorite things that you can see on the map:

* The Sabonis pick and pop at the elbow 

* Kevin Love’s baseline game 

* Melo still thinking its 2007

* CP3’s jumper at the foul line 

* Brandon Clarke's floater

* Luka setting THJ up for a corner three

* George Hill making every single off-center three point shot 

* Dwight, Javale, and AD finishing at the rim

You'll notice that there are several blank spaces just inside the three point line. That's analytics Erne -- no team has taken 30 attempts from those locations. 

**Note that the points per shot calculation does not include shot attempts that led to free throws. So if you're team is really good at generating fouls from a certain location, then they may be underrepresented on this chart**

Just a note, this is a pretty much rough estimation, as there is no specific categorization of assists such as this but there is a type of each shot, so I tried to take a look at some videos of some actions to ""conclude"" which is true catch and shoot, and which isn't.

""Catch And Shoot"" shots are those which were shot directly after the pass by LeBron. Usually, those are jump shots, dunks and layups.

""Created"" shots are ones that required a few extra dribbles after James passed the ball to the player who scored the basket. Such shots came from drives or post shots mostly. 

Just a note, this is a pretty much rough estimation, as there is no specific categorization of assists such as this but there is a type of each shot, so I tried to take a look at some videos of some actions to ""conclude"" which is true catch and shoot, and which isn't.

We strive to paint a vivid picture of the jumbled mess inside our heads. Words are our weapon, our medicine, and our passion. And yet for the entirety of the day Sunday, the words would not come. I glared at the headline on my TV for 6 straight hours. I repeated it in my head at least a hundred times. I collected my thoughts enough to say it out loud. No matter how I processed the words, others would not follow. No thoughts. No reactions. Numb.

I sat on that couch all day, immobilized by a combination of shock and confusion. The news networks repeatedly showed the footage of the wreckage, smoke billowing and helicopter parts strewn about the mountainside. The breaking news headline glaring me in the face. At this point, it’s probably burned permanently into my memory. And with all of this overwhelming evidence in front of me, it still didn’t seem real. I found myself staring at the smoke, half-expecting Kobe to emerge carrying every passenger safely on his back, clutching his daughter in his arms. Because for Kobe, that would have made more sense than what actually transpired. It’s Kobe. Kobe can’t die.

My brain keeps flashing back to the moment I first caught wind of the news. Hungover and wallowing away in self-pity on my couch, I hear my roommate yell out in shock, “NO WAY.” I smile. I lazily turn my head to see what could have possibly happened to elicit this amount of shock from my normally reserved roommate. He’s not smiling. His eyes are wide and I sense he’s a bit frantic. My brain loosely connects the dots for a semi-educated guess, “Celebrity death?” He responds with “Yes, and it’s someone you like a lot.” I’m no longer smiling. As he begins to turn his phone screen away from himself and towards me, I run through my most adored celebrities in my head. My brain assumes a drug overdose. Maybe a musician? Donald Glover? I didn’t even get the opportunity to panic at that thought. Because for the rest of the day, I didn’t really have any thoughts. I was frozen. I stared at the words on that screen and waited. Waited for someone, anyone to speak up and say it wasn’t real. It couldn’t be real. It’s Kobe. Kobe can’t die. He’s not done being Kobe.

For those that aren’t too familiar with Kobe’s career, you’re only a Google search away from reading of an accomplished career marred by controversy both on and off the court. His legacy is a complicated balance beam, with major career milestones weighing against a sometimes self-destructive desire to surpass greatness. Ironically, his unwavering desire to be perfect showed us all that he wasn’t. He made mistakes. As millions share grief at the passing of their idol, others feel that there are a number of reasons not to admire Kobe. Some people elect not to forgive him for his mistakes. That’s fair. But as humans, we are not binarily good or bad. As humans, we’re allowed to move on from mistakes, to correct them, and to try to be better than we were before. It does not mean we have to be forgiven. And I think Kobe knew that. He acknowledged his past, faced it, and tried to be better. Not for all of us, but for himself. For his wife. For his kids. It really felt like the second act of his life was somehow going to be even more special than the first, because it gave us the opportunity to see Kobe through so many different lenses. Kobe the actor. Kobe the producer. Kobe the analyst. And the one I was personally enjoying the most, Kobe the father.

I’ve struggled internally to grasp why this has been so hard to comprehend. I didn’t know Kobe personally, and he didn’t even know I existed. I’d never even seen him in real life. Horrible things happen everyday. But when someone who seems to transcend life has it taken away from them in an instant, it’s jarring. It just doesn’t feel like Kobe was supposed to be celebrated this way, posthumously and with an overwhelming sense of finality. It’s an inexplicably grounding experience. For those in my generation, we don’t know of a world without Kobe. Every record broken, every big performance, we turn our ears to listen for Kobe’s insight. He was supposed to grow old to share his wisdom with future generations of superstars. To see the Mamba Mentality manifest itself in the youth that he inspired. To walk his daughters down the aisle. To live. It’s Kobe. Kobe can’t die.

And so it would appear that two days later, I’ve managed to find the words. And yet it still feels like it’s not enough. In the same way that words could not do his career justice, they seem to fall short in trying to make sense of his sudden absence. Death is confusing, and it’s hard. We react and process grief in different ways. For many, death is a reminder of the futility of life. For others, it’s viewed as a time to celebrate the lasting impact of a life lived. Kobe’s death is a reminder of both. The futility of life in the sense that no day is guaranteed but also by making us all realize that no life is futile if it is lived properly. He leaves behind a complex legacy. But he was an idol for so many different kinds of people, from LeBron James to a midwestern kid who rode the bench. Kobe became larger than life, and his spirit transcended sports.The Mamba Mentality will find its way back, as Kobe always did. After all, it’s Kobe. And Kobe can’t die.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,76737,public,self,To Lose A Legend,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/evfohj/to_lose_a_legend/,,,,,,,,,,,

I decided to actually do the research.\n\n- There\'s a myth that Kobe\'s defense team leaked the name of Kobe\'s accuser. \n\nThis is not true. Kobe\'s lawyers were allowed, by the judge, to bring up Faber\'s name. The Court and the Eagle County Justice Center\'s staff accidentally leaked the name. \n\nhttp://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/judge-dont-call-kobe-bryant-accuser-victim\n\n- Prosecutor dismissed a witness, without telling the defense,  simply because he contradicted their evidence. \n\nThe sexual assault expert claimed jaw injury and vagina trauma are very much possible in consensual sex. Why is this so important? Prosecutor\'s entire case was predicated on the neck injury and vaginal trauma. Weirdly enough, this is never mentioned among news sites attacking Bryant. \n\nhttp://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/09/03/authorities-defend-handling-kobe-case.html\n\n- The accuser had sex **hours**  after her encounter with Kobe Bryant. \n\nHowever, before you guys try to use the ""Sexual assault victims can be very unpredictable"" card, (Which is somewhat valid) before this evidence was revealed, the accuser and the prosecutor\'s stances differed strongly from this. To exemplify, prosecutor tries to fight this evidence by saying she had sex BEFORE the encounter, but the forensic expert strongly doubted this stance. \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/04/us/papers-reveal-new-details-in-kobe-bryant-rape-case.html\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/big-win-for-kobe-defense/\n\n- Before the actual trial took place, including the civil court, the accuser bragged about the money she was going to get from Kobe. . \n\nYou know what\'s worse? 3 days **before** Kobe was charged, she was seen by more than **5** people bragging about her encounter with Kobe.\n\nhttp://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/kobe-accuser-bragged-partygoer-happy-article-1.512242\nhttp://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/11/06/docs-kobe-accuser-discussed-award-money.html\n\n- Her ex-friend reveals the accuser had celebrity addiction for a long time.

Not only evidence, they were badly losing against Kobe\'s defense team:\n\n&amp;gt;""This ruling will make it much, much tougher for prosecutors to convict Bryant of sexual assualt,\'\' says legal analyst Cohen. ""The physical evidence against him never was that strong to begin with and now this evidence is likely to tilt the \'he said, she said\' battle squarely in Bryant\'s favor.""\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/big-win-for-kobe-defense/\n\n- The accuser lied and changed her story multiple times. \n\nI am okay with giving accusers the benefit of the doubt, but this was alarming. Because there was a witness who saw her without any visible discomfort, she claimed she was forced to wash her face and settle down before leaving Kobe\'s room. What\'s even worse? she was given a chance to correct herself months after the initial statement; she continued the lie. She didn\'t admit to her mistake for a whole year. \n\nhttp://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/kobe-accuser-mixups-admits-lies-claim-article-1.548757\n\n-  *She dropped her case BECAUSE she couldn’t keep her story straight, and was atrocious in her mock trial set up by her own team.*\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2004-11-07-0411070179-story,amp.html\n\n\n\n\n\n- Finally, the settlement. People actually use this as Kobe\'s confession. \n\nKobe was strongly advised by his own defense team AND other prosecution to settle this case. Why? He could risk losing everything, and it does not help that he\'s a black man. If he didn\'t settle, it would take years for this case to conclude; it\'s a compromise with you and the defendant; you don\'t think the accuser wanted Kobe to say those things? \n\nTo substantiate this, the accuser asked for ""unspecified amount of money, as well as public vindication."". She got both in the settlement. The **accuser** is the one who wanted this comment.  \n\nAs a user from this thread pointed out: \n\n\n\n&amp;gt;Its what the lawyers, from both sides, agreed to make Kobe sign to end it; it has nothing to do with Kobe\'s actual feelings or the reality of the case.\n\nThis is a settlement.\n\nhttp://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-09-28/news/0409290017_1_accuser-lin-wood-kobe-bryant\n\n- *He had extra pressure to settle after his wife had a miscarriage during this time.* \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/kobe-bryant-carries-guilt-wife-miscarriage-article-1.2135283%3foutputType=amp\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLook, by all accounts, this was a false accusation. I will never say I am  100% certain, but I am sure enough that he did not rape this woman.\n\nIt\'s really funny how the media changed narratives to fit their agendas.

Yesterday, the sports world was shook by an unspeakable tragedy. Not only the sports world, but the world at large. Sunday, the world lost a legend to a random act of god. Not only this, but the world lost eight more lives alongside Kobe Bryant, including his 13 year old daughter, Gianna. 

As Bryant’s Sikorsky S-76 changed the landscape of the hills in Calabasas, the entire landscape of Los Angeles’ culture was changed forever. Kobe was supposed to be invincible. Kobe wasn’t just part of LA. Kobe WAS LA. As of Monday afternoon, there were over 4 million tweets in memoriam of Kobe. 

Bryant retired in 2016, capping off his storied career with a 60 point game in Los Angeles against the Utah Jazz. It was the highest scoring retirement game in the history of the NBA. 

This year, he will be elected into the Hall of Fame, where his speech would have been one for the ages. Luckily, he gave us an Academy Award winning animated short, Dear Basketball. 

Kobe’s cultural reach went far beyond just basketball. An entire generation of kids that grew up watching Bryant yell “Kobe!” every time they shoot a piece of paper into a trash can.

For kids like myself who grew up playing sports, it was his “Mamba Mentality” that drove us to work harder and perfect their craft. It was that mentality and work ethic that brought me here to Flagler College to run cross country, which unfortunately did not work out.

That mentality drives me to do this job as a writer, and write this story that is incredibly emotional for myself to write. I am a lifelong Lakers fan, and Bryant is my favorite athlete in the history of any sport. 

As a child growing up, I knew I wanted to be a sports reporter. One of my goals was to one day meet Bryant. Growing up on the East Coast, some of my fondest memories were watching the clinic that Bryant put on every night. 

There are so many young adults that idolized Kobe like myself. This will never be an easier pill to swallow. We lost a hero at the young age of 41. His daughter Gianna was supposed to be the biggest thing in women’s basketball. Both men’s and women’s basketball were robbed of a lifetime more of the Bryant family. Not only basketball fans, but Bryant’s family was robbed of a lifetime of memories with Kobe and Gianna. 

His daughter Natalia is a senior in high school and will go off to college without her dad and little sister. His three year old Bianka will have very little memories of her father and older sister Gigi. His six month old Capri will never remember a single moment with her father or older sister Gigi. Capri will only know her father through pictures, videos and stories. His wife Vanessa, who he had been with for over two decades just lost her daughter and long time husband. 

The family was finally going to have Bryant at home, bringing his Mamba Mentality to being a super dad. We saw that in his few short years of retirement while he coached the late Gigi’s team. 

We all can take some lessons from Kobe, from the good and bad of his life. Love your family and spend as much quality time with the people you love. Be singularly focused on the task and goal you are currently focused on. Learn from your mistakes and apologize for your wrongs. 

He taught us with his academy award for “Dear Basketball” to go outside our comfort zone and expand our horizons as people. Be fearless. Don’t listen to outside criticism. Be your own biggest fan. Be confident. Never waste a moment. Continue to learn more every day. Be better than you were yesterday. Live without fear. Live every moment and day such as it will be your last. This was his “Mamba Mentality.” It is the legacy that he will leave behind. 

Kobe spent his last moments with his daughter, spreading love to what she loved. He was passing down his love of the game and knowledge to her and the other young girls on the team. The reason Kobe had a helicopter was to be able to avoid traffic and balance his maniacal work ethic and still be able to pick up his kids from school and get to their school plays and sporting events. He was a super dad. 

While we will never see Kobe Bryant or his daughter pick up a basketball again, they are not gone forever. We will see him every day with the lessons he taught us. Whenever you throw something in the trash, he is remembered. Any time we see a fadeaway jump shot, we will see Kobe. Any time we see his girls and wife, he lives on. His parents Pam and Joe carry on his legacy. 

We must not forget the things Bryant left behind. Mamba forever.

I can't even watch without thinking about how Kobe impacted every single one of the players on the court and even impacted me and my love for the game. 

I still remember watching the playoffs every year and rooting against Kobe because he was that dam good. Then years later when I rewatched all of his games I realized just how special Kobe was. A player with such dedication and attention to the minor details just made him so much better than any player on the floor.

PG. Michael Jordan. I mean do I have to say more

SG. Klay Thompson. A perfect spot up shooter that can shoot lights out and space the floor. Also has amazing defence and can guard other positions.

SF. Larry Bird. Again great spot up shooter and can space the floor. Also has great basketball IQ and had great off ball defence.

PF. Kevin Garnett. Was a great defender and could guard other positions from pick and rolls. Also had a good mid range and free throw and in the modern NBA that mid range would probably carry over to a good 3 point shot.

C. This was the hardest spot as there is so many to choose from. I’m going with Hakeem Olajuwon as he was a great defender in the paint, could grab board, and had some unstoppable post moves.

But there's a strange division between them. 

The top two defenses, Milwaukee and toronto, allow the most open threes, which seems counterintuitive considering how efficient a shot it is. Even last year, Milwaukee's defense was allowing the most in the NBA. 
It's different for #3 Philly and #4 Boston though.  Philadelphia is arguably the best 3pt defense in the NBA, they allow the fewest open three's and the fewest three pointers in the NBA.  Boston is also quite good at limiting open three's and is middle-of-the-pack for three's allowed. 

|Team|Defensive Rating (ranking)|Wide-open three's allowed per game (ranking)|
:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Milwaukee Bucks|101.2 (1st)|20.0 (1st)|
|Toronto Raptors|104.4 (2nd)|19.2 (2nd)|
|Philadelpha 76ers|105.0 (3rd)|13.2 (30th)|
|Boston Celtics|105.2 (4th)|14.8 (23rd)|

That said, the tradeoff is Toronto and Milwaukee are both elite within 5-feet of the rim. Within 5-feet of the rim, Milwaukee allows the fewest shots at the lowest percentage, Toronto is just two spots behind.  

How do you guys think this style of defense will translate to the playoffs? 

The obvious example would be last year's Eastern Conference Finals, Milwaukee's defense arguably got ""solved"" by Toronto.  In the last 4 games of the conference finals, Toronto had an offensive rating of 111.3, and the Bucks were allowing 23 wide-open three's per game. This could be considered unlucky for the Bucks however, since they ran into the best three-point shooting team in the entire NBA, something which might not happen this season.",False,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,76610,public,self,The strange dichotomy of the top NBA defenses,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/eufqzc/the_strange_dichotomy_of_the_top_nba_defenses/,,,,,,,,,,,

It was back in 08. I was 12 and I just started 6th grade at one of the local schools (Slovenia). I remember walking on the court, not knowing what the F am I doing there, because the only reason I was there was due to my parents and my PE teacher forcing me into sports. ""Basketball?!?!?"" I thought to myself, ""what do I know about basketball?"" I was never really interested in it, but I did sure as hell know at least one thing about it, or better yet, a name. Kobe Bryant. EVERYONE were talking about you. And whenever I saw friends playing the game and shooting the rim, they were always screaming your name. Like that: ""Kobeeeeeeeeee!"" You can hear it yourself, can't you? They always made it sound so cool, even when they were 'miles' off target. So, naturally, I picked up on it. From the moment I took my first shot and continued my short-lived, but quite successful BBall career, I developed a habit. Any time I would try an insane shot on the court, even as close as from the free throw line; when I would walk by a trash can and try to 'score' with a paper towel, rolled into a ball; when I would try some stupid 360 spin on the 3-point line and attempt the shot; when I would try some silly shot at the trash on the street, or even when I saw someone else try to shoot the ball... all of these, and I mean ALL, were followed by the internationally famous sigh that is heard all across the globe, from young and old: ""KOOBEEEEEEEEE,"" accompanied by the extended shooting arm and by slightly ajared eyes to follow the shot.

You made this a thing, Kobe. So this is my pledge that I will always strive to follow my every shot with your name coming from my lips, and while doing that I will also imagine myself playing in a full stadium, filled by loyal fans. And in my head your name will not be shouted by me, but it will be heard as a scream from the commentator, accompined by the deafening roars of the crowd. And I will not be I, but I shall be you, forever rising from the ground to take that last second shot to win the game. And whenever I will get the chance to play ball with the generations to come, I will make sure they know the name of one of the greatest athletes of all time. Kobe Bryant. Your name shall forever echo in the eternity.

They are the rarest and most important asset in the league, and it’s pretty close to impossible to win a title without at least two. That being said we saw this movie with Chris Paul and Blake Griffin. It was clear the two did not compliment each other, mostly because they both were best with the ball in their hands. The clippers should have traded Blake while he was still in his prime for 2-3 good players and some future picks. Let Paul do his thing, surround him and Deandre with shooters. 

 Now I’m not saying give either away, they are title contenders now, but clearly the best of Simmons or Embiid will exist away from each other. I’d go for the big fish first and see if I could make something happen.

Some big trades I see as possible:

Embiid for Beal. I think Washington has to make that deal, and I’d be pretty interested in seeing wall come back with a pure post player. Beal would be perfect for that team, flexible, still good defensively, and someone who can create and make the tough shots.

Simmons for Dame. If Portland misses out on the playoffs, how do you turn down that deal? From the 76ers side you get one of the best leaders in the game not to mention an all NBA caliber scorer and shooter. Dame has a toughness that the Philadelphia crowd would get behind, plus Dame has proven he has zero fear taking and making buckets with everything on the line.

Simmons for Harden. Spread the floor with shooters and just let harden and Embiid pick and roll all game. Probably wouldn’t be pretty but could be Harden’s best shot at a title. Biggest issue would be Houston finding someone willing to take on Westbrook, couldn’t imagine him and Simmons on the same team working.

In these trades I think they are giving up the most “value” in a vacuum, but I think it makes the team better and worth doing",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,76542,public,self,Embiid and Simmons are better apart and Philly should address this in the off-season,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/euat2f/embiid_and_simmons_are_better_apart_and_philly/,,,,,,,,,,,

Since we're decent ways into the season I thought I'd compile my current predictions for the All-NBA teams this year, with short descriptions of each so that we can critique:

**All-NBA 1st Team**

* G: Luka Doncic, James Harden
* F: LeBron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo
* C: Rudy Gobert

Pretty predictable apart from Rudy Gobert. Since most of the elite centers have struggled this year I'd give the nod to him as the current DPOY and he's shown improvement in his offensive game. Jazz are currently the #2 seed in the West largely behind his play.

**All-NBA 2nd Team**

* G: Damian Lillard, Jimmy Butler
* F: Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis
* C: Nikola Jokic

Lillard is quietly having his best season yet, posting all-time highs in points, assists and shooting efficiency. It's a shame that Portland has struggled. Jimmy Butler has been a workhorse and has embraced the Miami culture lifting them to an impressive record. Kawhi is posting career-highs in points and assists and still plays All-NBA level defence, and would be higher if he wasn't load managing. AD is AD. Jokic gets the nod over KAT here since he has been healthier and the Nuggets are performing pretty well.

**All-NBA 3rd Team**

* G: Kemba Walker, Trae Young
* F: Jayson Tatum, Khris Middleton
* C: Karl-Anthony Towns

Trae Young is posting 29 points and 9 assists this year per game and offensively has almost been as impressive as Luka. Defensively he is still a big liability and his team has struggled due to factors beyond his control. Kemba and Tatum are flourishing in Boston and Khris Middleton has been a model of efficiency for the league-best Bucks.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,76495,public,self,All-NBA Teams So Far,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/etzx3t/allnba_teams_so_far/,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s okay to think they are overrated and point out weaknesses but as a fan of D lo I’m just frustrated every time he can’t get anything positive about him.

Although he was never
selected to the All Star team, which, in my subjective opinion, is undeserved, Gobert has been a player of
incredible value ​​for the Utah Jazz. Their entire defense scheme is based on Gobert.

In the first [chart](https://i.imgur.com/W65gIId.png), I showed how big the difference between Gobert and the other Utah Jazz players really is when it comes to amount of defended shots. Also, there is a very big difference in the success of defending the shot for two of them..

What I have noticed on several occasions while watching the Jazz team is that the players on which the pick is made are always going over the pick, as shown [here](https://streamable.com/1tr8l). In my opinion I think they are trying to prevent three point attempt, because they have a security blanket in Gobert waiting for a potential pass or a drive from a ball handler so they can afford the risk of going over the pick. Maybe
 my doubts are confirmed by a [chart](https://i.imgur.com/TBLeaLr.png) comparing the number of allowed 2 point and 3 point shots, which shows exactly how Utah allows very little three pointers.

Because of these things, Gobert is the player who defends the most shots in the game, the [figure](https://i.imgur.com/ff5IWBi.png) shows he defends 19.7 shots per game,
and what is even more impressive is that the success rate of the opposing players is only 39.8%!!!! With that percentage he is
at about 20th rank in entire NBA (when looking at players who have played at least 20 games) which is really impressive when we consider
that Pascal Siakam is the closest to Gobert with 14.7 shots allowed per game while allowing a smaller percentage of shots to the opponent.

You can see this information on the [chart](https://i.imgur.com/ff5IWBi.png), I have extracted the names of some players who defend a lot of shots, here the only goal was to show how big the difference is between Gobert and the other players on the subject.

If I limit the [data to only 2-point shots](https://i.imgur.com/x8yKjQP.png), then Gobert moves into the top 5 by opponent's shot percentage.
Interestingly, there are three Milwaukee players, Giannis, Middleton and Matthews in front of him, but they have significantly fewer shots allowed
(6.1, 3.7 and 4.0 respectively). When it comes to the Bucks, we still have to praise Brooke Lopez, who is also a very good defensive player. But that fact
is actually another plus for Gobert, as it shows how much he stands out with Utah on defense ..

Speaking of some more data, Gobert is also 3rd (!!!!!) in Win Shares in the league this season, mostly because of
Defensive Win Shares (DWS). Win Share is a statistic that estimates the number of wins a player has contributed. So Gobert currently has
7.4 WS, 3.1 of which are defensive.

And even though this is a defense analysis, I will also touch on the offensive side of Gobert, where he should be praised in one not so closely followed segment,
Screen Assists. He leads the league in Screen assists and points earned through them.

Given that Utah is playing Dallas Mavericks in couple of hours, who have the NBA's best offense (if we're looking at Off Rating), we can conclude that we will have a very interesting game in front of us.

I'm hoping that it'll find a better audience here: 

As I'm sure many of you know, in recent months there's been a lot of discussion about potential changes to the NBA schedule. I think that's long overdue, particularly in light of changes to the ways the game is played by players and experienced by fans. But none of the proposed changes that I've seen floated around make all that much sense to me. So far as I can tell, all of the proposals involve a mid- or end-of- season tournament that would replace some limited number of games that make up the existing 82-game schedule, with some combination of cash or draft considerations to attempt to incentivize players to take the tournament seriously. Unfortunately, I just do not see these proposals -- replacing one set of regular season games among the same set of teams for another -- as a meaningful improvement over the status quo. Nor do I see the proposed incentives as being nearly adequate given the primacy of the NBA championship and the size of the cash prizes in relation to player comp.

I do have a proposal for improving the NBA schedule, however -- one that I haven't seen raised elsewhere. That proposal is this: a European-soccer-style tournament comprised of teams (by no means does it have to be 30 of them, and probably it shouldn't be) made up of players from various ***regions***.  This tournament could take place at any time, but I think during the season, possibly intermittently for a couple of weeks at a time, would be best.

In my opinion (which, of course, all of this is), this type of tournament has tons of advantages over the existing schedule and the other alternatives that are on offer (together with a few real disadvantages).  Most importantly, this proposal introduces substantial change in team composition while at the same time allowing NBA rosters to remain intact. I think there's a very real and growing interest in seeing players combine in different ways (free agency continues to get more and more popular), and that discontinuity would be baked into this proposed restructuring. Rather than free agency being the sole opportunity for players to shift among teams, under this proposal such transitions would be part of the basic fabric of the league. A different set of teams, made up of different combinations of players, competing for a different but potentially equally meaningful prize. (As a side benefit, implementing this proposal could ease some of the existing pressure on players to change teams.)

This structure also takes advantage of and helps to reinforce regional systems and legacies that already exist, including youth and college teams and networks.  While I'm not personally much of a basketball historian, I at least know of regional traditions, like those of New York City, Philadelphia and Washington, DC.  How cool would it be to have a New York regional team?  Or does it make more sense to have a tri-state regional team?  Northeast?  New York City only?  California, or North/South?  I think these would be really fun questions for basketball historians and others to answer collaboratively, and even that process could be handled in a public and interesting way.  (While I have some issues with Bill Simmons's recent approach to what he calls ""player empowerment"" -- a topic for another day -- his input could be invaluable here.) Plus, regional teams could align themselves with retired players from the region, maybe even as coaches. Or they could train at famous gyms or playgrounds outside of NBA arenas. All of this (and more) would factor into, and then reinforce, the legitimacy of the regional distinctions.

Another advantage is that the players who would make up these teams are presumably already friends, or at a minimum know each other well.  By definition they would have grown up together, played together or against each other, or even have gone to the same schools.  So you have something beyond the contingencies of the draft and the decision-making of general managers to tie players together.  And since there are no trades, that connection would continue to grow over time.

There are a few other obvious advantages, but in terms of drawbacks, I see teams' loss of control over players as a real and possibly dispositive issue.  But European soccer clubs accept this relative loss of control as a price for expanding the popularity of the game.  What better way to develop the interest of potential fans in emerging markets than to give them, in effect, a team of their own, even without further expansion?  Dividing up the world outside of the US could be complicated, but it could also be a ton of fun.  Revenue allocation would of course be another issue, but that doesn't seem insurmountable -- maybe the existing teams could be seeded an equal share of the regional teams.  Who knows, but it strikes me -- as someone outside the industry -- as workable (albeit complicated).

Anyway, I have more thoughts but this post (my first) has gone on more than long enough. For those of you that read all the way to the end, I sincerely appreciate it.

So, that being said, what rule change(s) do you think would shift the balance a little/

1.  Widen the court, make the corner 3 pointer regulation
2. Move the line back
3. Widen the lane (minimal)
4. Instead of 3 seconds in the lane, 5 seconds, 20 seconds (I know its not called much)
5. Restrictions on defending in the paint?

In my opinion, it is the last player that can do that. My argument would be that Adam Silver is planning to reduce number of regular season games. That makes almost impossible Kareem's record even harder to beat. You have to literally play 20 seasons without big injuries and average 25+ per game until your 40s. So my guess would be that at least there are major rule changes, for example 4 point line, then there is no chance to surpass Kareem record for newcomers. From active players, KD had most chances, but he is injured for this whole season and we dont know in what shape he will return.

Anyway, to be able to keep track of LeBron's progress, I created a website where after every NBA game it shows how many points LBJ needs to surpass Kobe, Malone, Kareem. Calculations are based on Lebron's current PPG.

Gentry has been playing him at both the four and the five. Outside of the three point barrage in his debut, his best offensive stretches have come with him at the four. When he’s at the four, opposing teams are trying to guard them with their bigger wings. Zion is eating them alive in the post, even bigger guys tonight like Craig and Grant. It also helps defensively because, excluding the amazing block tonight, Zion hasn’t been a great rim protector. Opposing teams have been having layup lines when Zion is playing at the five. 

I really don’t like him at the five. It limits his ability to get out in transition, and he’s often in a passive trailer role on offense at the top of the key. It keeps him away from what he does best, attacking as the roll man and feasting on mismatches in the post, as well as crashing the offensive glass. Ideally I’d want him occupying the dunker spot or in the screener role, as well as experimenting with him as an offensive fulcrum at the elbows/top of the key almost like Nikola Jokic. 

Another thing worth examining is who has been playing around him. While he hasn’t been his best when he’s playing the five, it does give him the most room to operate offensively. It seems to me that playing him alongside guys who occupy the midrange/paint clogs it up and makes it tough for Zion to build up speed and attack. I haven’t liked playing a rolling center next to him, like Hayes or Favors, for this reason. Furthermore, I don’t know if Ingram is a perfect fit. They occupy some of the same spaces on the court. Ingram has been great this year when playing downhill attacking off of a post up of face up in the midrange. There have been multiple times in the past two games when the help coming from Zion’s man has made it tough for Ingram. The same is true in the opposite, Zion doesn’t have as much room to build up speed or find lanes while Ingram is on the court. 

I would love to see Zion play with a floor spacing center who can protect the rim. Now, those guys are super rare so it may take a bit for the Pelicans to find one. In the meantime, I would love to see Gentry at least try playing Melli next to him. I think surrounding Zion with shooters and ball handlers in a four out system is the best way to maximize his talents. Ideally, one of those guys would be able to protect the rim on defense too. All of Holiday, Ball, Hart, Redick, Moore, Melli, NAW and Jackson are great fits next to him for this reason. I’m not sold on any of Favors, Hayes, or Ingram being long term fits.

I would love to see how Zion would look playing next to a “unicorn” big like Kristaps Porzingis, Jaren Jackson Jr or Brook Lopez. Tonight got me thinking that Jokic and him would be incredible as well. Again, these guys are very tough to find and even tougher to acquire. The Pelicans have plenty of time though, it’ll be interesting to watch.

To be a bit reductive: players above (or to the left of the line) received disproportionately more player votes than fan votes. In other words, these players are held in higher regard among their peers than among their fans. 

In my mind, two of the biggest outliers on the chart are Bam Adebayo and Will Barton

Adebayo received 91 player votes, which is 10th most in the entire NBA. However, his fan vote total was  718,240, 35th most in the NBA. Now, Adebayo is likely going to get voted into the All-Star game as a reserve, but it's clear casual fans aren't that familiar with him. 

Meanwhile, Will Barton received 21 player votes (38th most), and just 28,325 fan votes (167th most). Barton will not make the All-Star team (and he shouldn't), but it's pretty clear there's a huge gap b/w player perception of him and awareness among fans. 

It's worth mentioning that Bam and Barton are analytic darlings this season, especially Barton who ranks near the top of most all-in-one metrics.

He's not posting eye popping box score stats, but he reminds me a lot of rookie Malcolm Brogdon where he just makes good decisions or makes decisions/reads that make sense all the time while he is on the floor.

On the other side of the coin I thought Coby White would be a better PG out the gate. I thought Chicago with 3rd year Lauri and a big bodied PG to pair with the smaller/defensively limited LaVine would give this team the chance to contend for the 8 seed but the only part of his game thats translated to the league so far is his stroke, and even that seems streaky at times. Top 10 in rookie scoring but with his green light it sometimes looks like he thinks he's top 10 in scoring in the whole league.

My all-rookie teams today would look something like this:

#First Team

Ja Morant - ROTY and it isn't particularly close. While Nunn is slightly ahead in terms of point production, Ja is leading all rookies in assists, and to avoid focusing on counting stats, Ja just looks like a natural pro already. Watching Memphis games is really exciting right now because he's high octane on offense, pretty engaged on defense for a rookie guard, and he's already shown the ability to make his own luck on offense. Hes comfortable shooting outside (ask that mothafucka James Harden bout him) but even if his shot isnt falling he still moves the ball and attacks the rim

Kendrick Nunn - the leading rookie scorer, and a fluid moving combo guard, the only concern around Nunn is that this is just all the stripes this tiger has. At 24 years old he may already be what he is or he may be a legit late blooming star, but with limited size and physical tools on defense and limited distribution as a ball handling guard, projecting into a Lou Will type of guy can still yield a productive career, especially for being a G League guy who was cut last year, but him being the second best rookie I feel is more a function of him being developmentally ahead of the class than him being necessarily a high upside prospect. And that's okay not everyone can be drafted at 19.

Rui Hachimura - I thought this about him before the draft but he had some of the best measurables and the most room to grow of any of the top wing prospects in the draft, and those gifts have been on display in a very intelligent and methodical way this year in Washington. He can play at different gears, if he's feeling it he can be the main shot taker on offense (at least for Washington and their patchwork offensive attack that has proven to work to some degree), but he's also not a major defensive liability like a lot of players this young are and he's especially not prone to letting his offensive flow effect his defensive intensity, a sign of some considerable mental maturity.

Tyler Herro - Herro has been everything people wanted Mario Hezonja to be as a prospect. A jumpshooter with a ton of confidence and drive; Herro has made due with some less than desirable measurables as a guard/wing hybrid to be better on defense then a lot of people expected and has saved some pretty lousy offensive nights for Miami as a microwave type scorer from 3 and off the dribble in the midrange. Nunn's still the better defender don't get me wrong, but he hasn't been a traffic cone out there. The ball handling gets a little shaky some times and he has some habits that could stand to be broken but for the 14th pick getting a guy who can fill it up like Herro has shown was a slam dunk pick by Miami's impressive FO

Brandon Clarke - Minnesota and Phoenix have to be kicking themselves for letting Clarke fall through their grasp when he would have been a great fit for their teams. The jumpshot is inconsistent, still has to be respected though; but the shooting isn't Clarke's chief contribution pretty much any night at all. His BBIQ and defensive versatility as a tweener forward have been really impressive, taking a range of assignments and having held up guarding anyone from bigger 2s to even some 5s. His defensive activity level and lack of need for touches on offense to be engaged on defense makes Clarke a really valuable building block along 2 guys in Memphis who can fill it up like Ja Morant and JJJ. While he may not make the league's first all-rookie ballot (an award that notoriously favors counting stats), hes a rookie that I'm confident can contribute to winning basketball for a long time in the league.

#2nd Team

PJ Washington - in the most Charlotte way Charlotte has ever Charlotte'd, the selection of PJ Washington has been of confounding quality to the team overall; his performance has been just good enough so that the team that tried their damnedest to clear their quality-player cupboard hasn't bottomed all the way out into the top 3-4 range in the draft lotto. With efficient shooting splits (48 FG% and 42% 3p%) and a respectable double digit scoring season, the only reason he's not first team over Brandon Clarke for me is the lack of other game affecting skills. He's shown pedestrian rebounding skill, some heavy feet on defense, and a surprisingly below average FT% for a space making 4 which limits him to being a spot up shooter instead of giving him the ability to also attack closeouts on the dribble.

RJ Barrett - I don't think any rookie in this class besides Ja could have shined in MSG this year with the dysfunction in that office, but the only starter level skill he's displayed so far is scoring. I do think he's had a slightly worse year from 3 than I think will grow to be in his career average (33% right now, no reason he can't break 38% or higher he doesn't appear to have much of a mental block or significant fundamental flaws in his shot) but 39% from the field is bad. Not saying rookies aren't allowed to be bad, but if he does get it together finishing at the rim that can open up a lot of the game he's looking for.

Eric Paschall - While he may be the beneficiary of being on a really depleted roster where someone has to put up numbers, Paschall's 3 level scoring game has appeared NBA level for a lot of the year as GSW's defacto complimentary scoring option to Russell and Damion Lee. He's come to the league with a sizeable offensive toolbox and he has a good idea of how to punish most matchups; he posts up guards in switches, takes plodding bigs to the perimeter, etc. Hes kind of in the same boat as RJ where aside from scoring most of his displayed skills have been rotation-replacement level. He has a bad habit of checking with his hands or getting turned around if his man gets the step on him defensively, you'd like to see him rebound better for a guy of his size/bulk at the forward position. His tenure in golden state is going to depend on how quickly he picks up on these other skills, he's not going to get many scoring opportunities when Steph and Klay are back in the lineup.

Darius Garland - His shooting splits are meh (40/35/85), a 1.25:1 AST:Turnover ratio is bad, but hear me out: I think he'd actually be more efficient if he was not sharing ballhandling duties with Collin Sexton. It has been counterproductive at times for Beilein to run offense through Garland (or Sexton either for that matter) due to his low overall FG% and pedestrian AST rate. The pre-draft fears that he's more Jason Terry than Jason Kidd (especially with him calling himself a pass first guard) are completely valid. However, Jason Terry would be a genuinely quality starter in today's NBA and not to mention; he has kept his head down and been relatively consistently meh in spite of a turbulent relationship between Love, Beilein, and the press in Cleveland. Cleveland doesnt have much time to make a decision on this backcourt experiment but if I were to keep one of Sexton or Garland I'd be floating around the trade market to see if Sexton has any value between now and the off-season 

Jaxson Hayes - I personally love me some bouncy, long rim running/protecting 5s so my last spot on my ballot may not have enough tangible numbers to get much of any traction. BUT, he has grasped NBA defense faster than a lot of players in his same mold (Capela, Gobert, etc.) And while he isnt quite the 1 man block party that someone like Mitchell Robinson appears to be, the physical tools and understanding of his role in NO's offense have shown wisdom beyond his 19 years. The end to end speed he's displayed can be jaw dropping when the Pels actually get out and run with him on the floor. The fouls are something of an issue; he's leading all rookies at 123 personals without a secure starting role on his own team, but the raw talent and understanding of his limited offensive game are good building blocks

I've watched most of Boban's games, I'm a big fan of the big guy. A lot of people say he can't play 25 or 30 minutes a night or he's not built for it. I think that's just flat wrong, its more that NBA coaches won't let him play, he never asks to come out of the game, but rather he gets burnt a lot when he's forced to switch on smaller guards that can have their way with him on the perimeter. So he's seen as a liability on the defensive end specially with man heavy schemes.

Watched a recent interview with SVGundy and he said he wished he played him more in his Detroit days. I think the consensus is Boban would have been great player a decade prior when posting up was a thing and playing back to the basket was in. 

I kinda wish he would be unleashed and allowed to play big minutes, because literally no one can stop the big fella when he gets rolling, he's literally unguardable, he's too big to be stopped, plus he can shoot! He's got great touch all the way to the three point line. 

To solve the defensive issue I'd plant him in the paint and get 4 guys hovering around the perimeter. Good luck trying to score inside against Boban and good luck getting a clean look on the perimeter. I guess this is just wishful thinking though. 

Can someone also please clarify, if you're playing a zone defense can you have a man in the paint for more then 5 seconds or not? 

Also if other teams manage to get Boban in a pick and roll situation can't the on ball defender just go over the screen every time and force the ball handler to the paint where he'll be waiting to block them to oblivion! 

I kinda think Boban's coaches from Pop, SVG and Carlisle are all complicit in not getting the most out of him considering he's a great shooter and has that size. I'm also a big fan of Pop and Carlisle even SVG but I think the big fella had been let down by all of them to some degree. 

Also I'm aware Boban's foot speed and lateral quickness isn't great, they are his biggest weaknesses. But look at a player like Rudy Gobert who also can't defend on the perimeter and has the same weaknesses. For some reason the Jazz have been able to adjust their defensive schemes to enhance Gobert's strengths and limit him from having his weaknesses exploited. So why can't the same be done for Boban? Who in essence is a bigger and better shooting Gobert?

Anyway, might have gone a little overboard with this post, but if now isn't the time for Boban to get a chance to dominate I worry the time will never come.

For example, the Lakers played OKC without Lebron or AD and managed to beat them. However, the Clippers have lost against the Grizzlies (a worse team) with Kawhi on the roster and then lost to the Hawks (without Trae Young) without their two stars. However, the narrative still seems to be that the Clippers are definitely the better team.

I'll preface this by saying that I'm clearly a biased Jazz fan but I think he would have an incredible case to be made for it.  
  
In 2016-17 he had a better season than DeAndre Jordan but missed out. This was likely because the 4th seeded Clippers *deserved* an all-star and their other players were injured. It was also a sort of lifetime achievement award for DJ and the 5th seeded Jazz didn't *deserve* another allstar alongside Hayward.  
  
In 2018-19 Gobert had another incredible season culminating in a second DPOY and a second All NBA appearance. However he was once again controversially snubbed from the all-star game. Despite ranking in the top 3 in the league in win shares and dominating a tone of advanced defensive stats as well as leading the Jazz to another playoff appearance he missed out.  
 
In 2019-20 Gobert is currently the best player on a Utah Jazz team that currently holds the 3rd best record in the NBA. He's averaging 15 points and 15 rebounds and converting a crazy 68% of his field goal attempts. His defence has improved even more and he's become an even better perimeter defender. He also leads the league in dunks for a second consecutive season.  
  
Now there have been players like Lou Williams, Mike Conley and Jason Terry who have had longer careers and never made an All Star appearance. However I don't think there were any seasons where they were specifically ""snubbed"". More so they were great players just on the fringe of allstar level.  
  
So on that note what do you guys think? Some people may consider Gobert a lock but as a Jazz fan I'm still worried about another possibile snub. If anything he could miss due to Mitchell being a more entertaining player and the Jazz being deemed to not *deserve* two all-stars.

So is there something about the players and/or team construction that makes them particularly better than other teams at OT, or is it a statistically lucky streak of wins. 

My theory is 3 factors:

1. Team depth and health. A deep team is going to have more energy at the end of games.

2. Jimmy Butler. He has a reputation and personality for living for pressure moments. Some players are just made for big shots. Also team depth allows him to save his energy to close.

3. Luck. If a game goes to OT, it typically means that both teams were evenly matched, at least on that day. For a team to consistently take over evenly matched games 7 times there had to be at least some luck of making shots or luck of the opponent missing.

First I doubt that Detroit does this without significant picks coming back.
Second, Dallas might not be inclined to take on Drummond who may be a rental.
Lakers obviously get a two really good fits for just shipping trash.

As of today, we can comfortably say that the Bucks are winning the East, and that there are 5 teams with a decent shot at the 2 seed. Only 2.5 games separate MIA, TOR, BOS, PHI, and IND. 

The team with the easiest SOS is Miami, with the 5th easiest remaining schedule. With a combined winning % of .480, it's like they'll play the rest of the season against an opponent who has a projected record of 39.36-42.64. So, a team a shade better than 39 wins. Almost completely average. 

The team with the hardest SOS is Boston, facing a .507 SOS which projects to an opponent who would be 41.57-40.43. A team a shade better than 41 wins. In other words, almost completely average! 

With 37+ games remaining for most teams, this stat will almost always regress to the mean.

It seems to me that SOS really only matters when there a few games left, and/or the schedules are not balanced. With just a few games left, ofc we can see who has it easier, and by how much.

As a lifelong Pacers fan and relatively new NBA writer/podcaster, I’ve tried to avoid writing or speaking about Indiana in excess in order to maintain a non-biased and omniscient view of the league. However, Doug McDermott’s play and growth this year has not gotten enough praise, so I hope to shine some light on his season and impact for the Pacers.

At face value, McDermott’s stats don’t pop out at you, 10ppg/2.7rpg/1.1apg on 47% from the field and 44% from three, but he more than outplays statistics.

McDermott has been a plus shooter and a skilled offensive wing since entering the league in 2014, but this year he has become one of the most reliable offensive weapons for the Pacers. He’s gone from a good catch and shoot guy to a lethal specialist as the difficulty of his shots has increased without taking a hit on efficiency (He’s nearly eclipsed his career high in non-corner threes taken in only 44 games this season). 
He routinely runs a high screen handoff with Domantas Sabonis that leads to a quick release and almost always open look at 3.
This play has become a safety valve for one of the best bench units in the NBA (6.4 netRating). Doug works perfectly in tandem with Sabonis, routinely running dribble hand-offs leading to threes like the one above. That is an extremely difficult shot to take and make and is very reminiscent of the way we’ve seen Kyle Korver fly off screens since seemingly the NBA/ABA merger.

McDermott’s evolution into a more dynamic shooter has opened up other scoring avenues for him as well as the rest of the offense. The gravity of McDermott’s shooting, or the way his ability draws defenders, has elevated Indiana’s spacing to the tenth degree. Opposing players can’t afford to go under screens set for him and are forced to chase over them in order to try and prevent open shots. Sabonis is one of the top screen setters in the league, so this creates an incredibly hard to defend action in the offense. McDermott is getting to the rim at a higher rate than he ever has in his career and is finishing with regularity. He’s been incredible at reading the floor and quickly deciding whether to shoot or drive to the basket for an easier look.

McDermott lacks the physical tools to be a great defensive player, but he always scraps on that end and finds ways to come up with timely rebounds. He has quietly become one of the most impactful role players in the league and he’s such a joy to watch. There’s a grace in the way Doug runs off screens and releases the ball almost before the ball an even settle. He’s not going to throw down a 360, or swat a shot into the sixth row, but Doug McDermott is a winning player on a successful team, and more people need to know about it (He also should be in the three point contest but don’t get me started).

What do you think of McDermott and the Pacers? Who’s another player you love watching that seems to go unnoticed?

The general thought is pretty obvious: Philly has spacing issues. Embiid wants to play in the post, and is most effective there, but Simmons is a non-shooter from 3, and makes their spacing situation awkward.

Embiid and Simmons don't fit together. Embiid is the more accomplished player, so the discussion about trades has just assumed that Simmons would be the guy who got traded. But, with Embiid out of the lineup for the past couple of weeks, we have seen how effective he can be without Embiid clogging the paint. I'm not going to argue that Simmons is a better player than Embiid right now, but watching Simmons light it up got me thinking: what if Embiid were the one to be traded?

There are some solid reasons why it might make sense:

1. First and foremost, Embiid is undoubtedly injury prone. He missed the full first season after being drafted. When he made his NBA debut, he played 31 games his first season, 63 the second season, and 64 the third season. With his current injury, he doesn't look like he will hit 65 games played this season, either. When healthy, there is no doubt that Embiid is a beast. But, there are legitimate reasons to consider how long he will remain a beast for. Maybe Embiid stays healthy and is a beast for a long time more, but he's not too far from the age where Dwight Howard started to fall off.
2. Following up on the first point, Embiid has huge trade value. When healthy, he is one of the best centers in the league. His value is high, and you could get a huge trade haul for him. You could likely even do a superstar for superstar trade for him, and maybe replace him with someone who would fit alongside Simmons better than Embiid does.
3. Simmons arguably has a higher ceiling. He is two years younger, and is the inferior player right now, but Simmons is only 23, and he is probably about to make his second all star team. He is one of the most uniquely athletically gifted players in the league, with elite defence and elite court vision. He is obviously not remotely as good as Giannis, but he is a similar type of player (especially as compared to before Giannis learned to shoot the three), and he is not too far behind where Giannis was at age 23. And, Simmons is well ahead of where Giannis was in his 3rd season in the league (Giannis' first season was his age 19 season, while Simmons' was his age 21 season). Giannis was unlocked when they surrounded him with shooters, allowing him to use his physical gifts to slash to the paint, and use his excellent vision to dish to shooters. Giannis wasn't a competent three point shooter until this year. Simmons will almost certainly not reach Giannis' heights, because Giannis is at all-time great levels, but Simmons certainly has the potential to be a top 5 player in the league, if put in the right situation.

So, given all that, two questions:

1. Would you consider trading Embiid instead of Simmons?
2. If you did, what sort of deal would you be looking for?

I think if you did make a deal with Embiid, Philly would need to be getting a win-now star back, but I don't think it would be a center (because most of the top centers you could get would cause similar spacing issues). I think you would probably want to trade for a high level wing or shooting guard, who can shoot and be a secondary ball handler. Then, you would probably do a secondary deal to get a perimeter focused center, like a DeWayne Dedmon, who could shoot the three, and defend opposing centers.

Some guys that come to mind for potential deals, for the primary Embiid deal would be one of Boston's elite wings (Tatum or Brown), plus something like the Grizzlies pick they own. Bradley Beal plus other assets (although, this might end up as a three team trade, since Embiid on the Wizards seems to be less than ideal). Maybe a deal with OKC for SGA plus assets (crazy thought, what if Chris Paul and SGA were an option?). Maybe a trade with Dallas: Embiid for Porzingis plus assets?

# Introduction

Machine Learning models have been used to predict everything in basketball from the All Star Starters to James Harden’s next play. One model that has never been made is a successful Coach of the Year Predictor. The goal of this project is to create such a model.

Of course, creating such a model is challenging because, ultimately, the COY is awarded via voting and inherently adds a human element. As we will discover in this post, accounting for these human elements (e.g. recency bias, weighing storylines, climate around the team) makes it quite challenging. Having said this, I demonstrate how we can gain insight into what voters have valued in the past, allowing us to propose the most likely candidates quite accurately.

# Methods

## Data Aggregation

First, I created a database of all the coaches referred to in [Basketball Reference's coachs index](https://www.basketball-reference.com/coaches/)

Coach statistics were acquired from the following template url:

`f'https://www.basketball-
reference.com/leagues/NBA_{season_end_year}_coaches.html'`

Team statistics were acquired from the following template url:

`f'https://www.basketball-
reference.com/teams/{team_abbreviation}/{season_end_year}.html'` 

I leveraged the new [basketball-reference-scraper Python module](https://github.com/vishaalagartha/basketball_reference_scraper) to simplify the process.

After some data engineering that I describe completely in the [post](https://vishaalagartha.github.io/projects/2020/01/22/coy-predictor), I settled on the following features.

# Data Exploration

First, I computed the correlation between the COY label and all the other features and sorted them. Here are some of the top statistics that correlate with the award along with their Pearson correlation coefficient.
|Statistic|Pearson coefficient|
|--|--|
|CURRENT SEASON WINS|0.21764609944203592|
|SRS|0.20748396385759718|
|MOV|0.20740447792956693|
|NRtg|0.20613382194841318|
|PW|0.20282119218684597|
|PL|-0.19850434198291064|
|DRtg|-0.12967106743277185|
|ORtg|0.11896730313375109|

As expected, the one of the most important features appears to be CURRENT SEASON WINS.

It is interesting the PW and PL correlate so much. This correlation indicates that not only does performance matter, but **disparity between expected performance and reality** matters significantly as well.

The weight put towards SRS, MOV, and NRtg also provide insight into how the COY is selected. Apparently, not only does it matter whether a team wins or not, but it also matters **how** they win. For example, the Bucks are typically winning games at an average of ~13 ppg this year, which would heavily favor them.

The high weight toward [SRS](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/glossary.html#srs)(defined as a rating that takes into account average point differential and strength of schedule) indicates that it is even more important how a team performs against other challenging opponents. For example, no one should and does care about the Bucks crushing the Warriors, but they should care if they beat the Lakers.

Let's explore the CURRENT SEASON WINS statistic a little more using a box plot.

[Box Plot](https://imgur.com/5AN1PoM)

It appears coaches need to win ~50+ games for an 82 game season in order to be eligible. The exception being Mike Dunleavy’s minimum win season, there were only 50 games since it was a lockout season. Hence, that explains the outlier case.

Another interesting data point is the unfortunate coach who won the most games, but did not win the award. This turned out to be Phil Jackson, one year after his 72 win season in 1995-96 appeared to underperform by winning only 69 games. This, once again, indicates that the COY award takes into account historical performance. Who won instead? Pat Riley, with 61 wins.

Here are some histograms of the [MOV](https://imgur.com/XWiZ4oF) and [SRS](https://imgur.com/XUjVa8Z) where the blue plots indicate COY's and orange plots indicate NON-COY's.

As expected, COY’s are expected to dominate their teams and not just defeat them.

## Oversampling
Before we begin, there is one key flaw in our dataset to look into. Namely, the
two classes are not balanced at all. 

Looking into the counts we have 1686 non-COY's and 43 COY's (as expected).
This disparity can lead to a bad model, so how did I fix this?
 
### SMOTE Oversampling

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is a method of oversampling
to even the distribution of the two classes. SMOTE takes a random sample from
the minority class (`COY`=1 in our case) and computes it k-nearest neighbors. It
chooses one of the neighbors and computes the vector between the sample and the
neighbor. Next, it multiplies this vector by a random number between 0 and 1 and
adds the vector to the original random sample to obtain a new data point.

See more details [here](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume16/
chawla02a-html/chawla2002.html). 

## Model Selection and Metrics

For this binary classification problem, we'll use 5 different models. Each model had its hyperparameters fine tuned using Grid Search Cross Validation to provide the best metrics.
Here are all the models with a short description of each one:
* Decision Tree Classifier - with Shannon's entropy as the criterion and a maximum depth of 37.
* Random Forest Classifier - using the gini index as the criterion, maximum depth of 35 and maximum number of features of 5.
* Logistic Classifier - using the simple ordinary least squares method
* Support Vector Machine - with a linear kernel and `C=1000`
* Neural Network - a simple 6 layer network consisting of 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, 1 nodes, respectively (chosen to correspond with the number of features). I also used early stopping and 20% dropouts on each layer to prevent overfitting.

The metrics that will be used to evaluate our models are:
NOTE that: 
TP=True Positives (Predicted COY and was a COY), TN=True Negatives (Predicted Not COY and was Not COY), FP=False Positives (Predicted COY and was Not COY), FN=False Negatives (Predicted Not COY and was COY)

* Accuracy - % of correctly categorized instances
; Accuracy = (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)
* Recall - Ability to categorize (+) class (COY)
; Recall = TP/(TP+FN)
* Precision - How many of TP were correct
; Precision = TP/(TP+FP)
* F1 - Balances Precision and Recall
; F1 = 2(Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

# Results

| Model | Accuracy | Recall | Precision | F1|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|Decision Tree|0.963|0.977|0.952|0.964|
|Random Forest|0.985|0.997|0.974|0.986|
|Logistic|0.920|0.980|0.870|0.922|
|SVC|0.959|0.991|0.932|0.960|
|Neural Network|0.898|1.0|0.833|0.909| 
 
In terms of all metrics the Random Forest outperforms all. Moreover, the Random
Forest boasts an **extremely** high recall which is our most important metric.
When predicting the Coach of the Year, we want to be able to predict
the positive class best, which is indicated by a high recall. 

### Confusion Matrices

Confusion Matrices are another way of visualization our models' performances.
Confusion Matrices are nxn matrices where the columns represent the actual class
and the rows represent the class predicted by the model.

In the case of a binary classification problem, we obtain a 2x2 matrix with the
true positives (bottom right), true negatives (top left), false positive (top
right), and false negatives (bottom left). 

Here are the confusion matrices for the [Decision Tree](https://imgur.com/UZamMiB), [Random Forest](https://imgur.com/uXpns3Q), [Logistic Classifier](https://imgur.com/6DguzDK), [SVC](https://imgur.com/ZkINNAM), and [Neural Network](https://imgur.com/BKj9Tos).

Looking at the confusion matrices we can clearly see the disparity between the
Random Forest Classifier and other classifiers. Evidently, the Random Forest
Classifier is the best option. 
 
## Random Forest Evaluation

So what made the Random Forest so good? What features did it use that enabled it
to make such accurate predictions? 

I charted the feature importances of the Random Forest and plotted them in order [here](https://imgur.com/anguE7p).

Here are some explicit numbers:

|Feature|% Contribution|
|--|--|
|CURRENT SEASON WINS|6.569329857214043|
|SRS|6.368785568654217|
|PW|6.059094690243399|
|NRtg|5.5519116066060175|
|MOV|4.473122672559081|
|PL|3.643349558354282|
|...|...|

See more in my [blog post](https://vishaalagartha.github.io/projects/2020/01/22/coy-predictor).

I found it, once again, interesting that SRS such an important feature. It appears that the Random Forest took the correlation predicted earlier into account.

However, we see that other statistics matter significantly too, like CURRENT SEASON WINS, NRtg, and MOV as we predicted.

Something one wouldn’t anticipate is the contribution of factors outside of this season like FRANCHISE and CAREER features. Along these lines, one wouldn’t expect PW or PL to matter too much, but this model indicates that it is one of the most important features.

Let’s also take a look at where the random forest failed. If you recall from the confusion matrix, there was one instance where a COY was classified as NOT COY.

The point is the 1976 COY who was categorized as not COY. This individual
was coach [Bill Fitch of the 1975-76 Cleveland
Cavaliers](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CLE/1976.html). He had a
modest win record of 49-33 during an overall down year where the top record was
the 54-28 Lakers. Looking at the modern era where 60 win records and obscene
statistics are put up on a regular basis, I would say that this is not a
terrible error on our model's part.

The reason the model may have classified this as a NOT COY instance is due to
the fact that the team's statistics aren't all that impressive, but impressive
with respect to **THAT** year. This lack of incorporating other team
performances during the year may be the biggest flaw in our model. 

# Predicting the next Coach of the Year

Unfortunately, we do not have all the statistics for the current year, but we
will obtain what we can and modify the data as we did earlier.

Note that all our data is PER GAME, so for all of these statistics, we will just
use the PER GAME statistics up to this point (1/21/20)

The only unrealistic statistic is, then, CURRENT SEASON statistics. We will
assume CURRENT SEASON GAMES will be 82 for all coaches and obtain CURRENT SEASON
WINS from [538's ELO projections](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-nba-
predictions/) on 1/21/20.

Once again, all other stats were acquired via the
[`basketball_reference_scraper` Python
package](https://github.com/vishaalagartha/basketball_reference_scraper). 

|Team|Probability to win COY|
|--|--|
|MIL|0.49|
|TOR|0.46|
|LAC|0.36|
|BOS|0.31|
|HOU|0.23|
|LAL|0.22|

This shows the probability of each coach to win COY in the current season. Let's
take a look at each of the candidates in order:

**1) Milwaukee Bucks &amp; Mike Budenholzer (49%)**

Mike Budenholzer was the COY in the 2018-19 season and, objectively, the top
candidate for COY this year as well. The Bucks are on a nearly 70-win pace which
would automatically elevate him to the top spot.

However, the model is purely objective and fails to incorporate human elements
such as the fact that individuals look at the Bucks skeptically as a 'regular
season team'. Voters will likely avoid Budenholzer until there is more playoff
success.

Moreover, Budenholzer won last year and voters almost never vote for the same
candidate twice in a row. In fact, a repeat performance has never occurred in
the COY award.

We see here the flaw in the model to not weight the human elements of recency
bias against previous COY's and playoff success sufficiently.

**2) Toronto Raptors &amp; Nick Nurse (46%)**

The Raptors are truly an incredible story this year. No one expected them to be
this good. Even the ELO ratings put them at an expected 56 wins this season and
be tied for the 3rd best record in the league behind the Lakers and Bucks.

The disparity between what people expected of the Raptors and what has actually
transpired (despite injuries to significant players such as Lowry and Siakam)
indicates that Nurse would be a viable candidate for COY.

**3) Los Angeles Clippers &amp; Doc Rivers (36%)**

Despite the model favoring Doc Rivers, I believe it is unlikely that he wins COY
due to the current stories circulating around the Clippers.

Everyone came into the season expecting the Clippers to blow everyone out of the
water in the *playoffs*. No one expects the Clippers to exceed expectations
during the regular season, especially with their superstars Kawhi Leonard and
Paul George being the role models of load management.

**4) Boston Celtics &amp; Brad Stevens (31%)**

Brad Stevens is another likely candidate for the COY. Not ony are the Celtics
objectively impressive, but they also have the narrative on their side. After
last year's disappointing performance, people questioned Stevens, but their
newfound success without Kyrie Irving has pushed the blame onto Irving over
Stevens. Moreover, significant strides have been made by their young players
Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum vaulting them into Eastern Conference champion
contention.

**5) Los Angeles Lakers &amp; Frank Vogel (22%)**

Being in tune with the current basketball landscape through podcasts and
articles, I can tell that Frank Vogel's campaign for the COY is quite strong.
Over and over again we hear praises from players like [Anthony
Davis](https://heavy.com/sports/2020/01/lakers-anthony-davis-frank-vogel-
comments/) and [Danny Green on the recent Lowe
Post](http://www.espn.com/espnradio/podcast/archive/_/id/10528553) on how happy
the Lakers are.

With the gaudy record, spotlight and percolating positive energy around the
Lakers, Vogel is a very viable pick for the COY.

**6) Dallas Mavericks &amp; Rick Carlisle (22%)**

Tied with Vogel is Rick Carlisle and the Dallas Mavericks. The Dallas Mavericks,
along with the Raptors, are perhaps the most unexpected successful team this
season. Looking at their roster, no one stands out except for Porzingis and
Doncic, but they still tout a predicted record of 50-32.

Once again, the disparity between expectations and reality puts Carlisle in high
contention of the COY. 
 
# Conclusion

Overall, I'm quite pleased with the Random Forest model's metrics. The
predictions made by the model for the current 2019-20 appear on point as well.
The model appears to favor the disparity between what people expected of teams
and their performance on the court quite well. However, the flaw in the model is
the lack of weighing recent events properly as we saw with coach Budenholzer.

Once again, predicting the COY is a challenging task and we cannot expect the
model to be perfect. Yet, we can gain insight into what voters have valued in
the past, allowing us to propose the most likely candidates quite accurately.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,76197,public,self,[OC] Predicting the 2019-20 Coach of the Year,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/esgufy/oc_predicting_the_201920_coach_of_the_year/,,,,,,,,,,,

The direction the league has gone in is rather intriguing. Where each of these players rank on this scale shows that.

&amp;#x200B;

A little about this/me:

**-Have ranked every player in the league since November 2016**

**-I have created NBA content since 2005, essentially full-time since 2016.**

**-Wrote a 600+ page book this past offseason that had profiles for every player in the league and reviewed the 2018-2019 season**

**-Content on** r/nba **has gotten millions of views the last few years.**

**-Shortly before the season started, I was hired by a well-known NBA content platform. This season alone the content I've helped create has gotten close to 10,000,000 views.**

&amp;#x200B;

Putting this list together I want to be very clear that **every single player on this list was carefully reviewed over the past few days. All 484.** This was not something I just threw together.

&amp;#x200B;

***How I have put this list together over the years:***

*2016-2017:* Basic stats, reviewing box-scores

*2017-2018*: Same as before to start, but started watching extended highlights of all games in February 2018 and became a mix of basic stats + eye test.

*2018-2019:* Same as before but with more opinions from others. Created r/nbaranking and a committee of 37 people (including myself) created final ranking.

*This Year:* A damn roller-coaster. As mentioned before I was hired by an NBA content platform. This hiring was essentially a trial period at first however, so I also got another job managing about 25 employees for a local-chain.

This led to some 80-90 hour work weeks. Long story short the trial period was able to transition to full-time and I've been working as a full-time NBA writer and was able to leave my other job last month.

Although I put a list together in November, I really have been focusing on this list since last month for this year. I do feel now it is at the point to release. 

There will be an emphasis on watching games/analyzation of stats the last few months of the season but the biggest implementation this year has been **advanced stats/analytics.** Yes, unfortunately, I was one of those ""they don't really mean anything"".

On the platform I work for, we reached a point where we saw it necessary to include advanced stats/analytics a lot more in our work and the lessons learned have been astounding. The way a story can piece together about an individual player from using these methods has been a true eye-opener.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the list. **Due to this list being rather lengthy, I will not be adding individual explanations for this article. However, I will answer any and every question about the specific rankings in the comments.**

*Eligibility:* Any player who has played at all (i.e. Stephen Curry is eligible, Klay Thompson/Kevin Durant are not.) This made for example, ranking Gordon Hayward in 17-18 rather annoying. 

&amp;#x200B;

Will update/post list again in about a month after further feedback/evaluation

1st: Lebron/Harden/Giannis/AD/Jokic

2nd: Westbrook/Luka/Kawhi/Siakam/Gobert

3rd: Dame/Butler/PG/Sabonis/Embiid

&amp;#x200B;

Rationale for positions: LeBron is playing PG, no argument about that. The other two guards in the starting lineup: Bradley or Caldwell-Pope and Danny Green, almost never handle the ball. Luka is playing guard as well, for a similar reason. Jimmy is playing guard. Duncan Robinson and Meyers Leonard are the forwards in Miami's starting 5. Sabonis is starting next to Turner, who is definitely a center.

It allowed a team to amnesty a player, which meant waiving them and getting cap relief, but still paying their salary. It could only be used once, overall, only on contracts signed before 2011. While some teams squandered it (I cry at my hometown Knicks), I think it was helpful overall.

Recently, we've seen a problem with superstars trying to leave / make trade demands of their (often small market) team. I think the most important factor here is allowing teams to build a proper team without being shacked by mistakes of the past. In some cases, stars will just sour on the front office (eg Kawhi), but in others, the decision to leave is because the front office cannot put a good team around you (Davis, potentially KAT).

Bringing back the amnesty clause, but where teams can amnesty one player a year, would help small market teams who had to overpay a subpar player to tread water. Players should be okay with it as well because they won't be losing money with this bargain. With the amnesty clause, the Timberwolves could jet Wiggins, who is a negative trade asset, and try to sign complementary pieces. Same could have been said for New Orleans, who could have dropped some of their overpaid players and built a better team around AD. 

One issue with an idea like this is that big market teams get an advantage because they're more willing to spend money to build a better team.

Addendum: Bar an amnestied player from playing in the NBA. If they want to play again, they forfeit their amnesty salary.

This takes away some power from the player, but it encourages player and team to find a buyout instead of a simple amnesty. Chris Paul would not want to sit out a season just to get the bag. I'm not sure how happy players would be, but I think it's a good balance.

The follow-up is that big markets get relatively less valuable in this setup. Players don't want to sign a contract only to be amnestied, so they may take a smaller contract with a small market team to avoid the situation. Most of them probably like playing the game, and wouldn't give that up for their salary.

Option: Another thing to consider is how many players a team can amnesty in a year. We don't want teams to rehaul their while roster, but it would be expensive to amnesty too many players anyway.

Tl;dr Amnestying a player is forgiving their contract from the cap while still playing them. Teams could use this to build better teams, unconstrained by the cap, and keep their superstars happy for longer. My own addendum is that amnestied players forfeit their salary if they want to play in the NBA again, so there is encouragement for buyouts and big market teams get their spending power checked.

Hey everyone - based on the reporting from ESPN’s Andrew Lopez and Baxter Holmes along with comments from Pels GM David Griffin and Zion himself - I detailed Zion's extended rehab &amp; retraining program including how the team may have modified Zion’s knee alignment (aka avoiding knee valgus), jumping &amp; landing mechanics, running gait analysis, eccentric control, and key factors when assessing carry-over of those new patterns into actual games. Here's the video roadmap:

If this post sucks (high likelihood), it's because I do in fact, suck at this.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

It's about halfway into the season so I thought this might be a good time to crunch some numbers.  The purpose of this exercise was to determine which statistical factors on Giannis's game logs were most conducive to Wins.  I'd also like to point out that the data pool is a little small, especially the losses (which have been rare for the Bucks this year) so expect some error.

&amp;#x200B;

I used Basketball Reference and [NBA.com](https://NBA.com) to create 2 separate pools of data to run some statistical models on.  I ran a Random Forest Classifier to see which statistical elements the computer thought were most important to predicting Wins, and created some scatterplots and a couple of Linear Regression Plots of some of the more interesting stats.

&amp;#x200B;

From Basketball Reference, here are the statistical categories used in the Random Forest: 'FG', 'FGA', 'FG%', '3P', '3PA', '3P%', 'FT', 'FTA', 'FT%', 'ORB', 'DRB', 'TRB', 'AST', 'STL', 'BLK', 'TOV', 'PF', 'PTS'

&amp;#x200B;

\[Here is the Pie Chart for how heavily the computer weighed each category when predicting Wins\]([https://i.imgur.com/4xHdEuD.png](https://i.imgur.com/4xHdEuD.png))

&amp;#x200B;

3PT% came out at a whopping 37.5%.  After some calculations, it turns out that when the Bucks win Giannis shoots 35.58% from three, and a measley 8.3% during losses.  I don't think this really comes at a surprise that he shoots 35% during wins, he and the Bucks are essentially unstoppable when he's hitting from downtown.  The 8.3% on losses however was mildly interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

\[Here's a graph showing the relationship between 3PT% and the Win/Loss Margin\]([https://i.imgur.com/8vT9eqG.png](https://i.imgur.com/8vT9eqG.png)).  Orange dots are wins, and blue dots are losses.

&amp;#x200B;

\[Here's the relationship between Plus/Minus and Minutes Played\]([https://i.imgur.com/Dk4QLWQ.png](https://i.imgur.com/Dk4QLWQ.png)).  No surprise here, when Giannis has a high Plus Minus he tends to get less minutes.  It might also show that when Giannis sits, the Bucks are putting in work to help him stay out of games.

&amp;#x200B;

\[Here's another unsurprising graph of the relationship between Points and Plus Minus.\]([https://i.imgur.com/HfB5Jet.png](https://i.imgur.com/HfB5Jet.png))  That loss near the bottom right was a 48 point effort against Dallas.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to see if there was a \[relationship between Assists, Plus Minus and Wins\]([https://i.imgur.com/FXe1pCq.png](https://i.imgur.com/FXe1pCq.png)), and there didn't seem to be much correlation here.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly from BBall Reference, here's the relationship between \[3PT Attempts and 3P%\]([https://i.imgur.com/44snBdk.png](https://i.imgur.com/44snBdk.png)).  I made the dots transparent to show redundant points.  Dots that are looking gray/black are where both losses and wins coincide.  This data was all over the place, not much here I think.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, moving on to [NBA.com](https://NBA.com) for some more advanced stats.  I wanted to do something with their hustle stats, but I couldn't find a way to see them game to game, so I went with their advanced scoring metrics.  The statistical categories used here were: '%FGA 2PT', '%FGA 3PT', '%PTS 2PT', '%PTS 2PT MR', '%PTS 3PT','%PTS FBPS', '%PTS FT', '%PTS OFFTO', '%PTS PITP', '2FGM %AST','2FGM %UAST', '3FGM %AST', '3FGM %UAST', 'FGM %AST', 'FGM %UAST'.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the \[Pie Graph showing what stats the computer thought were most important when predicting Wins\]([https://i.imgur.com/VVp29i4.png](https://i.imgur.com/VVp29i4.png)).  

&amp;#x200B;

It's a bit more evenly distributed here, but looks like the winner here is Percentage of Points as 2PTers coming in at 23.4%.  Another 2 pointer related stat comes in second, 2PT FG made that were unassisted (15.6%).  Points in the paint coming in third (10.6%) and interestingly Percentage of Points as 3PTers came in fourth (8.9%).

&amp;#x200B;

So, the data from BBall Reference showed that 3PTers were most predictive of wins, but the advanced scoring metrics from [NBA.com](https://NBA.com) seemed to disagree.  So I plotted some graphs.

&amp;#x200B;

First, here's the \[relationship between Minutes Played and % of PTS as 2Pters\]([https://i.imgur.com/hELpbaQ.png](https://i.imgur.com/hELpbaQ.png)).  Notice those losses at the top right?  The correlation of losses crosses with these 2 categories isn't the strongest, but there is a distinct absence of losses the closer to the lower left you get. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, out of curiosity, I plotted \[the same plot, but with % of PTS as 3PTers\]([https://i.imgur.com/zi4bgzz.png](https://i.imgur.com/zi4bgzz.png)).  From this it looks like the more minutes Giannis plays, the higher the percentage of his shots that will be 2PTers.  It's not surprising that the losses are clustered the higher the minutes go because those are the closer games, but it certainly looks like the data from BBall reference is getting a little validation here.

&amp;#x200B;

Just for shits I thought I'd check \[the linear regression of Minutes and %of 3PTers\]([https://i.imgur.com/SmfD5q8.png](https://i.imgur.com/SmfD5q8.png)) and it does show a slightly downward slope, although from the shaded blue area there does seem to be some error.  

&amp;#x200B;

So I decided to plot that same graph, \[but separating the data from Wins and Losses\]([https://i.imgur.com/gCmXCAI.png](https://i.imgur.com/gCmXCAI.png)).  As you can see from the shaded orange area, the error is reduced for Wins because there was simply more data points to train the computer with.  

&amp;#x200B;

Here is that same \[graph separated by Wins, but with % of PTs as 2PTers)\[[https://i.imgur.com/zMebhnW.png](https://i.imgur.com/zMebhnW.png)\].  As you can see, it is the inverse relationship from the %of3PTers data.  

&amp;#x200B;

For the West, I honestly think Denver can easily carve out an easy way to the WCF barring they run into either LA teams beforehand. Denver is currently sitting at a 3-way tie for 2nd place in the West with the Jazz and the Clippers. While Jokic is having a down year, if him as well as Murray can turn it up in April, I wouldn't be surprised if they really made the WCF and gave the Lakers some serious issues. The recent play of MPJ has been great as he's slowly playing his way into a starting role, and other role players like Beasley and Grant can hurt any team if not accounted for. This team is one of the more complete teams in the league and will probably have the best chemistry in the West come playoff time as they're one of the few teams with continuity.

Another team that I would be on the lookout for is the Thunder as they could possibly advance to the 2nd round if they play a weaker top 3-4 seed. This team is built perfectly for Donovan as he excels in coaching team-ball rather than stars with egos. The 3-guard trio of CP3, SGA and Schroeder has been lethal as teams haven't been able capitalize on poor backup guard play that most teams possess. All three can really control the offense and score which poses an issue for teams in crunch time when they have to deal with 3 shifty guards as well as Gallinari who can get red-hot at times. Adams has proven to be a great anchor, and it seems like they're on the trend upwards.

As for the East, I may share the same opinion with many of you guys as I seriously believe the Pacers can upset anyone in the East not named the Milwaukee Bucks. It's assumed that Oladipo will take upwards 2-3 months to return to his previous form (if possible), and could take even longer. Despite the rust, the Pacers are only 2.5 games behind the 2nd seeded Heat, with Sabonis and Brogdon showing serious All-Star Potential, along with their deep bench of shooters and playmakers, I seriously think they could replicate what they did against the Cavaliers in 2018 and make it past the 1st round to give a top seed some trouble, but at that point I don't know if they could realistically make it past the 2nd round if they play Milwaukee or even Philly, but if they play a team like Toronto, I can see a ECF berth for Indiana, which is weird to say since it isn't 2013 anymore.. This team is similar to Denver and OKC, in terms of their overall solidness.

Philly doesn't scare me because it's too easy to muck up their offense and no East team has a second star that really overwhelms Giannis' own greatness (a la a Kawhi Leonard). The Clippers actually scare me more than the Lakers, but I don't really feel like their is a team that we couldn't beat in a 7 game series.

With a win percentage of 0.810, they are currently on pace to finish with an approximate record of 67-15. I acknowledge that this pace could change with injuries or if the Lakers decide to ease off their stars before the playoffs.

**Preseason expectations:** Prior to the NBA season starting, the Lakers were perceived as clearly improved thanks to the acquisition of Anthony Davis. There seemed to be a lot more skepticism, however, about the rest of the team outside of Lebron and AD, which led to general pre-season consensus  that the Lakers would be a solid, but not dominant nor leading, team in the West. The Clippers, along with the Rockets, Nuggets, and sometimes Jazz, would typically appear above the Lakers in pre-season predictions in the West--throw in the Bucks and Sixers from the east when doing full-league rankings. 

Some example predictions from the pre-season:

* [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27426015/nba-preseason-predictions-our-experts-picks-2019-20) predicted the Lakers to finish 5th in the West and 7th overall with a record of 51-31. 
* [Bleacher Report](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2789744-2018-19-nba-schedule-win-loss-predictions-for-every-team#slide14) predicted the Lakers to have a record of 44-38.
* [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-nba-predictions/?ex_cid=rrpromo) predicted (scroll to bottom and select Oct. 22 ""Final Preseason"" prediction) the Lakers to be 7th most likely to win the Finals at 3% and to have a record of 48-34. As of Jan 22, 2020, they now give Lakers the biggest chance of winning the finals at 26% and predict they will have a record of 62-20. 
* [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/21/sports/basketball/nba-predictions-season.html) sports writers' predictions for Conference and League Finals all omitted the Lakers (save one Conference Finals prediction).

Obviously, there is the second half of the season to go, but my point here is that *if* the Lakers were currently playing to expectations you would've expected them to show up more often in the top end of pre-season predictions. Not to mention, the Lakers are currently on pace to significantly bypass preseason predictions of their record by 15-20 wins. And it is not as if the Lakers have changed parts of their roster since these predictions came out.

They are even allowed to structure a trade in a way that the other teams would not be allowed to accept. All that matters is that they acquire players in an allowed manner - the way in which the other team(s) acquire the traded away players is handled separately by the acquiring team.

There are two types of trades: simultaneous and non-simultaneous. Simultaneous trades can aggregate any number of players on each side of the trade, so long as you are acquiring no more than 125% of the salary you give up, plus $100k. The first half of a non-simultaneous trade can only get rid of *exactly one* player, and doing so grants a one-year right to trade for one or more players with a combined salary of up to $100k + the departing player's salary.

So, for this instance, we'll take a look at a potential Mavericks/Timberwolves trade. [Covington + Dieng for Lee + Jackson + Brunson](https://tradenba.com/trades/o7VjisV7U). It's interesting to me because both teams can structure the deal differently, allowing the Wolves to start a non-simultaneous trade.

The Mavericks side of things is pretty straightforward: Dieng (16.2m) gets acquired by trading away Lee (12.7m), Jackson (3.2m), and Brunson (1.4m) in a simultaneous trade. Covington (11.3m) fits neatly into the remaining Traded Player Exception (11.8m) from the Mavs' previous Barnes trade.

On the Wolves side, they're flipping things. Lee (12.7m) and Brunson (1.4m) are still acquired in a simultaneous trade, but this is for Covington (11.3m), not Dieng. This barely fits under the 125% + $100k, and leaves a salary mismatch for the non-simultaneous half of things: acquire Jackson (3.2m) for Dieng (16.2m), granting a future TPE to acquire up to 13.1m worth of players. The Mavs don't have an exception to acquire Dieng for Jackson, but this is completely irrelevant since the teams need only find *a* justification for their acquisitions, not *the same* justification as their trade partners.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,76038,public,self,The CBA's rules for traded player salary-cap exceptions are weirder than you think.

I want to discuss when you think this tournament should take place. I think the biggest factor is what is happening in the NFL during each time. There are a few options in my opinion, each with pros and cons.

Option 1 - December, ending on Christmas. 

Pros: Christmas is already the NBA's marquee regular season day

Cons: Very early, NBA would want to schedule games for Christmas, during the end of the NFL regular season so you'd get no coverage in national or in most local stations (for example, the Broncos will get priority coverage even if the Nuggets are doing great in the tourny)

Thoughts: This is a pretty awful idea, the only reason it is thrown around is because the NBA already owns Christmas. 

Option 2- January 

Pros: NBA teams have play their 41st game in January so it is very much in the middle, most NFL teams are already out of the playoffs so local markets can focus on NBA if their team is doing well

Cons: The NFL playoffs will overshadow you (for example, Cowherd and Skip Bayless and people like that will talk 90% NFL)

Option 3- February right after the Superbowl

Pros: NFL season is over, not much sports competition (NHL regular season, XFL, eventually MLB and MLB, March Madness possibly)

Cons: Kinda late in the year, NBA already gets much of the media attention this time of year so it could be seen as pointless

Graham is having a (for the most part) unexpectedly excellent sophomore year, and upon a cursory look of his [BBall Ref page](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/grahade01.html), a pretty interesting one:

1. **Few players have been as good as Graham while also struggling to convert 2s** - Despite having a strong year scoring-wise, (90th percentile usage, 55th percentile points/shot per [Cleaning the Glass](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4428#tab-offensive_overview), Graham has an abysmal 36.4 2P%. [Here's a list of player seasons](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;per_poss_base=100&amp;type=advanced&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=0&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;qual=mp_per_g_req&amp;c1stat=fg2_pct&amp;c1comp=lt&amp;c1val=.37&amp;order_by=bpm) with 2P% &lt;37%. As you can see, there've been very productive seasons with a % inside the arc that low and even fewer by a player similar to Graham. Brandon Jennings' rookie year is the closest analog.  

2.  **Graham's shot profile looks more like a low usage, off-ball wing than an on-ball shot creator** - The reason why Graham has been really good this year despite converting shots inside the arc at such a low rate is because he's not only an excellent 3 pt shooter (38.7 3P%), but also a prolific one. -- 60.6% of his shots come from behind the arc. That strikes me as a pretty high amount for a point guard, who, as you'd expect creates his own buckets (only 29.6% of his 2s and 53.1% of his 3s are assisted). Sure enough, when you look at [a list of guards this year who take &gt;60% of shots from 3](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;per_poss_base=100&amp;type=advanced&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;year_min=2020&amp;year_max=2020&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=0&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;qual=mp_per_g_req&amp;c1stat=fg3a_per_fga_pct&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=.60&amp;order_by=bpm), there aren't many, if any, players like Graham who pop up. Patty Mills I guess? Otherwise the results are all pretty much off-ball wing types. 

3. **Despite his shot profile, Graham creates a lot of shots for others, uniquely so** - Despite taking such a high amount of 3s, Graham still creates a high amount of shots for his teammates, evidenced by an AST% of 35.5, 95th percentile among combo guards per [Cleaning the Glass](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4428#tab-offensive_overview). Only 2 other players in NBA history have had years with a similar 3PAr/AST% combo: late career Jason Kidd and Kyle Lowry the last two seasons. While this is skewed by the the 3 point revolution, I still find it pretty interesting. 

***

I mean this post more as a descriptive assessment than a qualitative one, but I still came away feeling even more bullish about Graham than before. His ability to take threes off the dribble at a high volume and make them at a high % is scheme changing. Add on his ability to create for others, and that's a very dangerous offensive player.  Frankly, in theory it could give him star or near star-level impact if he cleans up the rest of his game. Plus/Minus is very noisy of course, but I don't think it's entirely a coincidence that his is +8.2 per 100. I know he's 24, but I wonder if he should be getting even more attention and we should be discussing his ceiling more. 

Of course, ""if he cleans up the rest of his game"" is key. As stated above, his profile (so bad on 2s, very dependent on 3s) is really unique for his archetype. I think there is a reason why that's so -- it's hard to put pressure on a defense and generally be an on-ball creator like that. So you have to wonder if it's sustainable. I'm inclined to think it mostly is (41 career 3P% in college on high volume), but it gives him very little margin for error and it's essential that he gets better at 2s (not necessarily take more). 

Will he? Considering his level of talent and how bad he is at 2s, I'd think he has to get better there. But he is already 24, and his track record in college inside the arc isn't great: 

**Season** | FG% At-Rim | FG% 2pt Jumpers
:-- | :-- | :--
**14-15** | 42.9 | 33.3
**15-16** | 55.9 | 42.9
**16-17** | 70.2 | 33.8
**17-18** | 44.0 | 34.2

So I have no idea. But, if nothing else, Graham is a unique player, legitimately really good (*not* a good stats/bad team guy), and if he improves inside the arc, could have a much higher ceiling than most people give him credit for.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,75991,public,self,The Uniqueness of Devonte' Graham,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/er3pqp/the_uniqueness_of_devonte_graham/,,,,,,,,,,,[]

I recently went into a debate with a Utah fan, in what seemed to be a Gobert appreciation thread. I was of the opinion, that in no way would Jazz leave a chance to swap Gobert straight up with KAT. I didn't mean to make that comment, but it just came out in the context of the conversation. Fair to say, I was met with vehement opposition.

That made me think, was I really that wrong here? I evaluated KAT to be the 3rd best among young players(After Giannis and Luka) after in both play and value. Every team should kill to have him.

Discuss.

Edit: He has improved with each passing season, and I believe this season's iteration of KAT, if healthy, could influence and win games like Luka and Giannis.

So the first question:

1. Should Portland move on from Lillard? Leaving all emotions aside, I think yes they should shop Dame around RIGHT NOW when his value is at an all time high. Portland fans may hate management for doing so, but sometimes you have to trade your icon away (eg. Toronto trading Demar)

This is where people may disagree, but personally I see Portland going nowhere in the next few years. If they keep Dame and CJ they will continue to be good, but just middle of the pack, 2nd round at best like they have been the last 5 years (except for getting lucky last year). Anybody not from Portland should admit there's no way the Blazers were 2nd best in the west last year. The real WCF was GSW (with KD healthy for 5 games)  vs HOU in the 2nd round, Blazers got lucky with the seeding. IMO last year was their one shot, they dodged the #1 and #2 teams in the 2nd round, and still got swept by GSW without KD. 

And then they let all Aminu, Harkless, Curry, and Leonard walk. Yes they've had some injuries this season but clearly the team is much worse than it was last year, practically losing all their wing defense. Many people on this thread speculate that maybe the Blazers could land Kevin Love or Aldridge, but IMO neither of those moves puts POR above LAL, LAC, HOU, and next year GSW with Steph, and Klay back. 

Two years from now I think the convo will come up anyway about moving on from Dame and CJ, so better to trade one of them now rather than 2 years too late (eg. OKC with Russ, CLE letting King James walk without trading him in 2018). I made a post about this before but do people realize Dame will be making $49M a year? Idc how loyal and iconic he is in Portland, there are no basketball reasons that he should be making $9M more than Steph Curry. That contract (knock on wood) is one injury away from being an albatross- and at present I don't see how Portland improves their roster paying one guy that much. 

2. What trade destination, if any, makes sense?

I say trading for Ben Simmons + picks and maybe other filler is a win win. Philly is in win now mode and Lillard would be a great fit. He's a lethal scorer from any distance, will give Tobias and J Rich more space, and lets Embiid play in the paint. Philly also has a great defense to cover for Dame. All quite self explanatory why Philly does this trade. 

As for Portland, idk what the throw ins should be, but Simmons to me has a higher ceiling than what Lillard currently is. Lillard is undoubtedly a better player now but I think Simmons can be Giannis- lite. He needs a new environment where he's the number 1 option and somebody forcing him to work on his damn shot. Maybe I'm higher on Simmons than most but I think he could break out, like when Harden went to Houston, or Ingram going to NOP. Regardless, Simmons is much younger and would give Portland a longer window to surround him with pieces. They'll be worse in the short term, but like I said I don't think they would have contended the next few years anyway. Hell, they might not even make the playoffs this year. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even if you want to say I'm delusional and way too optimistic on Simmons, I still believe Portland should try something new. No offense to Dame and CJ but they are just the discount splash bros and won't lead Portland to a title (or even possibly another conference final). I really think they should pull a Toronto, fans will get over it in a few years.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,75966,public,self,Should Portland blow it up?

workshopping a trade for the deadline season. What do you guys think of this? Gordon Hayward and Semi Ojeleye for Paul Millsap and Malik Beasley. I think this helps both teams. 

The Celtics get more touches for the Jay's and Millsap gives them a veteran presence, frontcourt depth, and an excellent spot-up shooter. Beasley is a restricted FA after this season that the Nuggets are unlikely to keep. The Celtics would get a look at him and a chance to match any contract. Overall, this trade balances out the Celtics roster, and gives them some quality floor spacers that will make life easier for the core players

Nuggets have Jerami Grant to fill in at PF and Hayward should be a great fit for the Nuggets system. He is an elite cutter who should play well off of Jokic and he can help run the offense in the half-court.

Denver Nuggets guard Gary Harris is a key part of Denver’s rotation, likely an All-Defense candidate, and a quality all-around player. He’s having a solid season in his 6th year putting up 11ppg/2.8rpg/2.2apg on 42.1% fg/31.6% 3p/82.3% FT while routinely guarding the opposing team’s best guard.

However, a few years ago, I and many others were watching Harris emerge as a potential All-Star on the young rebuilding Nuggets.

Just two seasons ago in 2017/18, Harris was an efficient 3-level scoring monster who at age 23, was posting 17.5ppg/2.6rpg/2.9apg shooting 48.5% from the field and 39.6% from three on nearly six attempts per game.

I’m not writing this to nitpick and tear down Harris as a player. I really just want to dive into what’s happened in his career and figure out how this has happened and speculate as to whether or not we’ll see Harris return to his previous form.

One of the primary reasons for his drop in play is more than likely injury. Since Harris became a full-time starter in his second season, Harris has played in only 294 of 414 possible games, missing 29% of all games played. He has been routinely plagued by a myriad of injuries for long stretches of the past three seasons. This in turn seems to have really taken a hit on Harris’ ability to finish at the rim. In his peak year (17/18) Harris shot 69% at the rim which for a guard and frankly any player, is phenomenal. His ability to finish there regressed to 58% last year and while he’s gotten back to a respectable 62%, he’s still miles off where he was.

However, the most startling decline has been Gary’s jumpshot. While his ability to hit corner three’s has remained constant, his shot accuracy above the break has fallen off a cliff. Harris shot 39% (118/299) on non-corner threes, last year he dropped to 32% (54/169), and this season he has plummeted to 26% (28/109). This drop is MASSIVE and not in a good way. Harris’ catch and shoot attempts have decreased the past two years (4.4 to 2.9) and while his pull up attempts from three have stayed roughly the same (1.4 attempts/game) his efficiency on those have dropped from 34% to 25.5% over the past two seasons.

The emergence of other guards/wings in Denver has also likely played a factor, but I believe the way in which his game has been impacted is due to his injuries. He’s struggled with lower body injuries throughout the past few years, most notably a hip injury. I watch a lot of Denver, but haven’t noticed any real change in his jumper, but I’d go out on a limb and say he’s probably getting less lift on his shot.

He’s been banged up slightly this year, but he’s on pace to play his highest number of games since his second season. Harris turned 25 just before this season started, in year six of his career , and if he is going to fully develop in the way he showed, it’s going to happen sooner rather than later as he approaches his prime. I fully believe in Harris to still grow as a player and that if Denver is going to maximize their potential, his development is instrumental.

Once again, I cannot stress enough the quality of Harris as a player now. If he doesn’t return to those near all-star levels, I don’t put that on him at all. Sports are a bitch, you fight everyday, putting insane stress on your body that it isn’t meant to go through. Injuries are very real and devastating. More often it is the smaller quiet ailments that build up and derail a career over time, rather than the sudden destructive injury that’s visualized in film and TV.

I hope to see Gary healthy and thriving in Denver soon and wish him nothing but the best.

Zach Lowe put it best:

&gt;
There are three theoretical Gordons: the player Gordon wants to be; the player Orlando wants him to be; and the player Orlando needs him to be because of their roster construction. The actual Gordon is paralyzed in some sort of existential tension between all three.

The first player -- Gordon's dream for himself -- is a ball-dominant scorer. Orlando indulges that Gordon by calling occasional post-ups for him and giving him some freedom to go rogue. Gordon can make hay against smaller players. He has done well on scripted duck-ins. But too many of his forays into would-be stardom end with bricked fadeaways:

A player this powerful should not spend so much time spinning away from the hoop. He rarely draws fouls. The Magic have scored 0.826 points per possession anytime Gordon shoots out of a post-up or passes to a teammate who fires right away -- 74th among 96 players who have recorded at least 25 post-ups, per Second Spectrum data. He is not much of an inside-out playmaker. A full 77% of those post-ups have ended with Gordon shooting -- the second highest such rate in that sample.

The best version of Gordon on a good team is something like his take on Draymond Green: screening and rolling as a power forward, spraying passes (Gordon is an underrated playmaker), defending like all hell across every position. The Magic have never put Gordon in optimal position to find that role. They shoehorned him onto the wing next to Serge Ibaka and now Jonathan Isaac.


Personally I think the Celtics should do what it takes to get him on the roster as he'd be a great versatile slashing 4, who can play small ball 5 and play great defense. 

I think a deal the Celtics can put together is Gordon Hayward and the Memphis pick or Romeo Langford  for AG and Evan Fournier. 

It's tricky trying to trade for someone who has so much potential but is in a system that doesn't properly utilize.

Gives both teams time to get more info on their situations for the rest of the year before Caris LeVert's extension kicks in which brings the salary differential down to just +1.8m for Gordon. 

Reasons for Brooklyn: Starting line up of Kyrie/Harris/KD/Gordon/Jordan or Allen. 

Kyrie has the gravity in the pick and roll to give Gordon 4 on 3 situations with 2 above average shooters and a capable lob threat. Coupled with the isolation scoring of Kyrie/KD, and Dinwiddie leading the bench, that could be a championship level offense even if KD only gets back to 80%. 

Defensively, Gordon is very switchable and capable. Not sure of the ceiling on his defensive upside, but he's good in a lot of situations. Maybe this line up is championship quality on defense, maybe not, but Gordon makes it closer than LeVert does.

Reasons for Orlando:

Starting line up: Fultz/LeVert/Fournier/Isaac/Vucevic

The Isaac/Gordon fit is a little bit clunky next to Fultz (who has certainly been good enough for the Magic to consider him a foundational piece). Given that Fultz isn't a good shooter, it doesn't make sense to build a team around the idea he will be if it isn't necessary. Leveraging Fultz's slashing ability and vision by getting a competent shooter in LeVert to go with Fournier and Terrence Ross will not only help take advantage of Fultz's definite strengths, but create more room for Vucevic as well.

It isn't clear if this Orlando team is really all the way there, but they aren't bad enough to get lottery picks high enough to likely yield top end talent that really fundamentally changes their situation. Gordon for the next 2 years is their most movable asset and source for positional redundancy with Isaac prospering at the 4. Maybe the most realistic path for the Magic off the treadmill is getting a guy to help the team take the chance Fultz and Isaac can become an an all-nba level players. Is it the most likely outcome? Is it the most realistic for the Magic?

This collection of talent reminds me of the young core OKC had at the beginning of last decade. Now, that team never won a title, but they certainly could have. Does anyone else see this team contending for a title in the future?

Obviously he's not a great leader, based on what he's been saying for a while now I think it's safe to say he's pretty dumb as well, although it seems he regards himself some kind of a genius or a big figure. How LeBron managed to hide this fact completely is maybe one of his bigger accomplishments lol. He's clearly not a leader but I'm getting sidetracked.

How good is Kyrie really? His finishing is elite (or is it?), he's shooting 39% from 3PT on 5.4 FGA (career), is a solid fascilitator. His offensive skillset is complete with a great midrange game as well. We all know how good his handle is, one of the best in the history of basketball, maybe even the best; talent-wise he's great. However, maybe we're overestimating his value as a player because of this? 

He's definitely not top10, at least imo. Guys that are better than him beyond reasonable doubt (in no particular order):

Giannis, LeBron, Kawhi, KD, Curry, AD, PG, Embiid, Harden - all self-explanatory really, that's 9.

Luka Doncic - he's already an elite playmaker, averaraging a near-triple double, with a whole array of offensive skills and size to help him on the defensive end as well. His 3PT% is low (\~32%) mostly because of the difficulty of shots he attempts from there. He turns the ball over a fair bit 9A/4.4TO to Kyrie 7A/2.2 but he controls the offense similarly to LeBron, whose turnovers are at 3.7. For his usage on the offensive end he still takes care of the ball very well and is way superior a playmaker to Kyrie, that much is obvious. He carries one of the best offenses in the history of the league. 

He's finishing way better than Kyrie - an insane 61% on 9.4 FGA inside 10ft vs 52.7% on 7.9 FGA 

[https://stats.nba.com/players/shots-general/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PlayerPosition=G&amp;GeneralRange=Less%20Than%2010%20ft&amp;sort=FG2A&amp;dir=1](https://stats.nba.com/players/shots-general/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PlayerPosition=G&amp;GeneralRange=Less%20Than%2010%20ft&amp;sort=FG2A&amp;dir=1)

Going over this and last season's stats leads me to believe I overvalued Kyrie as a finisher. He's definitely flashy and extremely skillful, but not super efficient, or at least he doesn't stand out. Yes he is undersized compared to some, but DeRozan, Harden, Rose or even Russ, Ja and Luka (already) are better this season, some of them significantly.

Defensively I still regard Kyrie as an average defensive player. He's improved under Stevens, maybe he's a very small plus on that end. His defensive rating is way up this season to 113 but it will probably decrease, small sample size. He may be better than Luka but I still think Doncic is a better player already, although only 20.

So that's the top 10 for me.

Jokić had a slow start, but has been improving greatly. He was a top10 player last season, with KD and Curry out he's a top10 this season. I think his value to a team is bigger than Kyrie, his impact on the Nuggets is huge. I also take Lillard over Kyrie, although it's hella close. He can lead a team, and so far Kyrie proved he can be a great sidekick, but no more than that. 12.

After that it's very close. Is Kyrie better than Gobert, Siakam, Butler, KAT, underappreciated Klay? I'm not much of a stathead and it'd take a lot of effort and digging to back that up or not. They are for sure better on the defensive end which makes it tough to compare as there is no metric, no matter how advanced, that takes everything into equation. I'm sure I missed someone but well.

I think he's better than the likes of Kemba, Russ, Simmons, Oladipo (this Pacers-Cavs series though) but I'm not sure I'm comfortable saying Kyrie is a top15 player even though he was All-NBA 2nd team last year.

Towns has missed over a month with a mysterious injury. A conspiracy theorist might suggest he's sitting out until the Wolves improve the roster around him - getting rid of Teague, who didn't feed Towns enough, was step 1.

The Wolves are rumored to be intensifying their pursuit of Russell, following the Crabbe trade. They also own all their future draft picks.

If the Wolves trade Leyman, Crabbe, and first rounders for D-Lo, each team gains the following:

Wolves: make a push for the playoffs, keep Towns happy, have a clear core heading into 2020-2021. This trade puts them at 13 players on their roster, so they also have a lot of flexibility to potentially make another trade in the next two weeks, or add a buyout guy.

Warriors: clear $5.1M in payroll, allowing them to duck the luxury tax this year, which also saves them a repeater tax bill of $15M this season but more importantly delays the repeater tax in future seasons as everyone's salary goes up. Warriors also slightly increase the likelihood that they finish dead last in the standings this season, ensuring a top-5 pick. More importantly of course, they get the Minny future first-round picks.

How good do these first-round picks need to be to entice the Warriors to do this? Minny could trade their 2020, 2022, 2024, and 2026 first-rounders with various protections, or any of the years in between as long as the picks are non-consecutive years. They don't really need more young guys once they add D-Lo - they need to start being good, and they need an engaged, happy Towns on the court. Also, they have to believe that adding D-Lo to Towns and Wiggins throughout all of their primes means that these won't be lottery picks conveying to the Warriors.

I think the Wolves' 2020, 2022, and 2024 picks all top-1 protected should get it done. Or only two first rounders but also including a pick swap in 2021 or '23.

Orlando gets Russell Westbrook, the star point guard to run the offense... a big name at what has been a position of need for a long time.

So I feel like I gotta put this somewhere to quell my overinflated ego.

So one of the most popular questions for those lamenting the 2019 Warriors and their 'what-ifs'. ""What if KD (and/or Klay) don't get hurt?"" I'm going to use some basic basic percentages and a lot of assumptions to purport just some general ballpark estimates to overturn some of r/nba's basic assumptions about the games.

----

#**Who wins if KD doesn't injure his Achilles?**

Putting it into 100% certain yes or no terms is a bit reductive. No team has a 100% chance of winning no matter what.

Some stats. Home teams in Game 7s of playoffs are historically 107-29. That's a 78.67% win percentage.

There have been 19 Game 7s in the finals. Home team has one 15 of them for a basically identical 78.94% win percentage (last road team victory being of course, Cleveland in 2016 against Golden State).

Now, I don't think anyone would argue that Golden State had the overall better team if KD/Klay don't get hurt. But you can't just assume they score 10 more points when he plays. When Raptors were up 2-1, FiveThirtyEight gave them a 71% chance of winning. Unfortunately they don't have the 3-1 stats but we'll make do. Let's take it from the injury onwards.

----

Right before KD is injured when he's bringing it up the court, Golden State is up 39-34. ESPN's win probability gives the Warriors a 57.4% chance of winning at this point. Now, let's give the Warriors the benefit of the doubt and say they outclassed Toronto to the point where they had the game under lock and key for an 80% win percentage. I think that's too high but let's just go with it.

Now, game 6. As under our assumption before, Golden State outclasses Toronto so even starting on equal footing to start, let's say Golden State has 80% win rate since they're at home.

Now, I mentioned the 78% win percentage for home teams in Game 7. Obviously Golden State's win percentage skews that in their favour, but how much? Screw it, let's go crazy and say they have a 65% chance of winning the game instead of a 22% chance.

So their chance of winning the series is

0.8 * 0.8 * 0.65 = 0.416

They have a 41.6% win percent under these assumptions. Screw it let's go even more nuts. 90% for games 5 and 6 and 70% for game 7.

0.9 * 0.9 * 0.7 = 0.567

That's far from 100%.

---

I don't think anyone questions the idea that Golden State when healthy is a more talented team than Toronto. The problem I have with the assumptions that people make when they say Golden State would 100% win if KD wasn't injured is that they just add 10 points to Golden State's final game scores for game 5 and 6. We can't say the games go as they do if the injury doesn't happen. Golden State was down 3-1 when KD gets hurt. Even assuming he's healthy, assuming Golden State has a massive advantage in each of the 3 games, just the hole they have to crawl out of makes it an incredibly difficult task.

And don't get me wrong. If there's any team that COULD do it, it's the Warriors. But people assume that if KD is healthy, it's just an autowin button for games 5 and 6. I'd say it makes them heavy favourites for sure. But 80%? That's just disrespectful to the level of talent on the Raptors squad. I can definitely imagine around 70% but c'mon. The Raptors crushed the healthy Warriors without Kawhi at Oracle in the regular season. Yeah, it was the regular season and the Warriors were coasting but this isn't the Knicks you're playing, it's the best playoff defense since the 04 Pistons. And I'm not even insisting the Warriors aren't favoured. If you think so, I disagree but I respect the Warriors superteam enough to understand why you'd think so. But saying it's a 100% guaranteed series win is just downright silly.

For what it's worth, I would put the Warriors winning percentage at approximately 70% in games 5 and 6, and 50% in game 7 (~40% if no Klay, not because I don't think KD/Steph are good, but because I think whoever replaces Klay is just so much worse). Remember that 50% is a damn good deal higher than the historical 21.33% winrate for actual game 7s. For me, that puts the Warriors win likelihood at 24.5% or 19.6% with no Klay.

So remember. EVEN ASSUMING the Warriors had a 100% chance of winning game 5 and a 100% chance of winning game 6 if KD doesn't get hurt... Winning a game 7 on the road is FUCKING HARD. If you're like Zach Lowe, and you have a gut feeling in your heart of hearts that if Klay doesn't get hurt in game 6 that they probably win the series in 7, I'm 100% fine with that. That is a reasonable opinion to have. I just am so tired of the people thinking it's a guaranteed easy win, or posts saying

&gt;""No disrespect to the Raptors, but if KD was fully healthy alongside Curry, they reverse sweep pretty easily""

or

&gt;""lol if KD wasn't injured no one would be talking about Raptors or Kawhi right now.""

#Milwaukee and the 3 point shot

Offense might be a little easier to explain. 

Milwaukee's play is governed by a simple modern basketball principle that's at the center of analytics: efficiency. 

The league's infatuation to spread the floor and acceptance to shoot deeper 3's came from the understanding of a [shot's worth relative to its position on the floor](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-mapping-shots-in-the-nba-changed-it-forever/), and that a [mediocre 3 point shot is often times a better shot than a less contested shot from the midrange](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhB1vPM8ItA). The idea of surrounding a [premier slashing/interior threat with tons of perimeter shooting](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MIA/2013.html) isn't a [new concept](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/ORL/2009.html) in the [slightest](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/ORL/1994.html), but the league's focus on shooting and efficiency has created an environment where shooters themselves are plentiful, and has granted front offices and coaches permission to run perverse 4-out or 5-out offensive sets with regularity. Hell, even the [consolidation of a team's primary playmaker and primary scorer into a single star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0934lGZ4dw) who can carry a significant offensive load is in itself a kind of efficiency—out of which the new era of scoring point guards like Lillard and Westbrook and superstar wings who blur positional lines like Luka, Harden, and LeBron are all born.

Milwaukee uses the above to surround Giannis, a slashing playmaker, with shooters at all times and leverage the threat of inside scoring and outside scoring against one another (duh). Thanks to Giannis' dominance at finishing around the rim and the high pace Milwaukee plays at, the Bucks shoot the most open 3's per game by a pretty solid margin. [Milwaukee shoots about 39 threes per game (4th) and connects on almost 14 (4th) of them, good for a shooting percentage of .357 (18th) and a 3 point rate of .427 (3rd)](https://on.nba.com/2z34SdD). Of these, [22.6 threes are considered wide open (1st) and Milwaukee converts on 8.2 of them (1st) for a shooting percentage of .364 (23rd) and a shooting rate of .247 (1st).](https://on.nba.com/30nb3Ix)

Having 1 in 4 shots attempted being classified as a wide open 3 is a surefire way to ensure a historically good offense, but it's important to recognize that not all 3s are created equally. Looking at [every single 3 Milwaukee has attempted to this point](https://on.nba.com/2NuoTng) and slicing them up along different parameters shows this pretty quickly. Looking instead [what each individual shoots while wide open and where they shoot them from](https://on.nba.com/2FQpDPa) shows a much more accurate representation of which players opposing defenders let shoot. Giannis leading the team in wide open 3's attempted makes total sense when you consider his desire to add a consistent 3 pointer to his game, and again when it makes sense that opposing defenders would much rather him settle for a jump shot than a drive. 

Next on that list is the linchpin for much of Milwaukee's offensive concerns, Brook Lopez. On pretty much any nationally televised game, Lopez was praised as the model big who managed to adapt to the changing NBA climate and become one of the rare and highly valuable stretch 5s. Both [Lopez](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=brook+lopez+mid+range+shot+chart%2C+2008-09+to+2015-16) and [Gasol](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=marc+gasol+mid+range+shot+chart%2C+2008-09+to+2015-16) were cases of players who throughout their career had serviceable mid range jumpshots, but never had the impetus or permission to shoot them until given new management. For Lopez, that change came under current Nets coach Kenny Atkinson, who was an assistant under Budenholzer's Hawks in Atlanta for 3 years. 

Lopez's arrival in Milwaukee as a free agent in 2018 was a superstar signing for the Bucks and a match made in heaven for Bud and Giannis because having a stretch 5 on the court along with Giannis either puts the opposing center under the gun trying to neuter potential drives while keeping track of Brook, or creating an instant mismatch in putting a smaller defender on Lopez as [Quin Snyder in the 2018-19 season](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5if5ntyiE00), recognizing that Gobert was too important not to have roaming the paint at all times. Because a center's defense is so much more valuable in [contesting a shot at the rim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06YrqzwFBkA) or [dissuading a drive](https://twitter.com/Sneaky__Ben/status/1217307666554544129?s=19), minimizing the impact of someone like a Gobert or Gasol becomes incredibly useful. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/eoz87g/oc_how_rudy_gobert_affects_opponents_shots/) by /u/notimeforarcs over on /r/nba illustrates just how much the very presence an elite defender can wreck the shot chart of a team centered around efficiency by shutting off the paint, so stretch 5s are absolutely mandatory for Milwaukee to execute it's offense. It's a big reason why even Robin Lopez has started to try his luck from downtown to keep this delicate spacing alive. [Stretch 5s](http://bkref.com/pi/shareit/DJwwR) are a valuable commodity around the league because of how rare they are and well they slot into a variety of modern offenses, and ones that bolster their offensive spacing with defensive play as well as Brook does are near ideal. 

However, it is important to understand that with concepts of defensive attention and gravity that they are inherently given rather than exuded, in that a player like Steph Curry will only warp a defense with his shooting inasmuch as a defense will allow. Simply put, a shooter commands as much defensive attention as defenders give them based on well a defender thinks they shoot, rather than how well they shoot. With the proliferation of game film there's often not too much of a difference between the two, but Lopez having an awful year from deep puts him in a particularly unique spot. 

With at least ~3.5 wide open 3PA/G, the only shooters in the league given that much space consistently are [Vucci Mane, Siakam, JJJ, Giannis, Towns, and Eric Gordon](https://on.nba.com/30Cqz3r), and of this group, Lopez shoots by far the worst. His current slump is most notable against teams that utilize the wall strategy and reared it's head throughout the course of the playoffs [last year](https://on.nba.com/2Rmnf85), but especially against [Toronto](https://on.nba.com/2uXsyDB). Getting his numbers back into last year's range of [~37%](https://on.nba.com/2QZ1gFc) or even the ~33% of the years preceding is vital for potential playoff matchups, so teams get punished for overloading the paint.

Aside from that, Milwaukee is having a pretty mediocre year on 3 point accuracy with sharpshooter Brogdon being shipped off for the less accurate Wes, who's 3 point shooting is a lot more [hot-and-cold](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/matthwe02/shooting/2020) as compared to the more reliable open shooting of [Malcolm](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/brogdma01/shooting/2019). Catching Milwaukee in the playoffs with 2 of it's 5 starters cold from 3 could lead to trouble, but up to this point the Bucks have more than made things work on the back of improved shooting from Bledsoe, Khris, Giannis and league leader George Hill. 3 point shooting is hard to predict due to it's high variance, but it's shown that the single best way to beat Milwaukee is to [outshoot them](https://on.nba.com/2TwuVHM).

Another quirk that watching a ton of Bucks games has gotten me to pick up on is the passing out of drives for players like Giannis on Bledsoe once they get the defense to collapse. The single thing that annoys me to no other is that Milwaukee has the tendency to throw ""fuzzy"" passes into the vicinity of an open shooter instead of directly into a shooter's pocket. Passing-wise, [LeBron is the absolute gold standard of this](https://twitter.com/FlyByKnite/status/1196284666799521792?s=19), consistently finding himself among the very best of the league at [assisted points per game from 3s](http://www.nbaminer.com/player-assist-details/) for the better part of 2 decades on the back of individual strength and generational passing acumen. Giannis broke into the top 10 under Budenholzer's offense for the first time last year, and looks to continue being near the top as long as he and Milwaukee continue to shoot. 

The biggest difference between Giannis and Bledsoe and LeBron comes from the accuracy on some of these passes, and the fact that too many times Milwaukee passes into the feet of a wide open shooter, whereas someone like Chris Paul even lines up the [seams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpHZnwfdWZ0) for his shooters on the pass to make them as comfortable as possible and make the transition between catching and shooting as quick as possible. Comparing the passes on these [two targets to Lopez](https://on.nba.com/371YOUe) beyond the arc—a pass into Lopez's chest from Middleton on the first and a pocket pass where Bledsoe anticipates Lopez to be a few steps deeper or to the left makes all the difference in how quickly Lopez can release the ball and how much the contest matters. Lopez is a rhythm shooter so getting him comfortable early with open looks and on target passes are essential to get himself going. Part of Milwaukee's woeful shooting on the back of Giannis' inability to score on Toronto's wall defense came from his inability to pass accurately and consistently out of it. Exploring the total of Milwaukee's [shooting from deep](https://on.nba.com/2RtkPVc) and their [passing turnovers](https://on.nba.com/2R2qe6A) that series shows time and time again where passes aren't put into the shooter's comfort zone, as with Giannis overthrowing the pass to Middleton at ~9:34 left in the 2nd in Game 1, among others. Holding them to the standard of someone like LeBron may not be easy or even fair, but on drive and kicks, he is the one to emulate.

#Milwaukee versus the 3 point shot

On the subject of outshooting the Bucks, that is actually a fairly common occurrence for Milwaukee. At this point, Milwaukee is 1 of 12 teams both with fewer 3PM and on a lower 3P% at this point into the year [(Milwaukee, New York, Golden State, Charlotte, Portland, Cleveland, Memphis, Washington, Orlando, Phoenix, Atlanta, Oklahoma City)](https://www.basketball-reference.com/pi/shareit/Ppu6Q), and of these, [7 of the 8 are the worst defensive teams in the league](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/fourfactors?season=2019&amp;seasontype=regseason&amp;start=10/1/2019&amp;end=01/16/2020) with Memphis being below average, OKC being about average, and Chicago, Orlando and Milwaukee being in the upper echelon.

Milwaukee, like many other modern defenses, operates on principles of concession. Because high pace and an abundance of willing 3 point shooters make it nearly impossible to deny a good shot on every possession, Milwaukee instead tries to shut off more critical areas to concede shots which they are less likely to be consistently punished by. The Lopez brothers provide stalwart interior defense that cuts off easy access to the rim, and the Bucks personnel and scheme try to allow them to [lurk in the paint as much as possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QqKdKz37u0) by getting Giannis to play free safety and using sizable guards and wings to corral players into the paint. If a player manages to get into the paint on a drive, kicks back out to the perimeter are made difficult with a bevy of long-armed defenders like Hill and Bledsoe (6'9 and 6'8), and ball hawks like Donte Divincenzo (3.1 STL%, [7th w/ &gt;200 min.](http://bkref.com/tiny/JHLEQ)). Even when Milwaukee goes small with Giannis as their big, their [athleticism and defensive awareness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x49hNx2JQSM) can often deny drives and recover on breakdowns and closeouts with their great speed.

Milwaukee's refusal to allow shots at the rim leads to a variety of 3 point attempts, but again, using only raw 3PA lack context. With doomsday Exodia offenses comprised of 5 elite shooters still on the horizon, Milwaukee still has the luxury of shifting 3 point attempts over to shooters who'd they would live with shooting from the arc, even if they were open. Last year's Bucks employed the strategy steering opponent 3 point attempts away from corners and towards less competent shooters, as illustrated beautifully by u/bbqchickenbball's series of posts [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ayuaub/oc_the_bucks_have_the_most_unique_3pt_defensive/), and the follow-up [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ebk9wg/oc_not_all_threes_are_created_equal_separating/). 

The more crafty shooters who can create their own shots do put thorns in Milwaukee's sides, or rather unorthodox lineups or actions which are directed to really test Milwaukee's bigs. The most obvious open 3s Milwaukee allows comes from high screening actions for guards like Patty Mills or Kemba Walker who love turning the corner around a screen to see a wide open 3 point look at the top of the arc. Kemba's faced the Bucks defense a few times and beat us last year in [Charlotte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvrCcJiYQJs) and again in [Boston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Aem5nYQ-ZQ) by prodding Milwaukee's bigs and asking them just how far they want to drop back to ensure paint coverage. Most times defending Bucks guards will use their speed and strength to recover around high screen actions and push them into points per possession deficient areas like a closed paint or an awkward midrange runner, but [truly elite shooters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlE1uT2vtgo) with fast releases by utilizing that slight window a screen provides while the defender contests from behind.

Revisiting the topic of stretch 5s and their importance, centers that can spread the floor and stop players like Lopez from sitting in the lane are key for tearing Milwaukee's defense at the seams. Of their 6 losses, 5 came against teams that made it a point to shoot with their bigs in Dallas (Powell/Kleber/Porzingis), Miami (Leonard/Olynyk), Boston (Theis), San Antonio (Aldridge), and Philly (Embiid). Last year's Toronto team picked up offensive momentum when Gasol found his range from deep after starting cold, and his arrival to Toronto elevated their offense by bringing them spacing and passing that they didn't have before. Miami's Olynyk and Leonard pose threats to the Bucks schemes in other screening actions that other teams don't have the personnel to run. 

Going through the list of [attempts](https://on.nba.com/3ajqXrK) and [makes](https://on.nba.com/2Rs1pjJ) from beyond the arc in the Heat/Bucks matchup early in the season you can find plenty of beautiful looks like the [double screening action](https://on.nba.com/2RsKAFa) in the first that got Leonard an open 3, or this [Adebayo corner look](https://on.nba.com/38kkDi9) which with some better vision and a crafty pass might've gotten Leonard another look from deep, but my favorite is definitely this [Leonard 3 pointer](https://on.nba.com/2Rs1pjJ) because it opens with a Leonard/Adebayo screening action along the wing to initiate it. There's not a lot of teams in the league with 2 legitimate bigs willing to shoot 3s with one of them having the passing skill that Adebayo has, so these situations are perfect to test the limits of the Bucks help defense by putting them in unfamiliar scenarios. The Eastern Conference elite pretty much all have 5's who can spread the floor in Turner, Theis, Gasol/Ibaka, Embiid/Horford, and Olynyk/Leonard so outside of the first round, there's not gonna be a ton of time where Lopez will be able to drop back with impunity.

Milwaukee has completed an impressive first half of the season without dominance from outside, but it will be interesting to gauge any shifts in 3 point shooting or defense going forwards. As the trade deadline approaches and potential 3 point threats make themselves known on the trading and buyout markets, it'd be interesting to see if they decide to flip any of the picks gotten from moving Brogdon for a deal similar to Mirotic last year, or if a sudden 3 point change causes Wes or Donte's positions to switch in the starting lineup. Lopez in particular would be the one to watch for Bucks fans in hopes that he finds his touch from deep to go along with his confidence.

I’ve always been on Team Kyrie. I was happy when he left Cleveland because I could see how being looked at as LeBron’s sidekick can be overwhelming. I thought he was going to lead Boston to success and that he was getting too much blame last season.

In a season where Oladipo hasn't played yet and some key players missed some periods of time such as Myles Turner and Malcolm Brogdon, Sabonis stood out as the team leader at just 23 years old.

After many questions related to him after his first season in Oklahoma, where he was forced to be a player he just wasn't, he was ""lucky"" to end up in Indiana through the Paul George trade, where the style of play was more appropriate for him. The number of threes dropped immediately and remained low during other seasons, with Sabonis showing that he is one of the few young old school players. [This chart](https://i.imgur.com/xmiHbU9.png) shows how the number of shots changed depending on the distance from the basket. You can see that as the number of centers and power forwards in Indiana has fallen, so has the number of shots in the Restricted Area risen.

Sabonis' [shot chart](https://i.imgur.com/17TfjtO.png) is also very versatile, he does not refrain from mid-range shots, that is, from the elbow, where he scores the most points per game of all players this season. So this is an area that gets very dark red and where he is very very effective.

Having said that, the [third graph](https://i.imgur.com/w4sqMJO.png) brings us something similar, showing how Sabonis scored points depending on the TYPE of ACTION. We can see him jumping significantly from Pick and Roll this year, and even leading the entire league in pick and roll man points(so the one that rolls out of the pick). Brogdon has certainly contributed to that with his assists over the course of the season. It should also be noted that he now has less points from Spot Up shots than he did in Oklahoma, where although he played little he was used very poorly and was practically used as a Stretch 4 player which he is showing that he isn't. Constant growth in the number of points from Post Ups is interesting.

All in all, Domantas Sabonis is The Man in Indiana, which they proved with a new $77 million contract for 4 years, which is a good deal considering the market.

Although he’s played significantly less minutes than other elite defenders, he has either more steals or more blocks than everyone I just named - and everyone I will name - besides Covington, Isaac and Oubre. 

I don’t want to get nit-picky, so I’ll just name some wing defenders who are better than Buhl. 


In no order -

DEFINITELY BETTER: Kawhi, Giannis, Covington, KD (when healthy obviously), Ben Simmons, (Playoff) Bron

PROBABLY BETTER: Jrue, Draymond, Jimmy, Jon Issac

TOSS UP: PatBev, Smart, Danny Green, Oubre, Dejounte, SGA, Klay (when healthy)

Let me know if I missed anyone, I’m sure I forgot a few guys. 

Thybulle is a rookie. Refs don’t give him “elite defender” calls like they do for some of these other guys who are proven. He can’t reach or hack and expect to get away with it. Straight up, 24/7. 

I might be underestimating Klay, Oubre and Dejounte but let me know what you guys think. 

Not to be that guy, but I got killed on Reddit a few months ago when I was trying to tell people that Buhl is already an elite defender. He might already be a top 10 defender if we’re not including bigs. 

He’s 5th in the NBA in Steal/TO ratio. He has a 103.1 def rating. 0.8 steals and 0.9 blocks per game on 18 mpg. He has 2.4 deflections per game. He’s only going to get better. He’s only going to get smarter, faster and more instinctual on defense. I know... I’m a Sixers fan, but he reminds me of Kawhi on defense. He doesn’t get these numbers in garbage time, he’s getting them in crunch time and in important minutes.

Portland would probably also have to throw in a 2020 or 2021 second round pick.

1) Gets Love out of a situation he doesn't want to be in.

2) Very likely gets the Blazers in the playoffs.

3) Gets the Cavs a young player (Nurkic) who fits their other players' timelines.

4) Helps Cavs tanking effort.

5) Bazermore can help clear up the Sexland situation at least til the end of the year.

I envision Portland dropping Melo down to the 3 at least until Hood is back then maybe moving him to 6th man. At the end of the game he can go back to 4 and Love can play center. Cavs would push Nance into the starting rotation.

Thought he should have had more play at Utah because as soon as his career started, he made an impact on the game.  He was pretty much the same player no matter how many minutes he played, but his problem was he was on a team with Carlos Boozer who was a legitimate starter as well as Andrei Kirilenko, both very impactful players and both basically immovable from starting and getting big minutes.  At one point, they had Kirilenko move to the SF role, and with that move, along with additional development of Deron Williams and Millsap, got to the 2nd round of the playoffs until they hit the buzzsaw of the 09-10 Lakers.  
  
Millsap has performed excellence at every team he's played, and he's been an anchor for a young Nuggets team who made the 2nd round in the playoffs last year and were a Game 7 win from getting to the WCF.  And, as I watch more and more of this team, mostly with Millsap injured, I think it's time to make the change.  Jeremi Grant has been a reliable teammate with Oklahoma and now with Denver.  He provides great defensive support off man, and can cover a variety of players.  And I love him coming off the bench.  
  
Michael Porter Jr. should start for the Nuggets.  And it's crazy, and I can think of at least a few reasons why Denver shouldn't do this.  First, he's a rookie in experience and they are in a playoff hunt.  2nd, he's basically ignorant of the moves and defensive plays of his opponents and will and should get burned badly and often.  3rd, he's a very nice scoring option off the bench for a Denver team whose bench scoring has been lackluster until he started getting minutes.  And I think all these things are true.  
  
But I watch Porter play, I see the speed to the cup, the size and length, and I don't think he should be held back any more.  Denver needs to find out where they are with this kid, and very soon because there are glimpses from him that for me, he looks elite, like he's just playing with his defenders or making them look like traffic cones.  I think he needs to build game reps with Jokic, so he can increase his value offball as well as open up the offense even more with spacing because Jokic in the paint isn't always as effective as Jokic being unpredictable.  Porter Jr. adds that extra dimension of dunks, and he's been a pretty decent shooter outside(limited minutes of course).  I think he can also work a two man game with Murray, and I think the whole thing opens up the offense for more wide open looks for the others.  
  
I haven't seen much of Porter, but he looks maybe as fast as Durant on the dribble, and can shooter over most anyone they put to guard him.  He could be that stepping stone that Denver needs to challenge the powerhouses in LA this year, or those more established groups like Houston or Utah.  Denver knows exactly what they are going to get with Millsap and even Grant in terms of their play, but Porter Jr. is an unknown, and he looks ready for the big time.

My Pick: Utah Jazz
The Jazz have the best defense in the league by far. The numbers will catch up by the end of the season. Rudy Gobert is going to be the DPOY for the third year straight. The Jazz are #2 right now in the WC standings and they are not getting any attention. They are doing this without Mike Conley. Once he gets back to his normal self watch out. The Jazz match up well with pretty much all teams in the league. The scary thing is, the Jazz are a better team towards the playoffs so they aren’t even close to their potential. Donovan Mitchell is a bonafide all-star candidate this year I’ll be shocked if he doesn’t make it. The Jazz also acquired Jordan Clarkson. Check his numbers since he’s joined the Jazz. Clarkson vs Lou Williams would be legendary in the playoffs.

My Prediction: The Jazz will make it to the Western Conference Finals and face the Lakers or Clippers. The only team capable of knocking them out will be the Clippers. If they face the Lakers, I’m taking them to go to the Finals ultimately beating the Bucks.

For the ""Wish they were on the playoff bubble"" teams like the Suns, Kings, Bulls, Pelicans, the season is effectively over. These teams all have about 5% or less chance of making the playoffs.

Having baseball/football-type wild card games before the playoffs would make the second half of the season mean much more interesting for the aforementioned teams, plus pretty much every other bottom dwelling team (except hopeless teams like Golden State &amp; Atlanta).

Under the wild card system, the match-ups would be:

1. Orlando Magic (7) vs. Chicago Bulls (10)
2. Brooklyn Nets (8) vs. Charlotte Hornets (9)
3. OKC Thunder (7) vs. Portland Trailblazers (10)
4. Memphis Grizzlies (8) vs.  San Antonio Spurs (9)

These match-ups are not super interesting, but the wild card system allows for potentially very interesting games. Things to consider:

* Zion is coming back and this makes the second half of the season much more interesting for him and the Pelicans. Also a Ja vs. Zion wild card game would be amazing.
* KAT and Wiggins are having good years and it would be nice to incentivize them to finish out the season strong and not tank. This is true for many other teams too.

He flipped Ron Artest, Brad Miller, Ron Mercer, and Kevin Ollie to the Pacers for Jalen Rose, Travis Best, and Norm Richardson. The big names (Rose, Artest, Miller) were really the main players of consequence in this trade. Artest and Miller would go on to compile multiple all star caliber seasons while also being some of the theoretically easiest players to build around for the time period with their modern skillsets. Jalen (who was 29 at the time of the trade) played 128 games for the Bulls where he compiled good raw box score offensive numbers at a relatively decent efficiency, but with unremarkable defense at a premium defensive position. He also reportedly caused problems in the locker room and stunted the development of Jamal Crawford (another young Bull of the era that they would fail to retain). So how does Paxson rectify this situation? Make another awful trade less than a year later. On December 1st of 2003 he ships Rose, Donyell Marshall, and Lonny Baxter to the Raptors in return for Antonio Davis, Chris Jefferies, and Jerome Williams. Rose would be a solid offensive piece for a raptors team that was starving for that type of player, and Marshall would provide floor spacing as a quality stretch 4 in Toronto - each of these guys playing there for a year and a half. Williams would finish out the year in Chicago as a non shooting defense/boards only big before leaving in the offseason, Jefferies would barely get off the Chicago bench for that season before never suiting up in an NBA game again, and Davis would play a year and a half of solid minutes as an all boards/defense big without shooting ability. The thing that makes this move even more egregious is the fact that the bigs acquired had overlapping skills with and were minute blockers for 2 of Chicago’s best young assets at the time; Eddie Curry and Tyson Chandler. This move possibly stunted the development of each and led to neither of them reaching their potential in Chicago. If this sequence of moves had never been made, it seems distinctly possible that that Bulls team could have had many more players reach their potential in Chicago, potentially yielding a young core of:

PG: TBD SG: TBD SF: Ron Artest PF: Brad Miller C: Tyson Chandler/Eddie Curry

6: Jamal Crawford

The Bulls probably would have still finished lower in the standings of the first couple years of this group, but this could have led to more asset collection that could be used to draft or trade for a star level offensive player. Give this core an offensive hub at guard to work around and you would basically have everything. Artest as a secondary creator and lockdown defender, Brad Miller as an elite stretch 4 at a time when those were almost impossible to come by, Chandler and Curry as two big bodies in the middle to be used on the elite bigs of the day, and Crawford providing energy and scoring punch/creation off the bench. This would have made for the skeleton of a perennial playoff team and Paxson absolutely ruined it in less than a calendar year. These types of past deadline blunders makes me really nervous for Bulls fans as to how this upcoming deadline will be handled.

- Boston (2)

- Miami (3)

- Philly (6)

- Lakers (1)

- Jazz (2)

- Spurs (9)

Yeah they're 36-6 and that's incredible, but an often overlooked part of great teams is their ability to defeat their lesser opponents on a consistent basis. The Bucks have done that and more.

In the last 2 months, the Bucks' average [point differential against playoff teams (9 game sample size) is +10.0 PPG](https://twitter.com/JGosseSports/status/1217418102532714498). On the season its +7.41 PPG.

They are not only rolling over bad teams, but they're (on average) beating playoff teams handily too. 

The Bucks looked to be finals-bound last season before losing 4 straight to Toronto. With the Bucks being the clear-cut favourite out of the East and the best competition being the Celtics, could we see a finals appearance or even championship from them this season? Or is this regular season success going to mean nothing when teams have whole gameplans to thwart Giannis just like the Raptors last season?

4. Russel Westbrook: Always gives 100%. I also think he gets unnecessary hate because if he was just “average” like people imply, anyone would be able to average a triple double for a season. 
5. Kyrie Irving: I just really like his game. I wish he could have been a better leader in Boston , but if that’s not the type of person he is then everyone needs to get over that. I hope he gets back to balling and can be in the MVP conversation one day.

I disagree with this: if a challenge gains a team an average of X points, why does it matter if you gain those X points in the 2nd quarter or in the 4th quarter?

If you see a good challenge opportunity in the 2nd quarter and pass on it, you pass up on the x points and you may not even get another opportunity for the rest of the game.

And on the subject of what is the best situation to use it, to me, it seems like you get the most out of using it to try to reverse a shooting foul, because of the following potential rewards:
- preventing your opponent from a high percentage scoring opportunity
- if you're not in the bonus, you get 1 foul further away from it
- you get rid of 1 personal foul from the player who commits it

I haven't watched many games where challenges have occurred, but from my perspective, coaches should be looking for questionable shooting fouls to use their challenges on (regardless of the quarter). And of course, it's more advantageous to challenge 3-point fouls and fouls committed by better players.

I'm curious if other people here have thought about the best way for coaches to use their challenges and what your thoughts are.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,75604,public,self,Optimal Usage of the Coach's Challenge,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/eor9y4/optimal_usage_of_the_coachs_challenge/,,,,,,,,,,,[]

**An API client to access statistics and data from** [**Basketball Reference**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) **via scraping written in Python.**

I've found that I and several others on this subreddit enjoy visualizing and creating statistical models from NBA statistics and data. Unfortunately, data about the NBA is not easily accessible. I've found the [stats.nba.com](https://stats.nba.com) endpoint to be rather confusing and often blocks repetitive requests.

&amp;#x200B;

Basketball Reference, on the other hand, does not block requests and I've had no issues scraping data from the website for hours on end. Hence, I've always defaulted to obtaining data through this resource. Rather than defaulting to writing a new script every time, I decided to make a Python package that makes all of the content easily accessible.

&amp;#x200B;

The package is easily installable via pip and is available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/basketball-reference-scraper/).

    pip install basketball-reference-scraper==v1.0.1

All the methods are documented [here](https://github.com/vishaalagartha/basketball_reference_scraper/blob/master/API.md) along with [examples](https://github.com/vishaalagartha/basketball_reference_scraper/blob/master/examples.py).

Please feel free to check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/vishaalagartha/basketball_reference_scraper) as well.

I think Brogdon is a noticeable snub on the eastern conference. I'm pretty sure ""The Carushow"" and Tacko don't belong being the only back ups on the list. I was pretty happy to see Adebayo getting votes I think he's been awesome for the Heat so far.

I still think Melo to the Bulls in 2010 gives us a title or two. Derrick Rose, Carmelo Anthony, Joakim Noah, maybe even still having space for Carlos Boozer, that team gets past Miami once.
