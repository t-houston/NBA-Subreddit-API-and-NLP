Hopefully you guys think these are realistic.

[Trade 1 - Westbrook to Miami](https://tradenba.com/trades/ByLo5qAgB)

**[OKC sends]:** Russell Westbrook 

**[MIA sends]:** Goran Dragic, Justice Winslow, Bam Adebayo, Tyler Herro and  an unprotected 2025 first round pick

Miami becomes a contender in the east while giving up a solid PG in Dragic, 3 young prospects and an unprotected pick down the road. The unprotected first makes up for the 2021 and 2023 picks becoming less valuable. Also yes, this trade would have to wait a month or two for the Heat to be able to trade Herro. 

[Trade 2 - Westbrook to Detroit](https://tradenba.com/trades/HkGyneWbH)

**[OKC sends]:** Russell Westbrook to DET // 2020 2nd round pick via CHI to DAL

**[DET sends}:** Reggie Jackson, Thon Maker, Luke Kennard, Svi Mykhailiuk and an unprotected 2023 first round pick to OKC // Langston Galloway and a 2021 2nd round pick via LAL to DAL 

**[DAL sends]:** Cash considerations to OKC and DET

Detroit becomes a contender in the east with Griffin, Westbrook and Drummond. They send OKC some prospects and an unprotected 1st down the road. Dallas is here to make the trade work financially and is compensated from both sides with 2nd round picks.

[Trade 3 - Westbrook to Orlando](https://tradenba.com/trades/B1T42l-WH)

**[OKC sends]:** Russell Westbrook 

**[ORL sends]** Evan Fournier, Fultz, Mo Bamba, two 2020 2nd round picks and an unprotected 2022 1st round pick

Orlando hopes to become a contender in the east with this trade while OKC gets prospects and picks. [Here is another iteration of this trade that adds Isaac going to OKC and Patterson going to Orlando](https://tradenba.com/trades/SyqingW-B)

[Trade 4 - Westbrook to Milwaukee](https://tradenba.com/trades/Hy2a6xWZB)

**[OKC sends]:** Russell Westbrook to MIL

**[MIL sends]:** Eric Bledsoe, DJ Wilson and Sterling Brown to DAL // Ersan Ilyasova, Pat Connaughton, Dante DiVincenzo and a 2024 unprotected 1st round pick to OKC

**[DAL sends]:** An unprotected 2020 2nd pick via GSW/LAL to OKC

I really don't see MIL doing this as it destroys their depth, but if they wanna pair Giannis up with another superstar not named Khris Middleton, they do it. DAL gets involved to make the trade work financially while also getting a legit PG. OKC gets prospects and picks.

[Trade 5 - Westbrook to Toronto](https://tradenba.com/trades/S1JYIklZH)

**[OKC sends]:** Russell Westbrook 

**[TOR sends]:** Kyle Lowry, OG anunoby and an unprotected 2022 1st round pick

Don't see this happening at all, but maybe Masai thinks flipping Lowry for Westbrook is worth the risk. I don't know if OKC would value this return though. No way would Toronto trade Siakam so that is why he is not in this trade. 

[Trade 6 - Westbrook to Houston](https://tradenba.com/trades/S12PAgbWS)

**[OKC sends}:** Russell Westbrook

**[HOU sends]:** Chris Paul, Isaiah Hartenstein, 2021 unprotected 1st round pick, 2023 unprotected 1st round pick and 2025 top 3 protected 1st round pick. Turns into 2026 unprotected 1st round pick if not conveyed in 2025.

Houston flips CP3 for a younger more explosive PG to pair with Harden. Doubt either team does this trade.

**[OKC sends]:** Russell Westbrook

**[MIN sends]:** Jeff Teague, Gorgie Dieng, Josh Okogie, Jarret Culver and an unprotected 2022 1st round pick

OKC gets two young prospects, a draft pick and a solid PG in Teague that is on an expiring contract that they can flip elsewhere. Dieng expires the year after. MIN gets a superstar PG to pair w Towns and Wiggins.

[This](https://tradenba.com/trades/H1w9yZbZr) is an alternative trade that swaps Dieng with Wiggins and the wolves add 5 (five!!!!!) more draft picks as consolation for taking on Wiggins albatross contract. Two unprotected 1st in 2021 and 2023, and 4 unprotected 2nd round picks as well.

There appears to be little to no market for him at this point in time.

Howard is by all accounts a specimen of an earlier NBA, with his positional inflexibility and lack of range. His locker room issues that drove him out of Charlotte are also an obvious issue, as well as him coming off back and hamstring injuries.

Nonetheless, he's only 33 (which honestly surprises me since it's been a full decade since he led the Magic to the Finals), and coming off a 20.4 PER in 81 games in his last full season. He looked okay in limited minutes in his nine games with the Wizards last year. Obviously, Howard isn't going to [https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/wizards/dwight-howard-wants-play-his-40s-and-retire-wizards](play into his 40s), but a veteran's minimum somewhere is still his worst case scenario here.

So, what's next for him? A reunion with the Lakers seem to be an obvious possibility; the roster space is there, and last summer, Howard publicly stated his desire to play with LeBron. Whether the Lakers would want to bother risking a second Howard-initiated locker room implosion, especially with LeBron's window of stardom possibly nearing its end, is an open question.

Dallas might also be within the  realm of possibility, as the rotation need is there.

Perhaps the best fit for him could be Sacramento. Howard could certainly help shore up a need for a team that finished 24th in rebounds last season and just lost its leading rebounder (Willie Cauley-Stein). I could understand extra caution with the locker room situation given that the Kings are one of the younger teams in the league, but this just may be the risk Sacramento needs to take to vault into the upper echelons of the West in a year that, at least at the moment, seems wide open.",False,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,57771,public,self,What's next for Dwight Howard?,0,1562693058,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/canzdo/whats_next_for_dwight_howard/,,,,,,,,,,,,

But they way with the Heat roster is constructed and the lack of assets moving forward I actually think they should make a move. Trading for Butler and the Heats negligence of trading multiple future round picks has cost them their future and put them in a situation where they can't rebuild. Plus they handed out so many big contracts to mediocre players. No one really talks about how bad Pat Riley managed the Heat after Lebron left.

Looking at their roster they do have contracts that can match salary wise and contracts that are short (1 or 2 years). However, the Thunder will want to get a younger player for the future so the heat will probably have to trade Justice Winslow (who is on a great contract). I think Winslow alone might make the trade worthwhile for the Thunder. The Heat can also throw in someone like James Johnson and use a trade expirer (according to ESPN trade machine they have this?). The Thunder are essentially salary dumping Westbrook and giving themselves cap flexibility and getting a decent building piece in Winslow. Heat get Westbrook and him and Butler are two competitive dogs.

The heat will need floor stretchers next to Westbrook and Butler and they kinda have some of that with Dragic, Olynk, Leonard, and Herro. That's why I was reluctant to throw Dragic in the trade because they'll need shooters.

Even during Magic's tenure with the Lakers, Kobe Bryant said in an interview:

""You know great basketball players don't make good GMs.""

In light of what Laker fans consider as an amazing turnaround for the Lakers since Magic stepped down, I wish to know other perspectives about why this is so as well as ask actual examples from y'all.

I'm not saying Magic didn't do any good in his leadership, but here are some of my examples:

Magic admitted to being responsible for letting Brook Lopez walk. Magic also was the one who insisted having more playmakers on the team (as opposed to shooters around LeBron), which led to him completing ""The Meme Team"". Despite having a vision of his own, he still ended up accepting it as a mistake so he tried to correct this in the middle of the season, trading in Zubac (who is now worth $7m/yr.) for Mike Muscala. He got fined an all-time high for tampering for a player the Lakers didn't get anyway, and in the end he had to step down in the most Magic-esque way.

This is not a thread to critique Magic further, but more to learn about the experiences of other fanbases with star players who didn't fare in their front office (or with the coaching clipboard) as well as in the basketball court. And why.

but after the Delon Wright signing or to name it correct sign&amp;trade it becomes pretty clear what path they are going and its quite brilliant to be honest

&amp;nbsp;

it seems like someone from the Mavericks front office read the post on r/nbadiscussion about how the Nets created about 10m cap space out of thin air

Mavs did basically they same but added an extra twist

remember the Harrison Barnes trade in february? they created a 23m trade exception with that trade but as some cap experts here know - if you use cap room you also void your remaining trade exceptions at the same time

so what is the situation right now? Mavs so far signed Curry using up around 8m of their 31m cap space and signed Boban Marjanovic with their room exception and also agreed to re-sign Porzingis/Kleber/Finney-Smith using their bird/early-bird rights

if they outright would have signed Delon Wright into cap space now they would be left with 14m in cap space (not to mention Grizzlies could and potentially would have matched that offer sheet since he is an RFA) BUT if they didnt sign any other free agents in the next days their cap space would have been away once Porzinigs etc offically re-signed - so what did they do?

they sign&amp;traded Delon Wright into their Barnes (23m) trade exception - what did this change?

by using their trade exception Mavericks no longer acted as an cap room team but an over the cap team 

they signed Boban using their BAE, Curry using their MLE - so now they can re-sign Porzingis/Kleber/Finney-Smith AND still have 12m of the Barnes trade exceptions left which they can use throughout the whole season and which could become very valuable since the Mavs are the only team besides the Hawks (13m cap space) that can absorb bigger contracts without problem AND since there are so many teams looking to contend this year some will fail and be sellers and not buyers at the trade deadline and then the Mavs can get some picks or other valuable assets (or some buyers trade a contract into the Mavs trade exception in exchange for picks/rookie deals and then use their newly created trade exception to trade for a win now piece)

As of now this is how I see the Eastern Conference breaking down. I grouped the teams into tiers to add context. Let me know what you guys think, and why I'm an idiot homer for putting my Celtics so high. 


**Tier 1: Championship Contenders**

1. **Milwaukee Bucks-** The #1 seed last year has the reigning MVP who is just entering his prime. The fact that they have a potentially even better Giannis next year makes them elite. The loss of Brogdon hurts, but the Bucks have enough quality players and floor spacers to maintain their top spot. 

2. **Philadelphia 76ers-** The best starting five in the Eastern Conference. They will be suffocating on defense. Harris, Horford, and Richardson all shoot the ball well enough to give Simmons and Embiid space to operate. Embiid' s health is always a concern, and I don't love their bench, but I think they are still a championship contender. 

**Tier 2: Playoff Locks**

3. **Boston Celtics-** Feel free to call me a homer, but I truly believe the Celtics are the third best team in the East. 

The Celtics certainly had more talent last year, but for a variety of reasons the pieces did not fit together, and they were unable maximize the talent they had. I am expecting not only a more harmonic, fun loving team off the court, but that the players will embrace and thrive in their roles.

Kemba isnt quite as good as Irving, but he is still awesome and a top 20 player. Tatum, Brown, and Hayward will all be better than last year. Tatum and Brown due to natural growth, and Hayward because he will be healthier and more confident. I also believe the absence of Irving will help all three unlock a higher level of play.

 Replacing Horford's defense will be the biggest challenge. There is not a big gap between the Celtics and the next two teams, so I could easily see them falling to 5th.

4. **Brooklyn Nets-** Irving is an All NBA player, and a definite upgrade over Russell. I also like the pieces around Irving. I especially like LeVert, and predict he will breakout as an all star level player. Dinwiddie, Allen, Jordan, and Harris are also all solid starters. The Nets have all star talent at the top and a deep well rounded roster. Even without KD this year the Nets are a surefire playoff team.

5. **Indiana Pacers-** Assuming Oladipo comes back by January, and is close to peak form, the Pacers will be a a formidable team. I love Sabonis and Brogdon. Turner is another talented young player. Lamb and Warren provide nice depth and scoring. A well rounded and deep team, the Pacers will be a tough out come playoff time. 

**Tier 3: The Raptors**

6. **Toronto Raptors-** The reigning NBA champs lost the best player in the league. I still think they have enough talent as of now to be a lock for the playoffs. The reason I have them a tier below is because I expect them to trade Ibaka, Gasol, and even possibly Lowry as part of a rebuilding effort. If they simply stood pat, I would have them in the tier above, but still probably ranked #6. 

**Tier 4: Playoff Contenders**

7. **Orlando Magic-** One of the surprise playoff teams from last year have been able to come back with their roster intact. Vucevic puts up major production, and is a legit all star. Gordon is a versatile defender and improving 3pt shooter. Issac and Bamba provide the Magic with some upside. A step forward from either or both could bump the Magic up a tier. They still need a point guard, and lack quality guards in general. I expect the Magic to build slightly on last year and make the playoffs for the second year in a row. 

8.** Miami Heat-** The Heat have a winning culture, an elite head coach and a top 20 player in Butler. That alone should nab them a playoff berth in a relatively weak conference. Adebayo and Winslow are two young players who should continue to grow. I see them as solid NBA starters. The rest of the roster is nothing to get excited about, but has several solid role players that will give the Heat quality minutes. 


9. **Chicago Bulls-** This might be expecting too big a leap, as the Bulls only had 22 wins last season. I love Markkanen and Carter Jr. in the front court. They have all star upside and compliment eachother perfectly. 

The Bulls also upgraded the point guard position substantially, drafting Coby White #7 overall and signing solid veteran Satoransky.

Having Porter Jr. for a full season and the addition of Thad Young really helps round out the roster. I have not even mentioned their leading scorer in LaVine yet. 

The combination of the Bulls young stars improving along with the addition of quality veterans could vault the Bulls to the playoffs. I really like the talent on the Bulls, the only question is if they will be able to put it all together this season. 

10. **Detroit Pistons-** Blake Griffin is a great player. Drummond is fantastic on the boards and is a quality starter. Rose should help them a bit a point guard this year. 

They don't have any wing players. They don't have great depth either. I just can't get excited about this roster. If Griffin gets hurt and misses an extended period of time, this team is in big trouble. 

11. **Atlanta Hawks-** I love what the Hawks are doing. They have a bright future and a great young core to build around. I think it is a stretch to expect them to be a playoff team this year though. No team above them are relying on rookies and second year players as heavily as the Hawks are. While I believe in the talent of these players, you can't expect a team lead by mainly 20 year olds to win many games. 

**Tier 5: No playoff shot, Tankapalooza**

12. **New York Knicks-** Randle put up big stats last year, but I don't think he is even close to an all star. He is bad on defense, a black hole on offense, and can't really stretch the floor. I like Barrett alot, but he is a rookie, and I don't expect him to be a savior his first year. The Knicks dont have a top 50 player next year.

In general the Knicks have pretty good depth across the board, but a bunch of low end starters, and high end backups don't win you alot of games. They would need incredible development from their young players to even sniff the playoffs. I do think the Knicks will be much more competitive than last year, as they have a bunch of legit NBA players and some nice young talent. Unfortunately even a 10 win improvement would give the Knicks only 27 wins. 

13. **Charlotte Hornets-** This is another team with mainly low end starters and high end backups. They have a semi interesting young core of Bridges, Monk and Washington. The Hornets lack the high end talent and scoring to be competitive this year.

14. **Cleveland Cavaliers-** Love is still a good player. Sexton was much better down the stretch and has a bright future. Darius Garland is an intriguing prospect as well. Cedi and Nance are nice semi young rotation pieces.

I just don't think this roster is constructed to compete this year. There is a good chance they trade Love and go full tank mode early in the season. The future isn't completely bleak, but I don't expect much from the Cavs next season.

15. **Washington Wizards-** Its tough to put the Wizards in last place because I think Beal is really good. The rest of the roster in just complete garbage though. I don't even know who the second best player is. Thomas Bryant? Probably, I don't know. This is just a terrible team outside of Beal.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,57571,public,self,Predicting The Eastern Conference,0,1562638460,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/caf71o/predicting_the_eastern_conference/,,,,,,,,,,,,

I do admit they shit the bed in '16 against GSW.. but Westbrook was a huge reason they were up 3-1 in the first place, and that deserves credit. 

The coaching his whole career has been horrendous.  Donovan established a solid defensive squad in '16 but still stuck with the same ISO KD/Westbrook throughout the year and in clutch situations.

Rarely have we seen so many guys at the top of the league move around, even despite not being FAs. Looking over the pas few years as a whole, it's pretty crazy to see how much of the league has shifted. Just a few examples:


- PG is on his 3rd team since 2017 (weirdly enough none of the transactions involved his actual free agency


- Same goes for Kyrie although he moved in FA after being traded


- Kawhi is on his 3rd team in about a year 


- Jimmy Butler is on his 4th team since the 2017 season


- Guys like KD, Kemba, and LeBron all moved in FA


- AD forced his way out of NOLA a full year before his FA


- Chris Paul demanding a trade and going to Houston 


Players are willing to force their way to teams they want whether it's through FA or by demanding trades. PG and Butler are examples of guys who were willing to demand multiple trades before getting to their destination of choice.


This has also caused a lot of aggressiveness from GMs, leading to movements of other notable stars and young players. This is either in pursuit of other stars or naturally breaking apart a team via the active trade market.


- The Clippers grand plan involved moving Blake Griffin for Tobias Harris, then flipping Harris to the Sixers


- Memphis shipped off Conley and Gasol to close the books on the Grit n Grind era


- Demar DeRozan was sent to SA in the Kawhi trade


- D'Lo was traded by the Nets as part of the KD/Kyrie signing


- Plenty of notable young players and draft assets such as SGA as well as the pick that was used to select him, Ingram, Ball, Landry Shamet, the 2019 4th overall that ended up becoming Hunter, the unprotected 2021 Miami pick, a Nets pick that ended up becoming Sexton, and a boatload of unprotected first rounders from the Clips and Lakers. Some of the assets have even changed hands multiple times


- Lots of notable role players such as Harrell, Lou Will, Gallinari, Danny Green, etc.




So given all of this, what are the takeaways? Here's a couple of my thoughts


- Big markets still matter. The LA and NY teams landed 6 of the top 15-20 players in the league and only traded for 2 of them. We have seen 3 guys under contract specify LA as a destination (Kawhi, PG, AD) while under contract, and two guys in the discussion for the NY teams for almost an entire season (KD and Kyrie).


- Stars wants to play together. We've known this for a while but the Kawhi-PG connection is one of the best examples of this.


- GMs are willing to be aggressive for the right return. Despite all the warnings about the Nets trade, two teams were willing to give a historically huge haul of draft picks and young players for the rights to a star. Toronto and the Clips both moved franchise stars for a better chance to compete for a title, which segues into the next point.


- Winning&gt;loyalty. This applies for both teams and players. Toronto and the Clips moved drafted, homegrown stars to get their hands on Kawhi. The Grizzlies made moves for long-term success by flipping Gasol and Conley, two iconic franchise players, for future assets to build around their young group. AD bailed on NOLA to join up with LeBron and a potential 3rd star. Paul George moved out of OKC for a better chance to get a ring with the Clippers. Kemba left Charlotte to join a better supporting cast in Boston. Notable exceptions of this are LeBron and KD, but it could be argued that LA's flexibility and ability to trade/sign stars was a big factor for LeBron and KD wanted a different type of winning.


-  Contracts are losing value. How many times have we seen a player on contract demand a trade? They may not always get where they want, but it's almost always in the team's best interest to send the player off. It took two trades but PG ended up where he wanted. It took 2 trades and a S&amp;T but Butler got what he wanted. Kawhi found his way to LA. AD got to LA. It's a gamble on both sides, but for stars it's a nice insurance that you can get out of your current situation if you want. There's also a flip-side to that, Blake Griffin signed a 5 year deal with the Clippers and got traded midway through the first year because he didn't fit their vision. I don't think we'll see a full transition into player or team options all over the place, but it's at least worth noting that 4-5 years with a team is far from a guarantee.


- Legal tampering is reaching a tipping point. There's a lot of controversy in the Kawhi saga about the Clips openly courting him all year, Kawhi talking to other stars, and eventually convincing PG to request a trade to get to LA. LeBron and AD faced similar controversy, as well as KD and Kyrie. It's nearly impossible for the league to restrict players from talking about joining up, but teams, especially small markets, will push back against their stars being courted and convinced to leave.


- The supermax is not really that helpful. This has been mentioned a lot but essentially the best players don't view it as a golden egg and they can easily turn into huge albatrosses.


What are your major thoughts and takewaways from all this? Will it be a major factor in future CBA negotiations about contracts? Is this better for more hardcore fans when players are always on the trading block? Will we start to see trades and team switching more often or is this just a product of several notable FA classes in a row?",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,57514,public,self,Reflections/implications of the unprecedented level of player movement over the last few years,0,1562613028,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/caaltv/reflectionsimplications_of_the_unprecedented/,,,,,,,,,,,,

Home court advantage in the first round will matter more for most teams, but I'm curious if western conference teams will deliberately try to get onto the east home court side of the bracket in order to avoid playing the best western conference teams.  2018 is actually one year where I see that happening so maybe this isn't the best idea.  Of course, the entire playoffs could be formatted this way instead of just the first round:  
  
E1 Milwaukee  
W8 Clippers

I think both players are good players that were signed despite a somewhat unnatural fit because they were better than nothing. I would bet that both of these players are traded before the end of the contracts and quite possibly this year.


Why Golden State would do it:

Russel and Steph will be a very poor defensive backcourt and Klay being forced to guard 3s instead of the opponents best guard will hurt them further. He also isn't an obvious fit on offense next to Steph in the Warriors system. In Harris, they would get a 3/ small ball four to fill the Barnes/Durant role. He provides with another solid shooter and allows Klay to play his more natural 2guard position. He is also a veteran that keeps his head down and doesn't demand too many touches. 
  
Why Philly would do it:

D'Angelo is a budding all-star guard that would give the Sixers another ball-handler and shooter. He also provides speed and quickness that they lack with Tobias on the floor. He also fits the window of Embiid and Simmons a bit better. 

Why Golden State wouldn't do it:

Trading a 22 yr all Star guard for a guy that has been on 5 teams in 6 years seems crazy on paper. Tobias is probably at his ceiling right now and 32 million dollars is a lot for a guy that will most likely never make an all-star team. He also isn't the most natural fit at SF and has been fairly disappointing in his limited playoff career. 

Why Philly wouldn't do it:

Maybe they really like the supersized lineup. Tobias has actually shot better from 3 than D'Angelo the last 2 seasons. The defense will almost assuredly be worse post-trade. Russel is ball dominant and inefficient. He was also more or less just straight up bad in his one playoff series. Even though they have a young pair of stars, they are in win-now mode and D'Angelo might not be there yet.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,57425,public,self,Potential Golden State-Philly mid-season trade,0,1562577286,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ca4ymm/potential_golden_statephilly_midseason_trade/,,,,,,,,,,,,

Potential Trade Scenario (Best Case):


Chicago Bulls Receive: Russell Westbrook | OKC Thunder Receive: OPJ, Kris Dunn, Cristiano Felicio OR Zach Lavine, Kris Dunn, Cristiano Felicio


Obviously this is the best case scenario. We finally get rid of Dunn and let Coby White/Satoransky split backup minutes, not to mention Felicio's horrible contract is gone. I could see us potentially throwing in a first round pick with the trade to make it a little more enticing as well. This opens up about $10M in cap space according to my calculations using Spotrac, and this is without dipping into luxury at all for 2020 FA. Let's look at potential lineups for the future, I'm going to assume we stick with Zach Lavine since I'm more high on him than OPJ.


Potential Lineup 2019-2020:


PG: Russell Westbrook, Coby White/Tomas Satoransky

SG: Zach Lavine, Denzel Valentine/Ryan Arcidiacano

SF: Chandler Hutchinson, Antonio Blakeney/Thaddeus Young

PF: Lauri Markannen, Thaddeus Young

C: WCJ, Luke Kornet, Daniel Gafford


There's a clear hole here at the SF position since Hutch hasn't shown that much promise, and Thad is a true PF, but in my opinion that's something that can be covered when you account for the development of Lavine, Lauri, and WCJ. Denzel also has length so he could split minutes at the 3. Not to mention potential free agents in 2020 like Harrell, Crowder, Harkless, or Gallinari that we can sign with the cap space we get back from trading Felicio.


You let the young core develop for the 2019-2020 season, get another vet in the lineup and make a serious run in 2020-2021. Westbrook/Lavine/Crowder/Lauri/WCJ starting lineup, not bad in my opinion.

I’d specifically like to hear Bulls/OKC/Russ fans’ opinions on this, but any opinions/feedback would be appreciated. 

Again, this is all based on the speculation of Westbrook coming to Chicago, and I just wanted to give you all an optimistic vision of what this could look like, since there has been little discussion of how the roster would look holistically with Westbrook coming here.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,57417,public,self,Chicago Bulls Potential Trade for Westbrook,0,1562572400,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ca4fuq/chicago_bulls_potential_trade_for_westbrook/,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first is shortages - if more people want to buy something at the capped price than there are things to sell, then people are going to have to go home empty-handed. This was in full swing during Kawhi's free agency, where at least three teams were keeping cap space open to sign him. There was only one free agent of his caliber available, so the teams could not credibly threaten to sign someone else because there's nobody else to sign. The negotiation position for Kawhi was incredibly lopsided in Kawhi's favor because of the contract max, which allowed him to demand the Paul George trade.

Another major effect of price caps is search costs. The short summary of this is that if you aren't allowed to pay with money, you pay with something else. Usually this is time - back when Nixon instituted price controls on gasoline, the predictable result was massive lines and waiting. For the Lakers, this was putting up with the slow pace of negotiations and letting Kawhi use them as leverage in the hope that they actually got the signing. The Clippers, on the other hand, paid a premium through making the trade he demanded. There were other details of this that you could see throughout the process, where teams would tout the non-monetary differentiators that they could conceive of in an attempt to be more attractive without raising salary.

A more basic point here is that every NBA player with multiple max-contract offers is underpaid. If there wasn't a rule against it, they'd be able to get a team to happily offer them more money. This is a big source of leverage for free agents in this situation, since they can shop around this windfall to multiple teams and see what they're willing to do to get it.

tl;dr - if Kawhi was allowed to sign for significantly more money, he would have done that instead of making the Clippers trade for Paul George. But he can't make any more money through his playing contract, so he has to settle for non-financial compensation in the form of team composition.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,57391,public,self,The max contract doesn't get nearly enough credit for facilitating Kawhi's off-season moves,0,1562560976,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ca32kw/the_max_contract_doesnt_get_nearly_enough_credit/,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s still super early, but right now it looks like we’re going to have 12 teams in the west competing for 8 playoff spots, and at least 6 teams conceivably competing for a title.

The Clippers, Lakers, Trailblazers, Rockets, and even that Jazz and Nuggets are all aiming for a finals berth this year at least. The Spurs, Mavs, Kings, and Warriors (who you could throw into “finals contenders” if you’re feeling frisky) are all aiming to be at least competitive and make the playoffs. 

That’s not even counting the Thunder (but who knows what they’re gonna do now) and the Pelicans (who are honestly a playoff team in the east). You can only count out the Suns, Grizzlies, and Timberwolves for sure right now.

Meanwhile, the east has the Bucks and Sixers as title contenders; the Celtics, Pacers, and maybe the Nets as somewhat competitive playoff teams; and a few of teams that are at best also-Ran’s if you’re feeling generous (Magic, Raptors, Heat, Pistons, maybe the Hawks).

The point is, we’re going to have a lot of good teams in the west miss the playoffs (as the best teams will have to win bloodbaths against top-level teams to make even the third round) while a lot of mediocre teams in the east have a slap fight for the right to get swept by a better team. I think this means we’re going to start having the “should the playoffs be the top 16 teams league wide instead of by conference” conversation again, and I for one think it’s pretty clear that the league should just restructure itself. Mediocre teams shouldn’t be rewarded with either the prestige or financial gains you get for being a playoff team, and it would make for more competitive series and a better product all-around. 

The most common excuse to not changing the playoffs structure I’ve seen is distance, which to me is a bit ridiculous, seeing as we have way better transportation than ever before and teams have road trips multiple times across the country during the regular season regardless.

&amp;#x200B;

1. lakers - the team to beat imo. a healthy lebron who hasn't enjoyed a FULL offseason in how long? add AD + boogie + sign vets who have been there before. i think vogel would do a nice job.
2. clippers - this la/la rivalry is going to be something. a defensive trio of bev + pg + kawhi? i don't think there has been 3 all defensive first team since the bulls glory days. doc is a plus.
3. utah - they've won the offseason imo. very saavy moves by this team.
4. nuggets - young team that exceeded expectations last year. didn't make many moves but healthy porter jr could be nice. malone is one of the better coaches in the league.
5. houston- a lot of drama with this team, but i think they did the smart thing by laying low while the rest of the western teams revamp themselves. cohesion is key. d'antoni deserves the axe if they don't make the finals.
6. warriors - wow .. i really hate doing this. steph is one of the top 5 players in the league. i think these top 5 teams will be very competitive all year. steve kerr should know what to do.
7. blazers - i kind of hate doing this too, but the blazers always seem to overachieve for me. they've went from getting swept to the pelicans to making the western conference finals in one years.  whiteside add is nice, but nurkic out most of the year hurts more. 
8. spurs - spurs just seem to remain solid. a healthy dejounte murray is a boon. wouldn't be surprised to see more of their younger players step up. as long as pop is alive, the spurs are a top 8 team.
9. pelicans - biggest wildcard of the year, but they have added some solid veterans to go with zion. 
10. thunder - as long as westbrook is on the team, they will compete.
11. kings - kings making the playoffs as a 7/8 seed would not surprise me at all.
12. wolves - very frustrating team. sorry wolves fans, but i think KAT will pull a KG in couple years unless they surround him with better talent.
13. dallas - they had a ton of cap space and didn't really do anything with it. KP will be nice, but the west has better teams.

The Lakers have made some quick FA signings specifically in adding players that can space the floor very well. How would you rate these signings individually/their fit within the team. 

*Danny Green: He is an exceptional shooter as well as a defender. He had a small stretch in the playoffs where he wasn't hitting them (Bucks mainly most likely due to their length) but his defense was great and I think he will be an amazing fit next to LeBron. 

*Cousins: I think this is a great pickup for a 1 year deal. Very doubtful he will ever return to his pre-injury performance but we have seen how ""good"" he was during the playoffs with his vision. He lacked any jump to his game and barely got any playtime before jumping into the finals. Having an offseason to get his strength, shot, and athleticism back is going to be great. He is great facilitator to pair with LeBron and AD. 

*KCP: A great shooter but can be inconsistent at times. He can play decent defense when zoned in but struggles with bigger guards. Regardless for the contract he is a great addition. He was one of their most consistent FT shooters and is good fit for the Lakers. 

*Quinn Cook: Another great shooter but is pretty awful at defense. He lacks the strength or the length to bother guards. He can bring the ball up but isn't the best play maker. If hit some great shots during the playoffs mainly because he wan't given priority by the other teams defense and made them pay. Playing alongside with LeBron/AD should get him some great looks as well and can hopefully knock them down. I don't see him starting as their PG but with the exception of LeBron they don't have anyone else.

*McGee: Nothing too exciting but not decent signing. He was pretty productive last season before he got sick. An athletic 5 who can run the PnR well and clean up on the glass. He was good at blocking tons of shots last year. A great backup 5 and can give the team some quality minutes off the bench.  

*Troy Daniels: I think we are starting to see trend. The Lakers are moving away from play makers who need the ball/paint and looking towards stretching the floor which makes sense as AD/Bron both paint dominant. He is an another quality shooter but his defense is average at best. Good off the bench. 

* Conclusion: The Lakers are honestly in a pretty situation. They need another play-maker to run the floor when LeBron is resting/taking games off, they need another PF for AD/Bron who can start games and be productive when LeBron/AD are taking games/resting.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,57211,public,self,DeMarcus Cousins signs with the LAL to a one year deal.

&amp;#x200B;

The two big free agents remaining are DeMarcus Cousins and Marcus Morris, and although important and will change minor details in this ranking in a few days, aren't big enough that they will shape the overall outcome of the league.

I rank these teams using an formula

**This formula correctly predicted Toronto would win the NBA Finals last season back in October even though I looked insane when I said so at the time.** ([https://imgur.com/gallery/nV8nJQ0](https://imgur.com/gallery/nV8nJQ0))

&amp;#x200B;

**It also predicted 3/4 conference finals teams** (including Milwaukee when keep in mind Boston was an overwhelming favorite to make it to that point last year). The only team I missed is the Lakers, and with a healthy on the full season LeBron, they make it too.

**It correctly predicted 6/8 Semi Finals Teams, 11/16 playoff teams** (including Clippers in and Pelicans out despite the overwhelming reaction to Pelicans missing the playoffs at the time was negative).

Was not perfect however (had Portland as a top 5 worst team in the league, Cleveland as an 8 seed). I made some changes so it could be more accurate.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is how it works:

\-take the overall ranking of the top 9 players on each team from my overall NBA ranking.

\-include the value of 1st round picks. For example: Ben Simmons was my 17th overall ranked player in 2018 (as the top rookie) and Luka Doncic this past season. I averaged their value out (about 29) and gave those points to Zion.

\-add up the points for each team

\-this is what I added: once a team has it's total amount, subtract:

**150 points for players ranked 1-5 overall**

**100 points for players ranked 6-10 overall (and Anthony Davis although he was not ranked in this range, considering circumstances I put him here)**

**80 points for players ranked 11-15 overall**

**40 points for players ranked 16-20 overall**

**20 points for players ranked 21-25 overall**

For example: The Warriors have a 1400 total score. But Stephen Curry is a top 5 player, and Draymond top 20. So I subtract 190 points from that score which gives them a final of 1210.

The lower the score a team has, the higher they will be ranked. The higher a score, the lower.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, now let's get to the team rankings. I will be putting these teams in tiers.

&amp;#x200B;

    Tier 1: These Teams Are a Flaming Pile of Shit and There's No Other Way of Putting It

&amp;#x200B;

***30. Washington Wizards***

Pre-Draft Score: 1308

Post-FA Score: 2173 (-865)

&amp;#x200B;

**9 Deep:** Bradley Beal, Ish Smith, Rui Hachimura, Thomas Bryant, CJ Miles, Troy Brown Jr, Admiral Schofield, Jonathon Simmons, Isaiah Thomas

&amp;#x200B;

This is the worst team I have ever graded. Even with Bradley Beal. There are 4 players in the 9 man rotation who I have as fringe NBA players, Rui Hachimura is being put in an unstable situation when he needs the exact opposite, this is just a mess and there's no other way around it.

Last year at this time the Hawks were my worst rated team but there was at least some hope there with the young players that could improve (and that did come to fruition). There's little hope here other than watching Bradley Beal do his thing.

I've heard a mention that DeMarcus Cousins maybe would come here. Even if he did they would still be in the flaming pile of shit category and all that would do is put them above Charlotte.

**Prediction: 14-68, 15th in East**

&amp;#x200B;

***29. Charlotte Hornets***

Pre-Draft Score: 1520

Post-Draft Score: 1865 (-345)

&amp;#x200B;

**9 Deep:** Cody Zeller, Terry Rozier, Nicolas Batum, Marvin Williams, Miles Bridges, PJ Washington, Michael Kidd Gilchrist, Malik Monk, Willy Hernangomez

&amp;#x200B;

The highest rated player on this team is Cody Zeller, and in my 3 years of ranking every player he's the worst best player on a team since 2016.

&amp;#x200B;

The 7 deep isn't abhorrent but combine the mediocrity with the lack of star power and this is a team not moving in the right direction. I do think Terry Rozier won't be as bad as the fan reaction right now but it's less about that and more about the clear lack of passion and focus with the overall franchise.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prediction: 21-59, 14th in East**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

    Tier 2: There is Serious Hope, Have Patience it Won't Be Next Year

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***28. Cleveland Cavaliers***

Pre-Draft Score: 1578

Post-Draft Score: 1551 (+27)

&amp;#x200B;

**9 Deep:** Kevin Love, Larry Nance Jr, Darius Garland, Collin Sexton, Jordan Clarkson, Tristan Thompson, Cedi Osman, Matthew Dellavedova, Ante Zizic

&amp;#x200B;

100% they made the right decision with Garland. Picking between him and Sexton I'd pick the former. They went BPA instead of safe and I think it will pay off, just not next season. There will be a lot of times on the struggle bus in 2019-2020 but Garland is a baller and they will not regret swinging for the fences.

**Prediction: 24-58, 13th in East**

&amp;#x200B;

***27. Memphis Grizzlies***

Pre-Draft Score: 1306

Post-FA Score: 1449 (-143)

&amp;#x200B;

**9 Deep:** Ja Morant, Jonas Valanciunas, Jae Crowder, Jaren Jackson Jr, Kyle Anderson, Delon Wright, Josh Jackson, Dillon Brooks, Brandon Clarke

&amp;#x200B;

Of note that the pre-draft score was when Conley was still on the team. The pick is top 6 protected in 2020, I think they could be bad enough to get there. Let's put that aside: Ja/JJJ is a fun combo going forward, the Grizzlies are piling assets on, and as a fan I love the Josh Jackson addition. Talented guy who just needed a change of scenery.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prediction: 24-58, 15th in West**

&amp;#x200B;

***26. Atlanta Hawks***

Pre-Draft Score: 1472

Post-FA Score: 1435 (+37)

&amp;#x200B;

**9 Deep:** John Collins, Trae Young, De'Andre Hunter, Evan Turner, Cam Reddish, Allen Crabbe, Alex Len, Kevin Huerter, DeAndre' Bembry

&amp;#x200B;

The big man depth looks yucky but other than that this team will be fun to watch. If some of the young players develop a little more rapidly than expected I think they have a better chance of moving up more than any other team in this tier. A top 5 seed in the East in 2021 I don't think is out of question.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prediction: 29-53, 12th in East**

&amp;#x200B;

***25. Dallas Mavericks***

Pre-Draft Score: 1235

Post-FA Score: 1425 (-190)

&amp;#x200B;

**9 Deep:** Luka Doncic, Kristaps Porzingis, Dwight Powell, Tim Hardaway Jr, JJ Barea, Maxi Kleber, Dorian Finney-Smith, Jalen Brunson, Seth Curry

&amp;#x200B;

The depth needs improvement (Kelly Olynyk would be a good fit and would move their ranking up a little bit if that trade goes through). Mark Cuban and company knows this. Luka/KP as a combo is exciting as hell, just like the other teams in this range don't think it's happening next year. 2020-2021 is where the serious excitement should begin.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prediction: 30-52, 14th in West**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

    Tier 3: At First Glance Meh, But You Never Know

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***24. Minnesota Timberwolves***

Pre-Draft Score: 1108

Post-FA Score: 1394 (-286)

&amp;#x200B;

**9 Deep:** Karl Anthony Towns, Robert Covington, Andrew Wiggins, Jarrett Culver, Jeff Teague, Tyus Jones, Josh Okogie, Noah Vonleh, Gorgui Dieng

&amp;#x200B;

More of the same. Need to get rid of the Andrew Wiggins contract and both sides mutually agree on that, Noah Vonleh is a low-key good addition and can be a more exciting and younger Taj Gibson. Culver has a potentially high reward.

There's hope, but this team isn't as good as last year's on paper at least.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prediction: 31-51, 13th in West**

&amp;#x200B;

***23. Detroit Pistons***

Pre-Draft Score: 1535

Post-FA Score: 1375 (+160)

&amp;#x200B;

**9 Deep:** Andre Drummond, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Reggie Jackson, Markieff Morris, Luke Kennard, Sekou Doumbouya, Langston Galloway, Tony Snell

&amp;#x200B;

I am in love with the Doumbouya pick and think he will be stellar in the league. In the two 5 year sims I've done on 2K this free agency, the Pistons have won a championship both times and did well in each of those sims.

The roster is full of misfits but they fit together rather nicely in a weird way. My formula was not high on them last year either but they made the playoffs. If Kennard + Doumbouya can develop in the right direction that will make their score better sooner rather than later.

The depth needs improvement but this team is better than they look on paper IMO. Will keep them here for now but subject to change before the season. Either way the future looks a lot better than it did a year ago.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prediction: 33-49, 11th in East**

&amp;#x200B;

***22. Miami Heat***

Pre-Draft Score: 1268

Post-FA Score: 1337 (-69)

&amp;#x200B;

**9 Deep:** Jimmy Butler, Justise Winslow, Goran Dragic, Bam Adebayo, Kelly Olynyk, James Johnson, Dion Waiters, Tyler Herro, Derrick Jones Jr

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just confused by what they are doing overall. I do think with Hassan Whiteside out of the picture, Bam Adebayo could seriously break out next year. But the depth is still mediocre and they need to figure out how to put the pieces all together. That being said, like Detroit, they are at least in the playoff picture.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prediction: 34-48, 10th in East**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

    Tier 4: The Golden State Tier

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***21. Golden State Warriors***

Pre-Draft Score: 1059

Post-FA Score: 1326 (-266)

&amp;#x200B;

**9 Deep:** Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, D'Angelo Russell, Willie Cauley-Stein, Kevon Looney, Alfonzo McKinnie, Damian Jones, Jordan Bell, Jordan Poole

&amp;#x200B;

A healthy Klay Thompson would have them in guaranteed playoff contention and even without him I just wouldn't doubt Stephen Curry. The problem is the depth is atrocious and they have little room for any injures as of right now. Another FA addition or two could help and would move their ranking up.

&amp;#x200B;

But with Klay's injury I could see him coming back in like February or March you never know. I'm not going to sit here and guarantee they won't miss the playoffs but right now the odds of that are likely. Especially with the West extremely deep.

&amp;#x200B;

There's still time but they have to sign a couple of people. JaMychal Green for example I think would be a good fit and would move them up from where they sit currently.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prediction: 37-45 (12th in West)**

&amp;#x200B;

    Tier 5: Sacramento Kings 2018-2019 Tier

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***20. Chicago Bulls***

Pre-Draft Score: 1524

Post-FA Score: 1306 (+218)

&amp;#x200B;

**9 Deep:** Zach LaVine, Lauri Markkanen, Thaddeus Young, Otto Porter Jr, Coby White, Kris Dunn, Tomas Satoransky, Wendell Carter Jr, Chandler Hutchison

&amp;#x200B;

Playoffs? I doubt it. Overperform like the Kings did last year? All indications are these next two teams will.

Young players, increased depth, being slept on, playoffs is an overstatement but they won't be last in the conference either.

As for Chicago, they have a lot to work on. Coby White is being put in a high pressure situation early that I'm not sure he's ready for. The Thaddeus Young signing is an A from me though, and if LaVine/Lauri/WCJ can continue to develop then they could at least compete for an 8 seed.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prediction: 39-43 (9th in East)**

&amp;#x200B;

***19. Phoenix Suns***

Pre-Draft Score: 1326

Post-FA Score: 1295 (+31)

&amp;#x200B;

**9 Deep:** Devin Booker, DeAndre Ayton, Ricky Rubio, Dario Saric, Kelly Oubre Jr, Aron Baynes, Tyler Johnson, Cameron Johnson, Mikal Bridges

&amp;#x200B;

This team will be better than last year.

The individual moves were like WTF, but then you put the pieces of what they were doing together and I have to say they've done a good job of establishing ""Booker and Ayton are our guys, you all cater to them"" and have put the right pieces in place to do so IMO.

The Monty Williams hire is good as well, they are a laughing stock, they won't be by April 2020 I can just about guarantee you.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prediction: 40-42 (11th in West)**

&amp;#x200B;

***18. New York Knicks***

Pre-Draft Score: 1662

Post-Draft Score: 1251 (+411)

&amp;#x200B;

**9 Deep:** Julius Randle, RJ Barrett, Bobby Portis, Dennis Smith Jr, Taj Gibson, Elfrid Payton, Reggie Bullock, Mitchell Robinson, Allonzo Trier

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of short term, they will be better next year and my early prediction is they will be the 8 seed.

And in terms of how shit their value has been, that's more than good enough.

&amp;#x200B;

This team is deep now. Kevin Knox isn't even included in my 9 deep. If him + Mitchell Robinson + RJ Barrett + DSJ develop and Randle takes the reigns as the primary option, dude watch out. The depth is so even if a player or two gets injured it won't be a big hit.

They will be in playoff contention.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prediction: 41-41 (8th in East, 1st round exit)**

&amp;#x200B;

    Tier 6: Will Be Solid Enough, Probable Playoffs in East, but West is deep

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***17. Boston Celtics***

Pre-Draft Score: 1019

Post-Draft Score: 1244 (-225)

&amp;#x200B;

**9 Deep:** Kemba Walker, Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward, Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, Enes Kanter, Romeo Langford, Daniel Theis, Grant Williams

&amp;#x200B;

This team could go anywhere from first round exit to Finals. My early prediction is despite a 7 seed they win their first round matchup. They have a low short term score but they are playing long ball and I like it. Kemba has the leadership and skill to get them through this trial and there will be bumps on the road but they will be Finals contenders in 2021 and with a stroke of luck could even be next year.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prediction: 43-39, 7th in East, make it to ECF. Potentially surprise Finals team.**

&amp;#x200B;

***16. Orlando Magic***

Pre-Draft Score: 1321

Post-Draft Score: 1200 (+121)

&amp;#x200B;

**9 Deep:** Nikola Vucevic, Aaron Gordon, Al Farouq Aminu, Evan Fournier, Terrence Ross, DJ Augustin, Jonathan Isaac, Mohamed Bamba, Wesley Iwundu

&amp;#x200B;

Making the playoffs was the worst thing that could have happened to this team.

&amp;#x200B;

I made a video a year ago saying the Magic could be the dynasty of the 2020's. IF they tanked one more year. Can you imagine let's say they were able to add a Zion/Ja Morant/RJ Barrett to this young core? Shit even some of the players after.

Now they are going to be the Atlanta Hawks of the 2020's with perpetual first round exits if they play their cards too safe.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prediction: 44-38, 6th in East, L in 1st Round**

&amp;#x200B;

***15. Portland Trail Blazers***

Pre-Draft Score: 906

Post-FA Score: 1197 (-291)

&amp;#x200B;

**9 Deep:** Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Jusuf Nurkic, Hassan Whiteside, Rodney Hood, Kent Bazemore, Zach Collins, Jake Layman, Mario Hezonja

&amp;#x200B;

This team is still solid but the West is more deep, and I'm not sure they did enough to keep up since the draft in the short term.

&amp;#x200B;

Long term absolutely, liked the Little pick and am a big fan of Simons. But it's going to be more of a bloodbath in the West this year and there's a good chance 2019-2020 is a step back.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prediction: 44-38 (10th in West)**

&amp;#x200B;

***14. Philadelphia 76ers***

Pre-Draft Score: 1025

Post-Draft Score: 1146 (-121)

**9 Deep:** Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, Al Horford, Josh Richardson, Mike Scott, James Ennis III, Matisse Thybulle, Raul Neto

&amp;#x200B;

I just think what they've done is weird. Focusing too much on short term and not about how these contracts will look in 3 years when the short term value isn't that great to begin with.

On top of that, I've never in my life seen such a drop in talent from the starting 5 to bench. If anyone in that starting 5 gets injured I send the franchise well wishes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prediction: 47-35, 5th in East, L in Semi Finals**

&amp;#x200B;

***13. Houston Rockets***

Pre-Draft Score: 939

Post-Draft Score: 1125 (-186)

**9 Deep:** James Harden, Chris Paul, Clint Capela, Eric Gordon, PJ Tucker, Austin Rivers, Gerald Green, Nene Hilario, Gary Clark

They need another signing or two for depth purposes. Or to make some sort of move.

On that note, how about Russell Westbrook and Nerlens Noel to the Thunder for Chris Paul, Eric Gordon, and an unprotected 1st round pick?

OKC loves CP3 from his OKC Hornets days, and he'd help start the tank. Team Westbrook up with his old teammate and you have the most exciting backcourt in the league suddenly.

Point is, they need something like that to give them a bump. Too much of the same from last year right now.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prediction: 47-35, 9th in West**

&amp;#x200B;

***12. Indiana Pacers***

Pre-Draft Score: 920

Post-FA Score: 1124 (-204)

**9 Deep:** Victor Oladipo, Malcolm Brogdon, Myles Turner, Domantas Sabonis, Jeremy Lamb, TJ Warren, TJ McConnell, Doug McDermott, Goga Bitadze

&amp;#x200B;

This is an interesting team, and they made good moves this offseason that will show benefits in the short and long term. Jeremy Lamb + TJ Warren + TJ McConnell can help right now, Brogdon is an excellent fit, Goga Bitadze was an excellent pick. I'll even go as far as a prediction they get out of round 1. Steps in the right direction for sure.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prediction: 48-34. 4th in East, L in Semi Finals.**

&amp;#x200B;

***11. Toronto Raptors***

Pre-Draft Score: 415

Post-FA Score: 1060 (-645)

**9 Deep:** Kyle Lowry, Pascal Siakam, Marc Gasol, Serge Ibaka, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby, Norman Powell, Stanley Johnson, Patrick McCaw

&amp;#x200B;

This is still a team that will probably make the playoffs. They now have championship experience and I fully expect Pascal Siakam to break out next season. OG Anunoby could be right behind him.

But they will have to re-tool. I do like the Stanley Johnson fit, good for depth and chemistry. In this scenario they beat Orlando in round 1 but fall in the Semi's.

**Prediction: 49-33, 3rd in East, L in Semi Finals**

&amp;#x200B;

    Tier 7: The Big Bubba Daddy's. Playoffs, but not Contenders

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***10. LA Lakers***

Pre-Draft Score: 1040

Post-FA Score: 1117 (-77)

**9 Deep:** LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Danny Green, Kyle Kuzma, JaVale McGee, Kentavious Caldwell Pope, Quinn Cook, Alex Caruso, Jared Dudley

&amp;#x200B;

Marcus Morris would be an excellent fit. DeMarcus Cousins too. Find a way to sign both and the team is in a lot better position, even just one of them.

Either way if they sign I still don't see them getting to the conference finals. Not enough depth and not enough splash with the pieces surrounding the big two. They went for a home run and got a double.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prediction: 50-32, 8th in West, L in 1st round. If DeMarcus Cousins (this just happened)/Marcus Morris sign, 3/4/5 seed and L in Semi Finals.**

**EDIT: DeMarcus Cousins has signed. This would move them up to 4th.**

&amp;#x200B;

***9. Brooklyn Nets***

Pre-Draft Score: 982

Post-FA Score: 1113 (-131)

**9 Deep:** Kyrie Irving, Spencer Dinwiddie, Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, Joe Harris, Taurean Prince, DeAndre Jordan, Garrett Temple, Wilson Chandler

A healthy KD and this team would have been clear contenders. Potentially even my pick to win it all, the injury is unfortunate.

In the East this is still good enough for a 2nd seed. And a 2nd round matchup vs. Kyrie's former team. That being said if these two teams faced off in the playoffs I'm going Boston, the team has overall more playoff experience and a chemistry edge this Brooklyn team just wouldn't have. But still a very successful year.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prediction: 52-30, 2nd in East, L in Semi Finals**

&amp;#x200B;

***8. Oklahoma City Thunder***

Pre-Draft Score: 1058

Post-Draft Score: 1025 (+33)

**9 Deep:** Russell Westbrook, Danilo Gallinari, Steven Adams, Jerami Grant, Dennis Schroder, Shai Gilgeous Alexander, Nerlens Noel, Andre Roberson, Terrance Ferguson

The trade made them better, A+ grade for OKC.

Gallinari gives this team something they haven't had in forever: spacing. They also get a young PG (no pun intended) for the future in SGA.

I don't know if Westbrook will want to stay but this team got better this offseason. Are they contenders? No. But Sam Presti coincidentally re-deemed himself and I'm not sure if he even did it on purpose. This trade is absolutely the best thing for this team short and long term. But is trading Westbrook much better for long term? We'll see what OKC thinks.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prediction: If Westbrook stays and has faith in this team, 52-30, 7th in West, L in 1st round.**

&amp;#x200B;

***7. Sacramento Kings***

Pre-Draft Score: 1171

Post-FA Score: 1023 (+148)

**9 Deep:** De'Aaron Fox, Buddy Hield, Harrison Barnes, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Marvin Bagley III, Trevor Ariza, Nemanja Bjelica, Dewayne Dedmon, Cory Joseph

&amp;#x200B;

I think the Kings will make the playoffs this year. I still don't like what they did this offseason, but I understand for a franchise that hasn't made the playoffs since the Ice Age.

These moves will absolutely help this team in year one, make no mistake they will be better next year and I think 50+ wins is realistic. I just also think the value on these moves will decline dramatically after 2019-2020, but the Kings' goal is to clearly make the playoffs and that I believe they will reach.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prediction: 52-30, 6th in West, L in 1st Round**

&amp;#x200B;

***6. New Orleans Pelicans***

Pre-Draft Score: 1024

Post-FA Score: 996 (+28)

**9 Deep:** Zion Williamson, Jrue Holiday, JJ Redick, Derrick Favors, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Jaxson Hayes, E'Twaun Moore, Josh Hart

&amp;#x200B;

The Pelicans will splash and make a statement early.

David Griffin gets an A+++++ for what he's done this offseason. Getting the 1st pick helped sure but holy macaroni does this team have a bright future now. Not only that, but he's made moves to set this team up for success now and that will make the transition smoother and more flexible for Zion.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prediction: 53-29, 5th in West, L in 1st round**

&amp;#x200B;

    Tier 8: The Dark Horse Contenders. A very small chance they could win it all, but it's a chance.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***5. Denver Nuggets***

Pre-Draft Score: 893

Post-FA Score: 893

**9 Deep:** Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray, Paul Millsap, Gary Harris, Monte Morris, Mason Plumlee, Will Barton, Malik Beasley, Torrey Craig

The one team that literally stayed the exact same (despite no IT anymore) and is it enough? It's enough for them to be in the 5 teams that have any chance of winning a ring next year.

What pushes them to clear contender status? MPJ and Bol Bol returning to their once top 5 projected pick form. That 110% would. Even one of them doing so. That's a big if but possible.

**Prediction: 54-28, 4th in West, L in Semi Finals**

&amp;#x200B;

***4. San Antonio Spurs***

Pre-Draft Score: 919

Post-FA Score: 873 (+46)

**9 Deep:** LaMarcus Aldridge, DeMar DeRozan, Rudy Gay, Bryn Forbes, DeJounte Murray, Patty Mills, DeMarre Carroll, Marco Belinelli, Derrick White

This team isn't sexy but they are going to get the job done. They literally go 13-14 deep and are probably the most balanced team in the league. The chemistry reminds me a ton of the Clippers last year except this team is more talented.

Do I think they are going to win a championship? No. But they will surprise the hell out of people, but it's the Spurs so maybe not.

**Prediction: 55-27, 3rd in West, L in 2nd Round**

&amp;#x200B;

    Tier 9: 98% chance one of these 3 teams will be winning the NBA Finals

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***3. Milwaukee Bucks***

Pre-Draft Score: 718

Post-FA Score: 882 (-164)

**9 Deep:** Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, Eric Bledsoe, Brook Lopez, Wesley Matthews, Ersan Ilyasova, George Hill, Robin Lopez, Pat Connaughton

I am prepared to make a Milwaukee/Boston ECF prediction. I will say I liked their chances to win it all a lot more with Malcolm Brogdon and I think they are going to find out just how crucial he was to that team's success this year.

But there's no Kawhi in the East now and even regarding the circumstances at minimum I think they make the conference finals and will face Boston. I'm going to hold off during this early part of the offseason at making a prediction further than that. This Boston team I believe will be a chemistry force that will outperform expectations and talent level in the playoffs. With Brogdon I would be making a clear Bucks to Finals prediction right now. I'll mull it over the next month or two.

**Prediction: 58-24, 1st in East, TBD (at least ECF)**

&amp;#x200B;

***2. Utah Jazz***

Pre-Draft Score: 926

Post-FA Score: 801 (+125)

**9 Deep:** Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley, Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Jeff Green, Ed Davis, Royce O'Neale, Emmanuel Mudiay

This team is for real. Not only do they have ridiculous depth, they have a now 3 headed monster in low-key star power and that is a dangerous, dangerous combination. You might laugh at me saying they are guaranteed contenders but the FO has built this team extremely well and are coming out swinging with full force. Do not sleep on this team and it will be a mistake if you do.

**Prediction: 61-21, 2nd in West, TBD (at least WCF)**

&amp;#x200B;

***1 LA Clippers***

Pre-Draft Score: 1171

Post-FA Score: 787 (+286)

**9 Deep:** Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Lou Williams, Montrezl Harrell, Patrick Beverley, Landry Shamet, Ivica Zubac, Rodney McGruder, Maurice Harkless

This is it, the time is now. The Clippers have arrived on the scene. The NBA is changed forever, I've said that 2019-2020 is going to bring balance and clarity to the league for some time now.

Nevermind that: 2020 is going to be a fucking royal rumble. The 2010's was WCW, 2020's the NWO is taking over brother.

I'm still shook, the Clippers are here to take over LA.

The 2010's were a decade of dominance and super teams. There will still be super teams.

The catch: the talent pool is balancing out rapidly to a point where teams with depth are going to be making a name for themselves. See Utah, Denver, San Antonio.

Don't get me wrong, you still need star power. But this upcoming season is going to be a full force slugfest and I'm hyped to see it.

YUP!\n\n\nNow...it\'s different.  Within three weeks, the whole landscape of the NBA has changed.  While the Nets have now become a title favorite for a while, this next year has them +2200.  \n\nIn fact, 6 of the top 8 teams in the title odds are from the west.

Finals MVP has gone to the Clips and brought his friend, PG13, with him.  This Clipper team was praised for their hard nosed, in your face mentality last playoffs.

I understand giving up these picks for a chance to win a title is always something you must do. But this is something that will last 12 years. (12 years because you can't go 2 consecutive years without picks, so every other year they get your pick, and then the final two are pick swaps, so they get the lesser of the 2 picks.)

**If they don't win a title this may be looked at as one of the worst trades ever in the future.** This was a shit ton to give up for one guy, and on top of that they also gave up SGA.

First, they managed to get the Rockets to give them Pat Beverley, Montrezl Harrell, Lou Williams and a first round pick in a sign and trade so that CP3 could get his max contract. They later used that pick to get Danilo Gallinari.

Then, they dealt Blake Griffin to Detroit for Tobias Harris, Boban, Avery Bradley and a first rounder. That first round pick was used in the trade for Shai Gilgeous where they ended up giving Charlotte 2 second rounders to swap spots.

Then, a few months ago, they traded Harris to Philly for a package that included Landry Shamet and two first rounders, one of them being the coveted Miami pick.

Finally, a few days ago, they were able to get Mo Harkless and another first rounder from Miami just for absorbing the Harkless contract.

A few other things worth mentioning.

The Clippers were in constant asset collection mode, always winning small moves here and there and adding quality depth. That depth was on display last year when they managed to make the playoffs in the West even after trading Harris and despite having zero stars. They built the kind of quality depth that might appeal to, oh I don’t know, a superstar free agent who might be looking for a new team. I don’t know how many times we’ve seen teams in recent years (namely the Lakers and Knicks) constantly gave away assets for cap space to sign free agents, only to strike out on said free agents. Why would anyone think that an empty roster is attractive to superstar free agents that can have their pick of what team to go to? 

Also, In the last two years, they’ve been a .500 team. The FO made the decision not to tank, but to be competitive and try to rebuild on the fly. So not only did they turn this thing around in two years, they did it without any high lottery picks. 

Which brings us to yesterday.

In the span of two years, the Clippers did such a good job collecting assets and “winning trades” that they had enough in the barrel to not only pay what they did to get PG, but have a solid supporting cast left over. Harrell, Lou and Beverley were the heart and soul of last years playoff team. Landry Shamet is a high level sharpshooter and just an awesome fit next to the guys they have. They are going to be able to start three of the best defenders in the league, then bring Harrell and Lou in to play against the opposing bench.  

They have Jerome Robinson and Kabengele, two young first rounders that can either be bench pieces or trade chips. They have depth and they’ll add more cheap veterans in the next few weeks. Guys are wanna come here and ring chase.

I hope, with all the stuff about Kawhi pulling a power move and hijacking PG, that the bigger lesson isn’t lost on people. As was the case in Brooklyn, the winner of these free agency sweepstakes were teams with good geography and a strong front office. Everyone had NY and LAL as the favorites and they ended up losing out to better run franchises in the same city.

And before I go, a word on the Clipper from office. I love Jerry West to death and he’s arguably the best NBA GM of all time, but I question the wisdom of crediting him for what the Clippers have done here. One of the many brilliant things Ballmer did was bring in a lot of talented guys to run his team, because he has god money and he understands how to run a business. Lawrence Frank and Michael Winger have great reputations around the league, and they’ve built a deep staff. Even Jerry West himself has said that he’s just a consultant and that those guys deserve the credit for the Clippers turnaround.

#1. Loose lips lose (relation)ships

Chris Haynes, who is a very well respected reporter, tweeted [this](https://twitter.com/chrisbhaynes/status/1147411452489154560?s=21) after the Kawhi signing was announced:

&gt; Kawhi Leonard and his camp found it comical throughout the process that he was “reportedly” headed to every team but the Clippers. In the end, his small circle kept everyone guessing. And that’s what occurred: guessing.

Cris Carter also [tweeted](https://twitter.com/criscarter80/status/1147398638638968833?s=21) about the hush hush agreement surrounding Kawhi:

&gt; All the information that leaked from Magic’s conversations with Kawhi team didn’t help the Lakers case.

Not to mention the numerous reports that Kawhi and his camp were stressing to all 3 teams, the Lakers, Clippers, and Raptors, that they should keep things quiet with regards to Kawhi and their meetings with him. The Lakers had leaks, *cough* RDAmbition *cough*, the Raptors had the plane and hotel saga, and the Clippers had... nothing. 

#2. It’s not about who you were, it’s about who you **are**

KD, Kyrie, Kawhi, Paul George, all chose the “secondary” teams in the big markets of New York and Los Angeles. They didn’t care about the history or tradition of those teams, they cared about which teams gave them the best chance to win. And history doesn’t play on the court.

The Nets and Clippers both spent years building, years that the Lakers and Knicks spent talking and recruiting. The Nets and Clippers both built young, deep teams, that would allow recovery time for KD and load management for Kawhi, respectively, and would be great supporting casts capable of winning championships for years to come.

#3. “Go big or go home” is not a motto to live by in the NBA

This is potentially the most controversial lesson, so I’m interested to hear other opinions. But we have now seen the Nets and Clippers take their time to build something special and it has paid off. Meanwhile we’ve seen the Celtics, Sixers, Raptors, and Thunder get spurned by their hot pursuit of big moves. Now you can argue the Raptors got what they wanted, and that is true. It worked out for all parties. But their future is still not as bright as it once was now that they lost Kawhi for nothing.

To me, this shows that it is better to bide your time and just build a solid team rather than go after big names in hopes of building through recruiting. If you can put together a bottom tier playoff team that plays hard and impresses people, other players take note of that, and you can use that image to sell to stars. But if your only selling point is “we traded for you”, that’s not going to stick very well. And even if it does for a moment, in a player driven league, things can change in an instant, like with PG. So building a culture and an image as a team is a whole lot better than building a culture and an image with one player propped up.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,57195,public,self,Lessons from the 2019 NBA Off-Season,0,1562522768,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/c9wm23/lessons_from_the_2019_nba_offseason/,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'fMDS4pcdCvhh0F-c5-V-GQQAe0Jby0hqqQun-sasy6Y', 'resolutions': [{'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/pV6Xk_pAaEfXu-jYS1p16puRpLujPYtGu9tvL_a9mfs.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca4cf7eb7038948a0d789422e571cb90a2b949e3', 'width': 108}, {'height': 216, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/pV6Xk_pAaEfXu-jYS1p16puRpLujPYtGu9tvL_a9mfs.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f10b02ad39b9ff04545bf78634114c6005e3507b', 'width': 216}, {'height': 320, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/pV6Xk_pAaEfXu-jYS1p16puRpLujPYtGu9tvL_a9mfs.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32cc54f2bac184376151035dc3d2b3f5a15b58b3', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 400, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/pV6Xk_pAaEfXu-jYS1p16puRpLujPYtGu9tvL_a9mfs.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=b1c25cea599428f12445f0c7507f13f80c827c21', 'width': 400}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,

I  think Lebron is the best player of this era. His imapct globally and domestically is arguably comaprable to MJ and maybe compareable to Kobe. His talent a lone if you take away his mental problems and negatives is top five alone. I want him to prove more why he is top five and even three. Getting Kawhi for me just keeps proving Lebron always needs help and risks more criticism that he gets carried more than other greats. LAC look really scary so LAL are not favorites for sure. But the team looks really good with Green and Cook signings. It is a top three team in the west fmo if things go well. But Lebron needed this so he can prove he is one of the best. AD is a huge help in general and can even be betetr than Bron in general. Bu Lebron needs to work hard like he did in 2016.

I'll name the 3 biggest reasons here.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Potential

The Orlando Magic finished the season strong after being 20-31 as of January 29, 2019. They finished going 22-9. One of the biggest changes? Defense. They were number 1 in defensive rating over the last 30 games of the season. That's while starting undersized DJ Augustine and with ""poor"" defenders Vuvevic and Fournier playing heavy minutes. The team knows how to commit to defense and finally had a taste of the playoffs after quite some time. Westbrook is a veteran PG with Finals experience to help lead them further.

2. Fit

We all know Westbrook is not much of a shooter, but he is absolutely amazing at rebounding for guard and in terms of shot creation. The Orlando Magic are already a top rebounding team and with Westbrook may become the best in the league. Their main weakness? Shot creation. They have plenty of players who are fantastic finishers or shooters.

&amp;#x200B;

Vuvevic lead the league in points as the pick and roll man last season. Terrance Ross and Evan Fournier are two of the better spot up shooters in the league. They have great length and athleticism with Jonathan Isaac and Aaron Gordon. This team would wreak havoc defensively while meshing offensively in both the halfcourt and in transition.

3. Win-win

The Thunder would currently be fighting for a playoff spot without George. Their owner was already hesitant about paying the luxury tax and there's no way he'd do so for a non playoff team. The Magic on the other hand just came off of their first playoff birth since 2012. They want to carry their momentum forward and this is their best  chance to grab a superstar.

&amp;#x200B;

The trade would include multiple 1st round picks. I didn't add it to the table because there's no way to know how many. Let's assume the Magic include unprotected '20, pick swap '21.

|Orlando Magic|Give|Receive|
|:-|:-|:-|
||DJ Augustine |Russell Westbrook|
||Markelle Fultz||
||Timofey Mozgov||
||Chuma Okeke||

&amp;#x200B;

|OKC Thunder|Give|Receive|
|:-|:-|:-|
||Russell Westbrook|DJ Augustine|
|||Markelle Fultz|
|||Timofey Mozgov|
|||Chuma Okeke|

&amp;#x200B;

Combined salaries going out for the Magic would be about  $37,000,00. About $24,000,000 is expiring and Fultz contract has a team option meaning they could potentially clear 33 million if Fultz doesn't work out.   The Magic become a threat in the East and the Thunder save a ton of money.  We've also never seen Westbrook on a team with a much spacing as the Magic can offer him. Here's an article from his MVP season just as a reminder of the level of play Westbrook can reach. Don't let his recent season fool you. Westbrook is a superstar.

Wall making his case as the best two way guard in the league,  IT as an elite playmaker. Both players gunning for max contracts. Now they're teammates, (one on a max, one on a min contract) and compose one of the most irrelevant and dysfunctional teams in the league.

&amp;#x200B;

The Celtics obviously lost Thomas, but that's ok, they signed two max players in his absence. Neither of who are the franchise centerpiece, that would be Jayson Tatum, who you last remember as an 18 year old at Duke.

&amp;#x200B;

The Raptors are exactly who they were when you left, a team that will probably win 1 series every year, no more, no less. Except for that one year where they traded Derozan, actually won a second series, and a third and a fourth. That's right, you wouldn't know it if you watch them this upcoming season, but they are the reigning champions. Fred VanVleet is a Toronto legend. Kyle Lowry is a future hall-of-famer. You may have noticed (probably not) Pascal Siakam who logged 10 minutes in a 4 game sweep against Cleveland. He's actually one of the best young players in the NBA.

&amp;#x200B;

You knew before you left that the Cavs would be heading to their third consecutive finals, and they'd even squeek out a forth. But they only won one game in two years. Kyrie fled, LeBron fled, JR got banished, Lue fired, and now their franchise is built around Collin Sexton (who?), Darius Garland (who??) and Dylan Windler (??????????).

&amp;#x200B;

When you left, the Rockets had championship aspirations, but with the makeup of their roster and system, it's obvious that they have to play PERFECT, and likely can't win it all. Besides for personnel, absolutely nothing has changed in Houston.

&amp;#x200B;

While San Antonio has been clearly the second best team in the NBA in 2017, it's all downhill from here. Leonard wins the 2019 Finals MVP, just not with San Antonio. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Warriors, shock to no one, won the next two titles after your departure. 8 wins in 9 finals games. Without question a top 3 team of all time. while it looked like that would become a 3peat about 2 months ago, that fell short and now no one really knows if they're a playoff team.

&amp;#x200B;

Who we do know is a playoff team is the team they're about to sweep, the Utah Jazz. They were last led by All-Star Gordon Hayward, but he ditched them, and is now an afterthought around the league anyway. Still, after losing Hayward for nothing, they improved, and have title aspirations led by some kid who you last saw as a projected late first rounder out of Louisville.

&amp;#x200B;

You may have been wondering what CP3 and Blake are up to in LA, well they're not. CP has been traded to Houston, Blake to Detroit. Those trades brought them Lou Williams, Pat Bev, Trez Harrell, Landry Shamet, among some others. those 4 will play next to Kawhi and Paul George to form the league's most feared team. You last saw Jordan Clarkson and Julius Randle leading the Lakers, but that turned into LeBron and Anthony Davis, who were the best team in the city for all of two weeks.

One asking why it existed and the other wondering if it may be related to the concept of the nba max contract. Interestingly, after seeing Kawhi and PG go to the Clippers, I am now just a bit more convinced that the Lakers exceptionalism is oversold. Consider:

&amp;#x200B;

This never happens in other sports. Why is it in the NFL teams never experience this kind of exceptionalism. The cowboys never land a big free agent because they are the cowboys. The answer: the max contract doesn't exist. If you want to pay a player 99 percent of the cap, they can do so. If you want to play that player for 10 years, you can. In the nba, with some minor exceptions, all teams can offer is a 4 year max or a 5th year max for essentially the same per annum amount. And even the 5th year max is muted because if a player enters their 10th season, they become eligible for a bigger max. Bottom line - the money is not hugely different.

&amp;#x200B;

And so, if the money difference is immaterial, other factors become the deciding factor. Its here I think where people mistakenly think that other factor is lakers exceptionalism. In reality, I think the two biggest factors are playing in your preferred hometown and playing with other stars. Phrased in that way, there should be no difference between the Clippers and the Lakers, nor Brooklynn and the Knicks. And ...well thats how it played out. 

&amp;#x200B;

The clippers and nets - two teams who have never attracted big fish free agents, both did. The nets got Kyrie because he is from new york and wanted to play with Durant. Durant joined the nets because of Kyrie. AD joined the lakers because of Lebron and Rich Paul. Durant joined Golden State for Curry and Thompson and Green. 

The Clippers got Kawhi because he wanted to be back in LA. PG originally requested the LA teams because he is from LA. Would they have done so had they been from New York or Florida or Texas? I doubt it. Would Toronto been more able to keep Kawhi if they could have sold him on a pairing with another legit superstar?

&amp;#x200B;

All this hababalooo about titles and fan base is frankly overrated compared to the draw of a preferred city and playing with stars. 

&amp;#x200B;

 And then there's this: If exceptionalism was really a huge factor, why did the Lakers strike out on every big free agent between Kobe's last year till Lebron? They had the same glitzy appeal they do now.

Lebron choosing the Lakers would imply the one piece of evidence that exceptionalism still exists. He chose the lakers because they are the lakers. Or perhaps he joined the lakers because he could control everything behind the scenes just as he had done in Cleveland. One thing I think Lebron learned about his superstardom was that he could leverage it to hold the team over a barrel and that's just what he has done. He wanted to live in LA and he wanted to run the team. 

&amp;#x200B;

For me, the big takeaways would be - if you are a fan or gm of all the non glamour market teams, you should be pushing to eliminate the max contract offer and allow fluid contracts.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,57176,public,self,Lakers Exceptionalism Revisited: One More time,0,1562518649,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/c9vt2k/lakers_exceptionalism_revisited_one_more_time/,,,,,,,,,,,,

If there is interest, I might write up a post at the end of each day recapping the games I watched. For the most part, I will be focusing on specific players of interest instead of the overall game flow. I haven’t gone back and re-watched the replays, so forgive me if I misremember something (but please do correct me in the comments). I have no professional scouting experience so take everything I say with a massive amount of salt. So with that, let’s get started.

#7/5/19 – Day 1

I arrived at the arena around 5:30 and the place was packed for the Pelicans vs Knicks. Apparently tickets for the day were sold out and although the seats weren’t literally all full, it was an impressive showing for a summer exhibition game. Since I got to Vegas relatively late in the day, I was only able to catch the end of Bulls vs Lakers (which I won’t comment on), Pelicans vs Knicks, and some of Spurs vs Magic. 

##Pelicans vs Knicks

* The Pelicans went all out during the layup line, with Christian Wood, Kavell Bigby-Williams, and (of course) Zion trying all manner of 360’s, windmills, and between the legs dunks. 
* In contrast, the Knicks seemed to be all business with the players doing standard layups and jumpshots. 

###Zion Williamson

* The first play after tipoff looked like a designed lob to Zion, which unfortunately didn’t connect. Zion scored his points exclusively off of free throws and dunks this game. His athleticism was as advertised, but overall I thought he was forcing things a bit. He mostly attacked the basket with straight-line drives, and was still able to draw fouls on a number of those drives despite not using much creativity in terms of dribble moves or change of pace. 
* Zion’s jumper looked like it suffered from both being a bit slow to wind up and having a lower than ideal release point. It may get better as he adjusts to playing against NBA length and speed, but it is something to monitor as the games go on. The Knicks quickly went to matching Zion up against Mitchell Robinson, giving him the Giannis treatment of being guarded by a center. I imagine we might see a lot of this in the coming NBA season.
* Zion didn’t particularly stand out at the defensive end. He had one ridiculous block in which he got really showed his leaping ability (which didn’t matter since his teammate fouled the opposing player anyway), but aside from that didn’t seem to make his presence felt at the defensive end. Granted, he only played 9 minutes. 

###RJ Barrett

* RJ had a couple nice drives and finishes, but for the most part was not getting all the way to the rim. He generally didn’t seem to be able to get enough separation off the dribble and took a lot of tough/contested floaters and push shots outside the restricted area. This will be something to monitor because it’ll be tough for him to be an effective scorer if this trend continues and also he can’t knock down his jumper. 
* Speaking of his jumper, he had a really bad shooting game today. His jumpshots were mostly open / lightly contested and he shot 1 for 8 from 3. He certainly showed confidence in continuing to take these jumpers and even though he isn’t known as a great shooter, I imagine he’ll shoot better next game. 

###Other Players

* I liked what I saw from Kevin Knox today. His jumper looked good and he took his shots with confidence. He also had a play where he showed some great handles by getting his defender to jump the wrong direction on a nice crossover. Knox is known for being inconsistent, so we’ll see if he can keep this up. 
* Frank Jackson looked like the best scorer on the court in this game. He had a hot shooting game from 3 (5 for 9), but also created a variety of other kinds of shots. I didn’t know much about him going into this game, but he certainly grabbed my attention today. 
* Alonzo Trier and Mitchell Robinson looked good for the Knicks. Trier from creating and hitting shots and Robinson as a finisher, rebounder, and rim protector. I didn’t focus on either of these guys a ton when watching the game, but thought I’d mention it.
 
###The Earthquake

* There was some slight shaking in the arena, and you could see the jumbotron/speakers swaying a little bit. It didn’t feel particularly strong or look like they were going to collapse, but people immediately started bolting for the exits. I took this opportunity to find better seats in the lower bowl, which ended up in vain when the players left the court entirely. I then went over to Cox Pavilion to watch the Spurs Magic game, which went on for ~30min before it got shot down after the end of the 3rd quarter. 

##Spurs vs Magic

###Lonnie Walker IV

* Walker essentially was the Spurs’ offense this game. He aggressively took a number of Westbrook-type midrange pullups out of the pick and roll, and those shots were falling for him in this game. I noticed the Spurs moving him around to multiple positions (likely due to his size), playing him both on ball as the primary PG and off ball as a secondary guard / wing. 

###Mo Bamba

* Bamba didn’t stand out much to me in this game. The only positive I remember from him was him knocking down a wide open 3 at the top of the key. He didn’t seem particularly impactful rebounding or defending the rim. If anything, he kinda got upstaged by a white center on the Spurs I had never heard of (Drew Eubanks).

###Drew Eubanks

* Apparently this guy was on a 2-way with the Spurs last season. He had a couple nice blocks, including one where he swatted a player’s fading layup with 2 hands. Eubanks also had a nice drive and finish against Bamba off the dribble and didn’t seem particularly bothered by Bamba’s height or strength. I even noticed them doing some hand fighting while running up the court together.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,57106,public,self,[OC] In-Person Summer League Impressions - Day 1,0,1562486000,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/c9r3n2/oc_inperson_summer_league_impressions_day_1/,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lemme know what you think!

My Case:

The teams I believe can make the finals are the Bucks, Celtics, 76ers, Pacers, Nets, Warriors, Nuggets, Lakers, Clippers, and Jazz. That’s ten teams! Last year, we were excited that there were more than two!

In the 2020 NBA Finals, the Los Angeles Clippers will defeat the Milwaukee Bucks in 5 games. Los Angeles might have one of the best defensive teams ever assembled and have plentiful offense. The Bucks are the only contender in the East that is made up of mostly the same stars and didn’t lose huge pieces (Horford, Kyrie, Butler, Bogdanovich, Russell). However I think the defensive prowess of three all-nba defenders against the Bucks will be too much. Jerry West is a genius. Kawhi and PG13 both get to be where they want, LA, and have a legitimate shot at winning a championship.

This has the simultaneous effect of weakening the Lakers and the Raptors. With the Raptors losing both Kawhi and Danny Green and replacing them with no one, along with the further aging of their already old core (Lowry, Gasol, Ibaka), I personally see them having a tough time getting through Giannis next year, barring an incredible leap from Siakam. He's already made numerous leaps forward, so it wouldn't be a great surprise, but the Bucks and the 76ers are quite formidable next year. This is still a quality team, but they'll descend in the playoff pack to hang out with the new-look Celtics and the Nets (without Durant for now), in my opinion.

**Lakers**

Of course, this also brings us back to the Lakers. LeBron and AD aren't getting that third max player they wanted. With all the talk about it potentially being Kemba (who was linked to Boston almost immediately), Kyrie (nope), Paul George all the way back a season ago, and obviously, Kawhi, surely the Lakers are disappointed they struck out here. Now they'll have to spend $32M on free agents who evidently won't be worth as much as Kawhi would have meant to the team. Since the Clippers are now out of cap, the Lakers are pretty much the only team left with money to throw around. Danny Green, Marcus Morris, KCP, Rondo, McGee, and others should be snapped up pretty soon, assuming the Lakers FO is awake and has gotten the news. Pickings are slim now that free agency has gone on for so long, but they took a risk and it didn't work out. Shit happens. That said, they still have LeBron and AD, who can make something happen. Surround LeBron with shooters, let AD do his thing, and there's sufficient reason to expect success for that roster.

**Clippers**

As for the Cliippers, they still have a decent group of players post-trade, since they gave up their future capital to the Thunder. Gallinari was probably mostly to match salaries, and I'm sure the Thunder are excited about SGA, but four unprotected first-rounders is wild. They now have three defensive powerhouses in Patrick Beverley, Kawhi, and PG13, to go with Shamet, 6MOTY Lou, ""6MOTY x2"" Trez, Zubac, and others. That's a rotation that I'm comfortable with at least six players deep in the playoffs, and I might trust Zubac, McGruder, and Harkless to play enough defense to let Kawhi and PG13 do most of the offensive work. They have a couple of roster spots that need filling (11 players for now), so they should also be in play for a few of the free agents available.

------------------

To most of us I'm sure, these acquisitions automatically vault the Clippers into championship contention. The West was already simultaneously wide open and a bloodbath, and this just makes it even harder for the other teams in the West. Teams that moved into win-now mode (e.g. Lakers, Jazz) now have to deal with a second team that features multiple top 10 players (as if the Warriors weren't already enough last year) and has more players than the Lakers. (Only saying that because it's hard to make a full evaluation of the Lakers roster if Jared Dudley is their 4th player.

It seemed to be pretty universally agreed upon that there were 5 clear playoff teams in the West (Warriors, Lakers, Nuggets, Jazz, Trail Blazers, and Rockets) and Clippers makes a 6th, while weakening another possible playoff team in OKC. This will create an interesting race for the 7th and 8th seeds, though those teams will have the unfortunate circumstance of going against a strong contender. Virtually every other team not yet named will be going for those spots.

He can only dunk and play defense. Essentially a Blake Griffin with defense. His passing game is okay but like Lonzo imo it's not going to translate to the NBA game given how quick the offenses are. He can't shoot threes and is uncomfortable shooting twos. He's not going to have that many dunks given the better interior defense in the NBA. And i don't see many fundamentals in his game, it rather looks like he relies on athleticism more than anything.

I didn't watch the summer league game except the highlights and I wasn't surprised by the comments. There is a difference between players like Zion, Wiggins, Bennett, and Simmons, when compared to players like LeBron, Kobe, Kyrie, and Towns. The first group has no fundamentals for outside scoring while the other group with the exception of Towns does. Towns can get away with it because he is a threat on the outside with his ability to shoot the three. Those players are not. I'm not saying LeBron was an outside scorer when he first came in the league, but the fluidity of his skillset, his ability to shoot left or right on a spinmove driving down the lane or any of his other moves that he came with into the league are not in Zion Williamson's game. All I see is a hopstep and a Julius Randle-esque crossover.

I didn't see much from Coby White's first half highlights but I think to come up with a premature premature prediction for this player isn't suitable because he has the potential to develop a better outside game. Ofcourse the Zion prediction is premature but I think it something i am more easy about predicting. He might turn into a second option on a really good team but he is not the player you want to build your team around because at the very best, in my opinion, you will be getting a Demar Derozan - Toronto situation.

#Intro

Normally, the GOAT debate has two main players: LeBron and Jordan. The argument generally discusses skill, eras, marketability and championships. Kareem's skill was on the same level of both Jordan and LeBron, and he won as many championships as Jordan, and has more MVPs than LeBron and Jordan.

According to a [poll of this sub,](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYWbVmPjBT_hVUkKlxWjGjFs1apEf1n_SZqjchBrzIBRNxDA/viewanalytics) 54% of participants said Jordan was the greatest player of all time, 37% said LeBron was, and a measly 2% of voters said Kareem was the GOAT - coming in 4th behind Wilt.

# Stats

Many people today use statistics when comparing players, and Kareem's are at the same level of both LeBron and Jordan's stats.



Name| Career PPG| Career RPG| Career APG| Career PER| Career WS/48| Career TS%| Career DRtg|
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----
LeBron James| 27.2| 7.4| 7.2| 27.6| .235| .586| 103| text
Michael Jordan | 30.1| 6.2| 5.3| 27.9| .250| .569| 103| text
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar| 24.6| 11.2| 3.6| 24.6| .228| .592| 99| text



As seen from the above table, Kareem's stats are definitely on the same level of the others, and he averaged more blocks than them, but less steals than them.

#Competition and Supporting Cast

Another common topic in the GOAT debate is that of the supporting cast and the competition faced. Some, unwisely, remove Russell and Chamberlain entirely from the discussion simply because of the competition they faced. Some of Kareem's best teammates are as follows, with their **average PER over the span they played with Kareem**:

* Magic Johnson, 10 seasons (23.9 PER)
* Oscar Robertson, 4 seasons (17.5 PER)
* Adrian Dantley, 2 seasons (19.1 PER)
* James Worthy, 7 seasons (18.1 PER)
* Bob Dandridge, 6 seasons (16.4 PER)

Some of these players were in their prime (Magic), while others were nearing the end of the career (Big O). 

Similarly, Michael Jordan played with the following:

* Scottie Pippen, 11 seasons (19.7 PER)
* Toni Kukoc, 6 seasons (18.7 PER)
* Dennis Rodman, 3 seasons (13.2 PER)
* Horace Grant, 7 seasons (17.2 PER)
* BJ Armstrong, 6 seasons (14.4 PER)

Lastly, some of LeBron's most prominent teammates have been:

* Dwyane Wade, 4 seasons (25.2 PER)
* Zydrunas Ilgauskas, 8 seasons (18.4 PER)
* Chris Bosh, 4 seasons (19.4 PER)
* Ray Allen, 2 seasons (13.8 PER)
* Kevin Love, 4 seasons (20.1 PER)
* Kyrie Irving, 3 seasons (21.7 PER)

In my opinion, Kareem had the best consistent supporting cast, but his isn't that far better than the teams LeBron and Jordan have been a part of. All players have had a mix of prime legends, retiring stars, and straight up bad people to play with.

# Accolades

In terms of accolades, Kareem leads the way by far. Some of this does have to do with his extended career in the NBA - LeBron could very well match, if not surpass, some of them.

* Championships: Kareem tied with Jordan for 6 (only 2 FMVPs for Kareem, 6 for MJ)
* All-Star appearences: Kareem leads with 19, LeBron follows with 15
* MVPs: Kareem has 6, Jordan follows with 5.
* DPOYs: Jordan is the only one, with 1, but this award *did not exist when Kareem plays.*
* All-NBA 1st teams: Kareem has 10, tied with Jordan (LeBron has 14).
* All-Defensive 1st teams: Kareem has 5, tied with LeBron, though Jordan has 9. Including 2nd team mentions, Kareem has more than both Jordan and LeBron.
* Other: Kareem is a two time scoring champion (J: 10, L:1), one time rebounding leader, four time block leader, and rookie of the year.

#Skill + Domination

I really dislike comparing talent across eras, since I believe the average skill of an NBA player is constantly increasing throughout the years. Nevertheless, I think that Kareem, Jordan, and LeBron are/were equally talented for their eras. Jordan is probably the only one that ""revolutionized"" the game, in the sense that he created new moves and perfected them, ones that are still used today. On the other hand, Kareem perfected the hookshot, an already existing post move, but made it nearly unguardable with his modified version - the skyhook. Out of all three of the players discussed, LeBron probably has the most ""talent"" but the least original moves, and it is understandably so. The longer the NBA goes on there will be fewer ""new"" moves.

Personally, I think few players dominated the NBA like Kareem did. Jordan could be comparable, but it can be argued he did not truly dominate until further roster additions were made - the same for LeBron. Kareem has a 6-4 finals record, though not as good as Jordan's 6-0, is still phenomenal. In his **third year** in the NBA, at age 24, Kareem averaged 34.8ppg and 16.6rpg. At age 24 LeBron was averaging 29.7/7.3/8.6, a truly legendary statline, but Kareem was already an NBA champion at that age, winning the previous year. At the same age, Jordan was coming off of his 37ppg season and putting up 35/5.5/5.9, again, monster numbers. But, Jordan was not an NBA champion at that age and lost, again, to the Pistons.

# Conclusion + TL;DR

Kareem has comparable skills and level of dominance to Jordan and LeBron, as well as similar accolades.

Zion will have to learn how to play against significantly bigger and more athletic competition, which I think will take more than one season to adjust to.

- the Grizzlies, Spurs and Jazz each went 2-1 while the Cavs failed to get a victory, ending 0-3. 

- Utah’s Tony Bradley led all players averaging 20 points across 2 games, edging Lonnie Walker by 0.5 over the same amount of games. Bradley also averaged SLC highs of 15.5 rebounds and 2.5 blocks per game.

- Spurs’ Keldon Johnson and Lonnie Walker led the way in scoring, with both shooting over 50% from the field. Johnson also netted 4 steals across 2 games. 

- The Cavaliers’ Mitrou-Long averaged 15 points, 4 rebounds, 4 assists, and 1 steal across 84 minutes, the most minutes played in the tournament. 

- Memphis was lead by Watanabe and Washburn, who averaged 16 and 15.5 points respectively. Ivan Rabb averaged 7.5 points on 29% shooting and 4.5 rebounds. Keenan Evans has provided scoring at the point guard spot. 

In Cali,

- Miami finished 3-0, 1 game ahead of the Lakers and 2 games ahead of Sacramento. While the Warriors failed to win a game. 

- Miami was led offensively by Nunn, Herro and Maten, the former two combined for 41 points in a win against the Warriors. In a win against the Lakers, Herro hit 5 threes.

- Gabriel led Sacramento to its only win in California with 22 points and 12 rebounds against the Warriors. 

- Zach Norvell led the Lakers in scoring and put up 20 points in their first win. Jordan Howard and Nick Perkins took over vs the Kings to lead LA to a 2 point win. Howard had 17 4Q points that game. 

- For the Warriors, Damian Jones might been their most consistent player. While, Evans and Paschall each had a stand out game in California.

This gets the Heat under the hard cap and sets them up to compete assuming Wall is back at some point before the playoffs. Pat Riley is close to retirement and wants one more chance at the finals.

Let's start with the Warriors situation for comparison since people disliked them as well. I used to love watching the Warriors pre-KD. The Curry/Klay/Dray combination was full of ball movement and a fun style of play. They were the prohibitive favorites in 2016 (and would have been again in 2017), but I was ok with that. They built the whole thing from scratch.

When Durant signed with a 73 win team it just felt... cheap. The struggle seemed to be gone for them, and the whole thing seemed like a foregone conclusion. Was it possible for them to lose? Sure, but it seemed like only injuries or luck could derail them.

This Lakers thing is different to me because through it all they're going to have to build it from scratch. I felt the same way about the Heatles. Did great players get together? Yep, but they had to build it from the ground up. We got to see flaws in the Heatles team, and I'm guessing we're all going to get to see some flaws in this Lakers team if it comes together.

Heck look at it this way. Is LeBron/AD a 73 win team without Kawhi? Not even close.

To illustrate how apathetic the Grizzlies were about acquiring him, the Suns attached two second round picks and De'anthony Melton, who may as well be the headliner of the trade. Jackson was...very bad in his time in Phoenix, and if you didn't watch him play, you can look at any of his advanced statistics to see this. The bust label is closing in quickly, and it's going to be attached to the front of his jersey soon if he can't turn things around in Memphis. 

I don't think many people noticed this trade, either because of Kawhimania or because this is business as usual for the Phoenix Suns. In my opinion, it's a combination of reaching on draft night, impatience, and a lack of direction that's causing promising young talent to wash out of Phoenix, and keeping them from returning to the playoffs. 

Josh Jackson was the last major draft choice from Ryan McDonough, who was fired October 8th of 2018. He has my vote for worst GM in the league over his tenure, beginning in 2013. James Jones has since taken over, and we'll see if he's able to right the ship. Before those two, it was Lance Blanks (2010-2013). These are the tenures we'll be looking at. Here are the players drafted in that time span, omitting late 2nd round picks because I don't think it's reasonable to critique a general manager for missing on what is basically a lottery ticket. 

* Cam Johnson, 11th overall, 2019 (as part of a trade) 
* DeAndre Ayton, 1st overall, 2018
* Mikal Bridges, 10th overall, 2018 (as part of a trade) 
* Josh Jackson, 4th overall, 2017
* Dragan Bender, 4th overall, 2016 
* Marquese Chriss, 8th overall, 2016 (as part of a trade) 
* Devin Booker, 13th overall, 2015
* TJ Warren, 14th overall, 2014
* Tyler Ennis, 18th overall, 2014
* Bogdan Bogdanovic, 27th overall, 2014
* Alex Len, 5th overall, 2013
* Kendall Marshall, 13th overall, 2012
* Markieff Morris, 13th overall, 2011

Let's start with some positives. Devin Booker was a steal at 13th overall, and could be the face of the franchise moving forward. Deandre Ayton just had a great rookie season and while he was overshadowed by Trae Young and Luke Doncic, I don't think there's anything wrong with taking him 1st overall in that draft, especially considering the Suns already had Booker. Markieff Morris was also a good player, but was eventually traded for a pick that became Georgious Papagiannis (more on him later). 

**Drafting the wrong players**: Some players just aren't cut out for the NBA, and no reasonable amount of help provided by a team can get them to stick. There's definitely some of that here. Kendall Marshall, Tyler Ennis, and possible Marquese Chriss fit here. Every organization has bad draft picks and there's not a lot of critique I can provide here. Do your research, scout harder, make more informed decisions. I thought selecting the ""safe"" pick in Deandre Ayton was a good sign for James Jones' decision making going forward, but, we'll get to my doubts about that later. Dragan Bender might be next on this list, he's running out of time to prove himself. 

**Impatience**: The Suns go through head coaches like the New York Yankees of the late 70's. Since Jeff Hornacek's departure at the end of the 2016 season, they've had a new coach every year. It's often mentioned that Devin Booker has had a different coach every season of his pro career. Booker is incredibly talented, and can clearly work through this lack of consistency. Yet it's incredibly unreasonable to ask all of their young players to deal with an environment like that. Many of these players are still teenagers when they get to Phoenix, consistency is very important in helping them reach their full potential. 

The blame for this really goes to Robert Sarver (or whoever is making these decisions, I have to assume it's the owner). A coach isn't going to turn a roster like this around in one season. You're going to be bad, embrace it for a little bit, and build for the future. Or sell the team. You could always do that, as I'm sure Phoenix fans will point out. This leads nicely into my next point. 

The Suns don't keep players young players around long enough to really see if they're going to fit or not. They love to make deals, even though they usually lose the trades they make. If I'm a GM of another team, I'm licking my lips at the thought of trading with the Suns. 

Marquese Chriss was acquired from the Sacramento Kings on draft day 2016 in exchange for Skal Labissiere, Georgios Papagiannis, and Bogdan Bogdanovich, as well as an additional second round pick. This package essentially moved them up from 13th to 8th in that draft to get Chriss. They gave up a considerable amount to get Chriss- Labissiere had a lot of hype early in his college career that tapered off due to injury, and though Bodganovich hadn't yet played in the NBA, he's currently a big contributor on an exciting young Sacramento team. If you invest these kind of assets in a player, it's critical you protect your investment. 

Chriss played 21 minutes per game for the Suns for 2 seasons, and then they packaged him with Brandon Knight for Ryan Anderson and De'anthony Melton. They then played Melton for 50 games and used him as a sweetener to ship off Josh Jackson for...nothing, essentially. They're not going to use Kyle Korver. I expected James Jones to learn from the mistakes of McDonough, but this move screams McDonough. 

Speaking of Josh Jackson, if he turned things around on his next team, he wouldn't be the first. Take Alex Len, for example. The Suns let him walk last offseason, he signed with Atlanta, and suddenly learned to shoot 3s, in addition to posting his highest PPG of his career (albeit on more shots). Jackson was definitely underwhelming in his first two seasons, but he was beginning to show some improvement. His FT% and 3PT% rose significantly in year two while playing the same amount of minutes. Don't get me wrong- he has a lot of work to do if he wants to stick in the NBA. For a tanking team to attach assets just to get rid of him, when he's only making 8 million this season? Moronic.

**Lack of Direction**: Why did Phoenix need to clear up that cap space? To sign veteran point guard Ricky Rubio (while retaining Kelly Oubre, which they should have done). He's a good player, and can contribute to playoff teams. Phoenix is not a playoff team, but they signed the veteran to a 3-year, 51 million dollar contract. 

In addition to Josh Jackson, they also parted with T.J. Warren, in a move they're generally getting mocked for. I will not be the one to stand up for them. Warren was coming off the best season of his career and is on a team-friendly contract for 3 more seasons. It's possible they wanted to stick with Kelly Oubre at SF and that's fine, even though Warren outperformed him in virtually every way last season. They also acquired Dario Saric from the Timberwolves, who they'll likely want at power forward. They could have traded Warren for something other than nothing, which is what they received, and in addition they parted with the 32nd pick of the draft. The Pacers immediately flipped that pick to the Heat for 3 conditional second-round picks. 

Yes, Phoenix did need a consistent point guard. They didn't have to pay this much for one, especially not when they're already paying Tyler Johnson twenty million dollars this season. Additionally, they had just drafted Cam Johnson, a move they're also getting laughed at for. It's obviously too early to tell how Johnson's career will turn out, but he was definitely a reach at his spot in the draft. 

It seems like Phoenix lacks a clear direction. They're bad, but they trade away future assets to sign veteran players. They should be developing their young guys, not shaking up the roster every season, and adding a new coach to boot. A bit of roster and management consistency could go a long way to them improving as a basketball team. My biggest fear for this team is two years down the line, Ricky Rubio is getting traded with one of their current young prospects attached, to sign another Ricky Rubio. I don't have a lot of faith in James Jones moving forward; despite a promising start (ie, not botching the 1st overall pick in a stacked draft), he's looking like the sequel to McDonough. The organization needs to settle on a coach, settle on a general manager, and commit to a multi-year plan to right the ship.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,56644,public,self,"The Phoenix Suns are in a perpetual rebuild.

We saw with Charlotte let the best player in their franchise's history walk because paying him the supermax would have been more detrimental then him walking out the door for nothing. And Charlotte with Kemba isn't the first team that's shown signs of being fucked by the supermax.

Houston with Chris Paul, arguably OKC with Russ, Washington with John Wall, to a slightly lesser extent because it wasn't a *super*max but Mike Conley in Memphis, it all is looking like the supermax makes teams choose between title contention and loyalty to their players. The only supermax that hasn't blown up in someone's face yet is Steph's and that was because he's already delivered Golden State 3 rings. And lord only knows that Portland is on a tight clock with Dame's supermax hovering on the horizon.

I would never propose cutting into these guys's paychecks. They earn that money because they make it to the conversation of best in their position in the best (and one of the most profitable) league(s) in the world. But the supermax currently feels more like a double edged sword then I think was intended. And this double edged sword has cut the deepest in small markets.

My only conclusive thought on this has been that there should be 1 uniform max cap hit on a contract, and then if the player is supermax elligible that gap between max and supermax money should be payable as a bonus that doesn't count against the cap. It's just that currently the NBA's players have trended towards ""squading up,"" and leaving supermax money on the table. Guys like LeBron, KD, Kawhi, etc. Have all left their drafted teams so for the *elite* elite players the supermax doesn't even do it's job at that point. The supermax really only helps players that are not-quite-the-best cash in on the end of their primes at the expense of their team's flexibility and championship contention unless you're literally an MVP. *Fun fact: of the past 10 MVPs, only 3 of them have been in* ***The top 10*** *highest paid players in the NBA. '18 Harden, '17 Westbrook, and '13 LeBron.* To dovetail in with that, LeBron is 1 of 2 players this decade to win the NBA championship the year they won MVP, the other being Steph Curry in '15.

These NBA superstar guys have the people around them to calculate that their best chance at a title is to form a team in Miami, or Los Angeles, or Brooklyn and then once they've done their winning in X, Y, or Z location it doesn't even really matter that they shaved a few million off their NBA paycheck because being the man on a championship team comes with its own endorsement money that'll more than make up a slight paycut at the NBA level.

The league has become a stretch league and it would be amazing to see the Lakers stretch the floor so much with Anthony Davis hitting close to 38% of his catch and shoot 3’s, you have so many options. I believe if you get someone who can shoot the 3 and handle, this becomes in my opinion, the toughest team to guard of all time in the NBA.

I think someone they can look to is Jamal Crawford as a starting 2. I know he’s played the sixth man role for a large chunk of his career but he could be the guy who sacrifices touches. They could bring back KCP as well, which could be a smart play for the Lakers who overpaid him the last two seasons. He could take the minimum or close to it so the Lakers can bring him back.

When most teams add a big piece, they’ll talk about the fit, the play style, schemes, etc. and how it will work.
 
For example, Chris Paul to Houston. The media did nothing but criticize the ball-dominance of them both and talked about the fit non-stop. 

Another example is Jimmy Butler to the Sixers. They ranted about the fit and play styles all day long. 

Kevin Love going to Cleveland is another one. The list goes on and on. 

But I haven’t seen that been analyzed once on the main programs with LeBron and AD. Nobody has thought about the fact that LeBron and big men in the past haven’t meshed exceptionally well. Chris Bosh was basically turned into a 3 point shooter and same with Kevin Love. If they didn’t have a perimeter shot, they’d have been almost useless with LeBron. 

Now, I know AD is a scorer and can develop an improving outside shot, but his MO is dominating the inside with his athleticism on both ends. If he turns into Chris Bosh 2.0 he won’t be producing at the MVP level that they expect. When you combine that with LeBron entering his 17th season in the NBA.... why is it not even reasonable to mention it *might* not be the best team in the world. 

Now, I know the responses are going to explain why the Lakers will be a good fit and how it will work out, and that’s entirely possible. But that’s the point, I want to see the media actually analyze how they are going to work together instead of just saying “LeBron and AD, duh”.

We know it comes down to the Raptors, Lakers, and Clippers, but with the small amount of leaks and the conflicting information running abuzz, we really don’t know where his mindset is. So let’s look and evaluate his options:


Staying with Toronto- pays him the most if it’s a long-term deal. Already won a championship there and have a good core in place. One of the most stable front offices in the league. A fan base that adores him. A whole country behind him. A good brand move if he wants to continue on as the guy there. Also opens up parity in the league. 

Signing with the Lakers- creates a top-heavy superteam. Kawhi’s hometown. An instant championship favorite if he signs there. Probably the least popular move of the three based on parity. Argument on if it would be Kawhi’s team or not. Gives him Anthony Davis to play with as LeBron ages out in later years. Great winning situation. 

Signing with the Clippers- If Kawhi wants his cake and wants to eat it too. Clippers allows him to be the leader of the team while also playing at home. Great individual brand move. Can battle LeBron for LA. Good supporting cast similar to the Raptors, but probably not the championship favorite. Great proven coach and front office.

**Narrative 1:** Kawhi played up his injury &amp; used it as an excuse to force the Spurs to trade him to either Lakers/Clippers. Toronto Raptors never had a chance to re-sig Kawhi because his uncle already had business plans in Los Angeles that were set up when Kawhi was still in San Antonio.

**Narrative 2:** Kawhi was actually injured &amp; that the Spurs medical staff misdiagnosed the injury. The medical staff cleared him to play, but he knew better that there was something wrong. The Spurs pressured Kawhi to return before he was ready and that pressure soured the relationship between them. Kawhi asked to be traded, and informed the Spurs that his preference was to be traded to LA but that he was always going to be open about whatever team traded for him. 

So what do you think? Is there any connection between Kawhi's FA decision &amp; his soured relationahip with the Spurs? I have few options listed...

- Yes. If Kawhi joins either Lakers/Clippers, it means that he was playing up his injury.

- Yes. But only if he goes to the Lakers then it means that he was playing up his injury

- Yes. But only if he goes to the Clippers then it means that he was playing up his injury

- Yes. If Kawhi decides to re-sign a new deal with Raptors, then it means that he was actually injured as Kawhi mentioned.

So I have to make a post.

I will never forget Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal shitting on advanced stats and analytic nerds on 'Inside The NBA' and how they got rightfully criticized online for it. 'Inside' is barely an analysis shows and we pretty much just watch them for the entertainment, but to me the reason Chuck and Shaq and other players feel that way about analytics is because they do not understand it. Heck, even I am trying to understand them fully up to now.

But I feel like people who dismiss analytics refuse to evolve with the sport as it has been clear for the past years that this is the trend and direction the league is going, so my question is not about the advantages and disadvantages of using (and abusing) analytics in general. Analytics would be and should be a part of the game whether we like them or not. Personally, I am excited as a fan for more analytics to be incorporated in future games and seasons. I'm saying that without pretension because I know I may even be late to the party.

With that being said, in trying to learn analytics I will come across comments and analyses saying something like this stat is weak when it comes to analyzing that, or the other stat does not take into consideration the pacing, or these stats cannot be used to compare eras... basically, there is no be-all, end-all perfect stat and we should use the analytical tools in our disposal vis-a-vis each other in order to understand further the players and the game we love.

The most common things I hear is when a player's offensive/defensive analytics are misleading for reasons and the criticisms of PER (yet it is still being utilized). May y'all please give other examples of a certain stat, maybe say something about its use or purpose (strength), then caution about the things that the particular stat does not take intro credit (weakness)? Examples would be great too. Thank you.

   As a Nets fan, Caris Levert is like the fan favorite and people consider him the best player last year.

In reality, what the Nets have done to accommodate his contract - as well as their previous players DLo, Graham, and Napier - is even more impressive. I also posted this in the Nets subreddit but I think it's so interesting it's worth sharing here as well.

I take no credit for this information - the following chunk of text is a series of tweets by @AlbertNahmad on Twitter, a salary cap enthusiast. He breaks down the incredible salary cap wizardry the Nets will be performing to sign all of their new players without having to trade anyone AND with Kyrie and KD getting virtually all of their max contract money as well. This is incredible stuff.

&gt; Follow the next set of tweets very closely, to see how the Brooklyn Nets will employ salary cap magic on July 6, to squeeze an extra $9.2 million out of thin air!
&gt; 
&gt; The common logic across the NBA community is the Nets did the Warriors a favor by agreeing to take in Kevin Durant via sign-and-trade, vs. simply signing him outright… That’s only half true! Yes, GSW extracted something: D’Angelo Russell. But so did Brooklyn: DeAndre Jordan!
&gt; 
&gt; The Nets were probably planning to sign Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving into cap room. But when DeAndre Jordan became a possibility, they probably then shifted course. They decided to steal the Lakers’ idea!
&gt; 
&gt; The Nets will brilliantly sequence their transactions, in order to increase the combined salary they can give to Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and DeAndre Jordan by a whopping $9.2M… effectively creating cap room out of thin air to cover Jordan’s entire first-year salary!!!
&gt; 
&gt; OK, so how are the Nets going to do it? Here are the steps:
&gt; 
&gt; The Nets will first exhaust all $68.8M of their cap room by signing their free agents and draft picks. They’ll sign D’Angelo Russell, DeAndre Jordan, Nicolas Claxton, and, finally, Kyrie Irving (who will need to take a small discount from his $32.7M max – as little as $420K).
&gt; 
&gt;Think about what just happened… The Nets need $70.0M cap room just to sign Durant ($38.2M) and Irving ($32.7M), let alone add Jordan ($9.3M). They can only create $68.8M, by waiving Napier and Graham (NGs). Instead, they’ll keep Napier, Graham and Russell to exhaust cap room.
&gt; 
&gt;The Nets will then guarantee $3.2M of the combined $3.5M salaries of Shabazz Napier and Treveon Graham, so they’ll count as outgoing salary in trade. They’ll then combine Napier, Graham and D’Angelo Russell to trade-match for… Kevin Durant (who could get his full $38.2M max).
&gt; 
&gt;The Nets will end it all $8.3M over the salary cap – having artificially created $9.2M in cap room by exceeding the salary cap to trade-match for Kevin Durant, rather than sign him outright. And they’ll give that extra money to… DeAndre Jordan!
&gt; 
&gt;And that’s why the Warriors will need to acquire Shabazz Napier and Treveon Graham in the D’Angelo Russell trade, even though their salaries were non-guaranteed. And it’s also why they’ll need to pay the Wolves cash just to get rid of them!
&gt; 
&gt;For those asking: If you follow my tweets closely, you will notice that the Nets will sign D’Angelo Russell into cap room. So BYC will NOT apply. That is the most critical part of this entire story!
&gt; 
&gt;Kevin Durant doesn’t necessarily need to take anything below his $38.2M max to make the math work. Kyrie Irving might need to take as little as $420K less than his $32.7M max. But if he really wants that $420K, he can take it as some sort of unlikely bonus (by signing first)!

This seriously blew my mind. I've been operating with the understanding that KD and Kyrie were both taking around $5m less to fit DJ's salary but the DLo S&amp;T is actually making all of this work for the Nets, while they're also getting a 1st round pick from the Warriors and guaranteeing money for all of these players - including their boys Treveon Graham and Napier.

The 2020 free agent class is crap and GS will struggle to score next season without KD and with Klay out for the first portion of the season.

If D’Lo is average-subpar he still probably has suitors willing to give up some assets.  If D’Lo looks like an All-Star (something I’m really dubious of) GS will have a variety of offers to choose from.

Potentially interested teams and packages;

**Minnesota**- Apparently KAT and D’Lo are really close friends.  Who knows if that is enough to give up a lot of their core for D’Lo but we’ll see.  **Covington, Teague, and Okogie** is probably as much as Minnesota will give up...maybe a first round pick too if they’re desperate.

**NY**- After striking out again in free agency Dolan could absolutely make a play for a 2018 All-star to pair with RJ. **Robinson, Dallas 1st, Bullock(2020 team option), and either Randle or Portis(2020 team option)**.

**Orlando**- They have lacked a solid point guard for a while now.  The Fultz experiment was/is a risk and I was amazed that Phillly was able to get more than a 2nd round pick for a contract they had to unload to open up cap space.  **AG, Fournier, and either Bamba or a protected 1st round pick** could do it.

**Nola**- They have the most assets and could put together the most attractive package.  **Lonzo Ball, Redick, E’Twaun Moore, and a protected first round pick**.

**San Antonio**- I don’t know if D’Lo is a Popovich type of player but he is very talented.  **Derozen, Lonnie Walker/Derrick White, Poeltl** is a package that could be competitive for D’Lo if he doesn’t look great in GS.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,55883,public,self,The trade routes for GS with D’Angelo Russell.,0,1562353169,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/c8v144/the_trade_routes_for_gs_with_dangelo_russell/,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is not ranking who the top 25 were last season, or who will be the top 25 three years from now, it is simply projecting for next season alone.

I have broken my list into tiers to add context. Players in the same tier are fairly interchangeable. I have no problem with someone ranking a player at the bottom of one tier at the top of the same tier. 

Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Khris Middleton, and Demar Derozan are all not included because they played at SF a higher percent of the time last year according to Basketball Reference. I'm not saying they can't play as guards, but for this list I am considering them forwards.

Klay Thompson, Victor Oladipo and John Wall are ommited due to injury.


Tier 1

1. S. Curry

2. J. Harden

These are the two elite guards in my opinion. Still in their prime, both these guys should be considered top MVP candidates next year.

Tier 2

3. D. Lillard

4. K. Irving

5. B. Beal

6. K. Walker

All these guys are perennial all stars and top 20 players in the NBA. 

Tier 3

7. L. Doncic

I have Luka in a tier by himself. I love Doncic, and think he will be an MVP candidate in the near future. I just couldn't rank him above the proven perennial all stars in the tier above just yet. I do think he will build on his stellar rookie season and be an all star level player next season.

Tier 4

8. R. Westbrook

9. B. Simmons

Both incredible guards who can't shoot. I would personally rather build around all the players listed above them for next year simply due to their inability to space the floor. Still excellent players who are amazing to watch and do alot of things exceptionally well. 

Tier 5

10. J. Holiday

11. D. Mitchell

12. D. Russell

13. M. Conley

14. CJ McCollum

These guys are low level all star guards. Mitchell and Russell have the potential to move up a tier, but I have to see it before I can rank them any  higher. 

Tier 6

15. C. Paul

16. D. Fox

17. K. Lowry

18. D. Booker

This is a mix of old guys who I think will fall just below all star level, and young guys who have yet to prove themselves in the playoffs. Fox is the guy to watch. He could easily out play this ranking. 

Tier 7

19. B. Hield

20. J. Murray

21. C. LeVert

22. M. Brogdon

23. L. Williams

These guys are high level starters. If they are the third best player on your team I think you are in great shape. 

Tier 8

24. J. Richardson

25. E. Bledsoe

I consider both these guys as solid starters. Very good defenders and can be a third or fourth  scoring option on a contender.

I completely disagree, in fact I think they totally messed up. 

This isn't about signing KD to a 5 year deal after he got an injury that almost everybody comes back from as a shell of their former selves (even though that was dumb too, he should have gotten a demarcus cousins deal).

 This is about letting D'lo go for Kyrie. 

D'lo just finished his 4th season at age 22. So I compared it to Kyrie's 4th season, also when he was 22 years old. 

**In their 4th season at 22 years old:**

Kyrie had **21.7 ppg** on **36 minutes/game.** D'lo had **21.1 ppg** on **30 minutes/game**.

D'lo averaged **7 assists** vs. Kyrie's **5.2 assists**, with a 41% assist rate vs Kyrie's 25%. 

Kyrie was slightly more efficient with **58% TS** vs. D'lo's **53% TS**. But D'lo had a **higher usage %** of just over 30% vs. Kyrie's 26%. 

Kyrie got to play alongside **LeBron as the #1 option**, whereas D'lo **was** the #1 option.

As far as the numbers go, D'lo is looking really close to Kyrie at the same point in their careers. The nets have a bunch of young players who could have developed alongside him and built something special in an organic way. D'lo showed some leadership potential bringing this team on a playoff run where they were a really tough lower seed. Instead of keeping an exciting young team together with what seemed like a really strong and positive culture, the nets decided to rush the timeline and got Kyrie and KD purely for marketing purposes. Kyrie just failed miserably to be the leader of a **way more talented** group of young players in Boston. This has a very high potential to turn out very badly. 

Based on brand value they had a great offseason, because they signed two household names who will sell tickets and jerseys. But in terms of basketball it was a disaster, and in 3-4 years it will be looked back on as a terrible offseason. Especially since D'lo is going to look really, really good playing next to Curry and Klay.

People underestimate how important athleticism is in regards to muscle memory. LeBron in his prime had a 44 inch vertical for example. If an injury took it down to 38 instantly, he'd still be very athletic, but that's now 6 inches off of his layups, jump shots, fadeaways etc that he has to adjust for in relatively speaking, what is a short amount of time. So even if post injury he's still athletic relative to the rest of the league, it would still be a big change for him personally. It's not like athleticism and skill are used separately when playing, it's a continuum in which every player finds themselves relying on both.

In regards to KD, yes he's a 6'11 small forward, but now he's a 6'11 small forward that's going to get less lift, not be able to blow by people as quickly, get less separation with his handle, have trouble accelerating and decelerating etc. His height is still advantageous, but it's not like KD is as good as he was JUST because of his height, he had the guard like quickness and agility to accompany it. So saying he's going to be exactly the same after an achilles rupture is just incredibly wishful thinking to me. 

Equating him to Cousins also seems inaccurate. Cousins is a big man, KD is a wing, and whilst he can play a small ball 4 their styles are still different. Quick off the dribble mid range J's weren't exactly Boogies bread and butter like with KD. His game relied on positioning and strength, and even when he drived from the perimeter in the half court, he didn't need to get much if any separation from his man and could just use his muscle, unlike KD.

Furthermore, people seem to be just forgetting that this isn't his first injury. He's previously suffered a Jones fracture, and and an ankle injury. So we'll be getting a 32 year old KD coming off of his 3rd injury. It's not like I want KD to fail either btw, I wish he could come back 100%, the man plays beautiful basketball, but there's just not a historic precedent for such optimism I feel. Elgin Baylor, Chauncey Billups, Isiah Thomas, Kobe, Cousins, Rudy Gay, Verejao, Wesley Mathews, Brandon Jennings etc, none of em looked the same after their injuries.

The 4 forward line-up with no guards of consequence is pretty odd. If rumors about Iggy being bought out and heading to LA prove true, then the team's best 5-man line-up will not include a single guard. The seemingly obvious solution to this situation would be to trade Kuzma for a guard.

However; there is essentially no possible trade in which Kuz gets moved for a starting caliber guard. Kuzma is making less than 2 mil a year and the lakers don't have any other tradeable contracts so he pretty much has to be traded for someone on their rookie deal or a similarly small contract.

The only 2 trades that I could find that even sniff at being reasonable would require Western Conference rivals to help them out. The Nuggets (Beasley and Morris) and the Spurs (Murray and White) both have guards that would potentially be helpful starting guards for the Lakers that make little enough to be traded. The Nuggets have Milsap and MPJ so they seem super duper unlikely as a partner. The Spurs seem enthusiastic about their guards of the future and hate the Lakers but they don't have much in terms of a long term plan at PF so they are only super unlikely.

The only hope for adding another tradeable contract is KCP whose early bird rights they have. I honestly don't really understand early bird rights, but regardless I don't think KCP would sign knowing he'd be traded in a few months and I don't know if the Lakers would just lie to Klutch to get it done.

I have to move ona nd for the better, but I get annoyed hearing the recent trade rumors and Rich Bucher on live TV calling him a younger Nick Young.

    I agree D lo has legit concerns and it sucks cause the guy's talent is undeniable. I for one believe if he leanrs to be careful, he can be the best passer in the league next two Ben Simmons. The guy is a magician when he wants. Secondly, the advanced stats and analyitcal arguments just need to stop bashing him. I keep saying it, D lo won us about seven to even more than ten games just on him. It gets annoying when people say he got lucky cause of injuries that I will get back into later. The guy didn't do it all by himself, but tis annoying to say he got carried. Without his scoring, esepecially when we needed it, we wouldn't be here.

   THis goes to my next point. I have to support Levert and Dinwiddie, but I won't lie and say I get bugged about the viewpoints from NBA fans and our own fanbase when its them and D lo. I heard RIch Bucher say D lo got lucky cause of the injuries of Levert and Dinwiddie. To be fair, all three are not proven and should be like that. I already see the narratvies change Levert is for sure better cause of that one playoof series. I get annoyed by that cause he was terrible for a good part of the last stretch of the season a long with Dinwiddie. If Levert is better I have to admit or even Din, but it is jsut not fair to diminish D lo that he wouldn't be good or was good with them. he had times where he showed he could play with them and when Levert was good in the start of the year, D lo wasn't even that bad. But like with D lo, I keep saying he only had a good 50 game sample size, but Levert literally had one good 14 game stretch earlier last eyar and five games in the playoffs. 

 I just find it annoying and coddling for me. I can give you DInwiddie did look like he could get D lo, but he was also inconsistent for many times this year and the injury excuse shouldn't be mentioned. I also still stand D lo still ahs the most potential. His offensive skillsets are just something you can't ignore. The problem with Levert and Dinwiddie arguments, is they keep pointing out how they are better at the rim and better stats and effieceny, but they don't point out skill. D lo needs to work, and his fnishing is the one thing that seirusly pisses me off, cause he would be amazing if he could even be average from there. Dinwiddie and Levert are jsut guys who I don't think have that offensive skillset that D lo has where he can score from anywhere and has a bunch of moves in his arsenal. Like Levert and Din are just an example of safe predctions cause there offesnive game is all on attacking the rim or shooting threes. They can be great if they prove it but what seperates Kawhi, Lebron, KD, Steph, or Kyrie is they can score from anywhere. They are just too predictablea nd annoys me when fans don't acknoledge, D lo's ability for that.

According to Utah Jazz reporter for The Athletic Tony Jones, the Jazz plan to have Bojan in the starting lineup, with Joe Ingles providing firepower off the bench. However, the plan is to have both Bojan and Ingles in the lineup when closing games.

What do you guys think of this move by Utah? Obviously Jeff Green has his inconsistencies but I *love* the move. He's a good fit at the PF spot that provides offense and spacing, is solid at defense.

So asides improving depth at other positions, we still crucially need another PF. He'd start, but barring injuries wouldn't be playing THAT major of minutes.

While the recently signed Ed Davis can play Power Forward for short periods of time, Tony Jones said the intention for the Davis signing was primarily targetting the Center spot (obviously).

- - - - -

With the Bogdanovic and Davis signings, the Utah Jazz can only pay minimums for the incoming Free Agents. Tony Jones is a trustworthy Jazz reporter, so I'll take his word for the information I stated before.

Very interesting to brainstorm who we could sign for the minimum:

• Both Jeff Green and Marcus Morris would be ideal additions, but I do not think they would take the minimum to join the team (I think one of them joins the Lakers)

• I think a realistic suggestion would be Jamychal Green. With the Orlando Magic signing Al-Farouq Aminu I think it's unlikely they try to keep Green, but he could also sign the minimum to a bigger contender (like the previously mentioned Lakers) or a bigger contract with a different team.

• Not a big fan of Markieff Morris. While I haven't watched a lot of him the past year, he was bad with the Thunder from what I've heard, but then again maybe it was just the fit. Still, he'd be better than nothing.

Just throwing out random names now, most of which are not starting calibre, but I just like listing some additional names

• Jarell Martin played sub 23 minutes with the Grizzlies 2 seasons ago but I haven't followed him at all since then.

• I liked Michael Beasley when he was with the Knicks but I doubt he comes here. Besides, didn't his performance drop off with the Lakers?

• Darius Miller is more of a SF, and he's not starting calibre.

• Sam Dekker?

• Wilson Chandler only played ~50 games last season and didn't look fantastic at all. Not to mention the constant injury issues

Conley/Bojan/Mitchell/Jingles/Davis/Gobert/O’Neal 

0. The addition of Conley and Bojan, taking the place of Rubio and Favors. It’s not just an increase in talent, but an increase in fit as well. 

1. So until something changes- Joe Ingles is as a starting 4? I don’t mind it in most matchups- only a few 4s will really threaten this. 

2. Is anybody else just super freaking excited to see Mitchell and Gobert have some breathing room? These moves could facilitate leaps for both of them offensively. 

3. I’m incredibly excited to see this team executing their well schemed basketball with even more talent offensively. Conley and Bojan both really suit their style and can help them take it further. Have the Jazz ever had three shooters on the floor at once? 

4. This team is gonna continue to be really, really good defensively- Having Oneal in their pocket will be very useful come playoff time. 

5. I’m really curious about this team- in that they’re just loaded with these above average, useful players, and no classic type of superstar. 

But, they’re very deep, and imo very complimentary. I’m super curious what their ceiling will be- because I’m wondering if they’re not looking like a potential best team in the league- depending on how the Lakers fill out.

This team excites me most of all because, in an offseason with all these big markets chasing star players- here’s a small market team with a great coach building a very throwback, Spurs/Pistons type of title contender full of underrated players. 

Gobert, Boban, Conley, Mitchell, Ingles. So much talent without the type of offensive superstar that has dominated the league for years.

They give up all their assets to create a shit ton of cap space and then try to make the biggest of splashes in free agency. That’s not sustainable. Top players don’t usually sign with bad teams that have no assets.

Other successful teams have all done the opposite. Build a roster via the draft, develop young and cheap talent, and just embrace being a shit-tier team for a while. Cleveland did it to draft Kyrie, bring LeBron back, and trade for Love. LA used it to land LeBron, trade for AD, and now have a decent shot at Kawhi. It’s how Brooklyn got Kyrie and Durant. Sometimes you get really lucky like Golden State and build a dynasty BEFORE even landing a top free-agent. In any regard, it doesn't happen overnight. But teams like the Knicks act like it does.

The Knicks start that process but then always cash in too early. They sent Porzingis, Hardaway, Lee, and Burke for a couple of picks and some veteran players at the end of their contracts. That move made them cash-rich for free agency, but at the cost of sacrificing a foundation for future success that they can rely on. What happens when they strike out?

That cap space is now going to $110m tied up in three power forwards on short-term deals. No doubt when those two-year contracts expire they will try to make another huge splash in free agency and go after a guy like Giannis. But when that time comes, they again will have all the money in the world to spend but likely few assets under their control. See the pattern?

Drafting RJ Barrett is the most important part of their offseason so far. But imagine if they also still had Porzingis returning. That would be something to build off of.

Instead the Knicks dump assets for cash and bank on “it’s New York” and “playing in the Garden” to recruit talent instead of actually building something valuable that they can control. You can’t trade the Big Apple and you can’t build around the Garden, because all of that pales in comparison to having a solid team and assets.

The Knicks have to embrace the suck and develop a cheap, talented roster instead of trying to solve all of their problems at once. That’s the only way to have the money to pay free agents AND have the means to attract them in the first place.

**TL;DR:** The Knicks strategy of dumping salary and putting all of their eggs into the basket of free agency is why they always strike out, because it never gives top free agents any *reason* to sign with them.

While what happened to the New York Knicks is a lesson in how tanking and clearing cap space doesn't guarantee anything, existing NBA Rules are partially to blame for this and what happened to the Knicks is bad for the NBA.  

&amp;#x200B;

While you can point to glaring flaws in the organization, the truth is the decisions made by the Knicks were motivated out of incentives built into the NBAs rules around low performing teams and cap space.  While the lottery system makes top draft picks not guaranteed to lower performing teams it does give them better chances to get higher picks.  On top of that, rules surrounding cap space prevent the league from falling out of balance also give incentive for teams to dump assets in preparation to make big moves, such as aggressively pursuing top talent in free agency.  

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the day, while the NBA is a business, it is the job of the organization to make it a great experience for the fans, and the goal of the rules should be to keep the NBA as competitive and ""fair"" as possible.  Who suffered the most this summer?  It's not the Knicks, it's the fans.  

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my proposed changes to make the NBA a more competitive environment and a better experience for fans:

&amp;#x200B;

1.  Give incentives to low performing teams BASED ON PERFORMANCE CRITERIA.   In other words, give incentive to low performing teams who are competitive as possible given their shortcomings.  The metrics needed to implement a system like this would be complicated but likely an inventory of player satisfaction, a way to determine when teams\\coaches are performing better than expected, teams that show progression in improving, etc.
2. Give teams ways out of bad contracts or adjust contracts to pay based on performance.  Teams such as the Timberwolves should not be prevented from making moves to improve their roster due to bad contracts.  I know the players association would hate this, but it is not a good experience for the fans when players offered massive chunks of cap space and under perform or are complete busts end up locking a team into bad performance.  
3. Adjustments to cap space rules to prevent dumping assets before making major moves.  Mavs fans are stoked to have gotten Porzingis but there is no world in which this gamble was good for that org or for the fans.  I am admittedly not the expert on this side of the business but I am sure there are ways to adjust this to prevent asset dumping, especially if teams have outs for bad contracts.  
4. Teams who persist in bad management should be forced to make organizational changes.  I don't know exactly what rules would be needed, but based on my first suggestion, teams who persist in bad management should be forced to make changes.  

&amp;#x200B;

These are just some ideas, but at the end of the day, I feel case studies such as the Knicks are a clear example of how when an organization has incentive to make bad decisions and end up getting punished for it, it is the fans that suffer the most.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,54543,public,self,How to Fix NBA Tanking (KNICKS Case Study),0,1562170712,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/c8b782/how_to_fix_nba_tanking_knicks_case_study/,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reason why the Lakers are such a big risk are because of the lack of depth. If one of those guys goes down with injury, who's stepping up? Having 3 stars is great but i feel like having 2 stars and quality depth is better.

If he goes back to Toronto he'll have the same core, same great coach, and wont have to worry about chemistry issues. I do feel that the only team that is a serious serious threat to them is the Bucks. 

The Celtics got a bit weaker after Al and Kyrie left, the 76ers lack high level perimeter play after losing both JJ and Butler. and the Pacers success revolves on how well Oladipo bounces back from injury. 

So what about the Clippers. 

I feel the Clippers are a good team but their best player in Lou Williams is 32 and will probably start to see some decline within the next 4 years. Pat Bev is very good but hes no star, and Gallinari probably had his best season but is constantly injured. The young guys are good but will they be good enough to help pick up any slack from the veterans as they age?

So basically yea, if Kawhi wants to win another ring, stay 1 more year in Toronto and then you'll have the ability to enter free agency again to better analyze teams like the Lakers, Clippers, or any other team with cap space looking to sign him.

I will lay out my case, but would be interested in hearing a non-Balmer sponsored argument in the opposite direction, if anyone genuinely feels that way.

(note: for the purpose of this, I am assuming that Danny Green comes back with Kawhi, as reports are that he is holding off his decision until Kawhi decides, meaning that if Kawhi returns, he will be part of the supporting cast)


Defense (Raptors): The hallmark of the Raptors in the playoffs was their elite defense. Aside from Kawhi, they have Gasol (a former DPTY, who is still an elite defender), Ibaka (3 time defensive first team, two time blocks leader), and Danny Green (made all defensive second team in 2017). They did not have a single minus defender in their playoff rotation, and arguably their second best perimeter defender (OG Anunoby) missed the whole playoffs with appendicitis this year.

Defense (Clippers): On the Clippers side, they have one player who made an all-defense team (Patrick Beverly in 2017), and no one else who really qualifies as an elite defender. They also have multiple minus defenders in their rotation including Lou Williams (-2.6 DBPM last year) and Danilo Gallinari (-1.3 DBMP last year), who need to be covered up.

Shooting (Raptors): The Raptors also had a pretty unique lineup, in that every single player in their rotation could stretch the floor to behind the three point line. The Raptors had snipers like Danny Green (45.5% from 3, second best in the league), Kyle Lowry (career 36.7% from 3) and Fred VanVleet (career 39.4% from 3). But, more importantly, every single big man on the team could also shoot respectfully, including Pascal Siakam (36.9% from 3), Ibaka (career 35.7% from 3) and Marc Gasol (44.2% this past year from 3).

Shooting (Clippers): The Clippers have some good shooters, but also have some guys who can't shoot the three at all, which affects their spacing. In particular, Montrezl Harrell has attempted 32 threes in his 4-year career, hitting at a rate of 15.6%. Zubac has only attempted 4 threes in his whole career.

Young Talent (Raptors): The Raptors' young talent is highlighted by Pascal Siakam, the year's most improved player. Most seem to concur that he will probably be an all-star as early as this coming season, and will almost certainly make some all-defence teams in his career. Along with that, everyone saw how good Fred VanVleet is in the Finals. He even got a Finals MVP vote. He is a sniper from 3, who is a bulldog defender (watch the clip of him effectively defending Giannis, despite giving up about a foot of height, if you don't believe me). OG Anunoby missed the playoff with appendicitis, but is a guy who has a ton of upside offensively, and is already a top level perimeter defender. Norman Powell is a solid rotation player, who always steps up come playoff time.

Young Talent (Clippers): Montrezl Harrell is a good center, albeit is limited in the modern game because of his inability to shoot the 3. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is a great young point guard, but is only in his second year, and is only 20 years old (and therefore several years from his prime), so may not be ready to be a running mate for Kawhi just yet. Shamet and Zubac are solid rotation players, but don't seem to have the ceiling to evolve much past that.

Head to Head: The Raptors and Clippers played twice this past year, and, coincidentally enough, Kawhi sat for the first of those games for load management. December 11th, the Raptors went into the Staples Center and blew out the Clippers 123-99. With Leonard, and at home, the Raptors also did similarly, blowing out the Clippers 121-103, in a game which was not as close as the score suggests (the Clippers made it tighter in garbage time after the Raps put in the third string). It should be noted that both of these games happened before the Tobias Harris trade.

​

The Clippers have an excellent coach and overachieved with a roster that doesn't have a lot of talent. They stole a couple of games against a Warriors team that took them for granted (especially in the 30+ point comeback game, where the Warriors took their foot of the pedal a little too early). But, that doesn't make them a championship contender if they just add Kawhi. They are a team with real flaws, and real holes, and without any current stars to help cover those up.

Kawhi on the Clippers would make a solid playoff team, but not nearly as good as the Raptors were this past year. They also have the misfortune of being in the West, which is absolutely stacked right now. If they add Kawhi, are the Clippers better than the LeBron-AD Lakers? Probably not. Are they better than the Rockets? Probably not. Are they better than the Jazz? Probably not. Are they better than the Nuggets? Probably not. And, that's before even getting into solid existing playoff teams like OKC, Portland, Golden State (especially once Klay is back) and the Spurs. And, it is also before getting into young up and coming teams who could take a large step forward this year like Dallas, Sacramento and the Pelicans.

While I love Kawhi, if he goes to the Clippers, I think it is pretty likely that they don't even get home court advantage in the playoffs, and they probably don't win more than one round.

--------
1. JORDAN PLAYED IN AN EXPANSION ERA.

Firstly, Jordan played (and mostly won) championships during an expansion era of the league. Yes, believe it or not, Michael Jordan played during an era where the league was still trying to find its own identity and incorporate different cities of America into the league. Because of this, Jordan played against some of the worst competition the league has ever seen, owning some of the worst records in NBA history that still stand today. During his career, 6 sub .500 teams were added to the league, which in turn, diluted an already inferior talent pool within the early stages of the league development.

 

2. RULE CHANGES

As we’ve already established, the league was still discovering itself and developing during MJ’s career, and as a part of that development, league rules were also a central part of that change. Now, I know what some of you are thinking, but before you start yell “hand checking, hand checking”, keep in mind, Jordan played during a time where the illegal defense rule existed. This is massive because hand checking is really nothing in comparison. The magnitude of the rule doesn’t compare to the significance of the illegal defense. Without the ability to play a zone defense or anything close to it, defensive schemes were less elaborate and teams were unable to send or even show multiple bodies at stars. Can you imagine a league nowadays in which superstars were left with single man coverages? That was the reality. Can you imagine players like Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Kevin Durant etc being able to basically go one-on-one with a defender who has been left there on an island with no hope in stopping them? It’s crazy when you think about that now in that light. Can you imagine some of the numbers the more modern superstars could have put up with that luxury.

3.  MAJOR STATISTICS INDICATE IT WAS IN FACT AN INFERIOR ERA AS WELL

You’d think that if the assumption Jordan played in a better era the numbers would back that up, right? Well they in fact do the opposite. Major stats taken across the board for the duration of his career indicate that Jordan did in fact play in an inferior era to today’s game. The overall Points Per game average was higher despite the fast-paced, more possessions per game we experience today. The Field Goals Made per game was higher, Field Goals attempted across the board were higher on average again despite the supreme pace we see night in and night out nowadays. The overall Field Goal Percentage was also higher. All in all, saving you some reading time, advanced stats are also not favorable. Not to mention basically everything that has to do with outside shooting, the three-point line and overall efficiency being better today.

4. INDIVIDUAL DEFENSE/DEFENSES

This is obvious, but simply put – individual and overall defense were less advanced when Jordan played. I often hear people claiming Jordan “would average 50 in this era”, but let’s be real, he wouldn’t average 50 (no one could do that), and even if he did average a high points per game average, it would be down to the increased pace and more possessions, not because the defenses or defensive players are worse now, because they’re not.

5. JORDAN PLAYED FOR A HALL-OF-FAME HEAD COACH, AND WAS A PART OF THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS OF THEIR GENERATION

It’s no secret Jordan destroyed the competition, but it’s very interesting when they praise Jordan for dominating, but discredit today’s competition in comparison. It’s interesting because what people fail to realise is that Jordan played in the 90s version of the Golden State Warriors that we see tear apart the league today. Jordan’s Bulls were absolutely the equivalent in their era. Of course both teams were built and constructed differently, but their dominance and status were the same.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,54130,public,self,"The Biggest Myth In NBA History; Michael Jordan Played Against A Stronger Era and would average ""50"" Today",0,1562116429,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/c82v43/the_biggest_myth_in_nba_history_michael_jordan/,,,,,,,,,,,,

But I was wondering: if he *really* wanted to go to the Lakers, wouldn't he be doing himself a huge disfavor by letting all the other teams make their moves, sign the role players available out there while time is ticking away for the Lakers? He may have said that he wouldn't be talking to teams before today but he also isn't stupid and he knows that other teams won't kindly wait for him to make a decision before engaging free agents on the market.

I also think that if he truly wants to be a Laker he would already have made up his mind at this point. He either wants to play with LeBron and AD and he wants to be part of a SUPER super-team, while being one of *three* main guys and also while accepting what this could potentially do to his reputation, *or* he feels like he wants to be the alpha player like he was in TOR or like he could be for LAC. 

I don't think his talks with the Lakers can have all that much impact on his decision whether to join them or not - he knows what they have to offer and the longer he waits, the less they will be able to put on the table once he'd potentially join them. 

Again, I am just as clueless as anyone else but I would find it very strange of him to hold his future team hostage while diminishing their chances of getting a decent supporting cast should he decide to join.

**Current Depth Chart**
Point Guards: Dennis Smith Jr., Frank Ntilikina, Elfrid Payton
Shooting Guards: RJ Barrett, Allonzo Trier, Reggie Bullock, Daymean Dotson, Wayne Ellington
Small Forwards: Kevin Knox, Daymean Dotson, Reggie Bullock, Ignas Brazedikis (most likely g-league)
Power Forwards: Julius Randle, Taj Gibson
Centers: Mitchell Robinson, Bobby Portis

**Key Players:**
• *RJ Barrett*: Despite being a rookie, he could be seen as the soon to be messiah of the Knicks. Barrett seems like a born leader and will be a top 3 option offensively with his keen isolation and passing skills.
• *Mitchell Robinson*: Already touted as a major steal from the 2018 Draft, Robinson will be the protector in the paint for New York and will be essential in slowing down team's production in the paint.
• *Julius Randle*: Randle could be the best Knicks player next year as his point-forward skills could help give life to a somewhat stagnant and discombobulated Knicks' offense.

**Key Strengths and Weaknesses**
- Strengths: Knicks have length at every position and have tremendous upside from their young guys. Chemistry and motivation by players hasn't been this good in years.. :) They have decent depth at each position but the PG slot.
- Weaknesses..: Lack of experience will prove a challenge in ladder parts of the season. Defence is still iffy and lack defensive versatility. No true floor general that can control the tempo and offense.

But to be honest, I understand. I don't blame my fellow Hornets fans as they have been through the ringer. I mean with all these 1st round top 10 picks and only Kemba to show for it and now we gave him up. And now the addition of Terry Rozier for 20M a year. By all means to Hornets fans have the right to be upset. 

I want to shed some light on the awful situation and share why I don't find all these moved that bad.

1.) I dont think losing Kemba was bad at all. I actually think it was good

I love Kemba and it's easy to be mad when a great player such as him leaves your team when he is the last sting of hope left, but what's the point? We have not broken .500 in the past 3 years and even with the incredible talent of Kemba he alone cannot bring the Hornets to anything worthwhile. Another year with the Hornets for Kemba is another year wasted in his prime. I am happy he is with the Celtics because they consistently make the playoffs and can provide him more success. 

2.) Aquiring Terry R. Isn't that bad. Not great but just not bad

Scary Terry was acquired from a sign and trade not from free agency. This is commonly known but sign and trades are beneficial to players and teams as teams get something out of the player and the player gets a much larger contract than if they went to free agency. Hornets knew that Kemba was going to Boston so the best piece they could get out of the deal was Terry (hopefully some picks get included as well). In the end yest the Hornets agreed but it was either Terry or nothing.

Also is 58M way to much for Terry Rozier? Of course it is, I wouldn't give him half that but the Hornets aren't in a place to need or want to sign great free agents as they still have a lot of young players they need to develop so that was money not being spent. If I could I would love Julius Randle over Terry R. but there is not a many free agents who want to sign with the Hornets right now I mean.... come on.  As well as Nic Batum played barely slightly better than Terry last year and gets paid significantly more yet, no one makes the comparison so I will do it

Terry Rozier 9/4/3 on 22 mins a game 58M
Nic Batum last year 9/5/3 on 31 mins a game at 125M and is getting 27M this year

Mitch (Lakers GM for 17 years) has some experience I would say and sees some good things in Terry and is the reason why the Hornets took such a big contract for him

Overall. It was either Terry or nothing for Kemba and we weren't going to spend that money anyways

3.) Lastly check out the young core! I am actually excited for this young group. The Hornets plan on starting Terry and he still young and has shown flashes of promise. He will be much better than people think.

Devonte Graham will come off the bench also who had a couple flashes last year and is very young

Malik Monk who has had a rough few years getting into the season will probably be coming of the bench again. His usage will be up however and I think that's what will make him progress

Miles Bridges in his sophomore season coming off a decent freshman year looks to take a starting role but possibly behing MKG

PJ likely coming off the bench behind Marvin until he proves he is a starter has a lot of promise

SO many young guys and there are flashes of promise in a lot of them. I am excited to see these guys progress as they are going to be forced to fill in starting roles and get a lot of minutes.

Anyways that's what I got. Disagree, agree, tell me I'm wrong, whatever works. Hornets haven't lost me yet and I don't think they get paid as well as they do to be inept.

I just wanted to comment on what I think about this and ask some questions also about why some teams may be higher/lower.  
Lakers+150 -- I think the Lakers are given this favorite status as a hedge against the risk that the Lakers pulled something amazing off like signing Kawhi then filling out the roster with bargains. I feel like the Lakers are actually likely to be 4-8 seed and not a serious title contender. The lack of depth, risk of a single injury making them a lotto team, lack of outside shooting, really puzzles me how people can seriously think the Lakers have this good of odds to win.   
Bucks+650 -- They lost Brogdon but it won't really matter that much. This team is likely to look the same as last year. If Giannis developed a consistent shooting game then I can see them winning it all.  
Warriors+1000 -- I have this question - why did GS sign Russell to an expensive long term contract when they're gonna have Klay back by May? He's a good player but I don't see the fit for Warriors. They lose Durant, won't have Klay(and not at full strength if he comes back for playoffs), lose Iguodala, gain Russell. This does not seem like the best team in the west at all. If the Warriors were to win this coming season I think most people would be surprised as shit, so in reality I think they are more like 25-1 odds.   


76ers+1000 -- Bit low if you ask me, aside from Milwaukee and the Jazz this is the only team that doesn't really have much question marks going into next season. They made their moves in free agency, they did very well to retain talent, and they are pretty much done. So I think they should be rated even at 6.5-1 with Milwaukee.  


Rockets+1200 -- This team has been and still is pretty damn good. They have pushed the Warriors to their limits in each of the last 3 seasons. Those Warriors teams were some of the best teams composed of all time. 2019 Warriors would have beat Toronto in 4 or 5 games if they had Durant and Klay the whole time. And Toronto at full health barely eeked out the series win with those 2 gone. So I want to say this -- the Rockets have been and will continue to be a flipping good team and should be the title favorite going into next season as long as they either stay pat or improve on the roster. Keep Capela. This team was competitive with the most talented squad of all time. I don't know what else to say. Should be +500 imho(not a rockets fan btw).  
Clippers+1200 -- Whether they land Kawhi or not, do also consider that this team pushed the full strength Warriors to 6 games in the first round. If Clippers had played Raptors in Finals. maybe they could have won even. They were pretty good. My bet is they improve more through FA, but even if they continued with a similar roster to last season I think they deserve a 12-1 odd.   
Raptors+1400 -- I think this is a high rating. Why? Because the Raptors WITH KAWHI barely beat the Warriors when they were missing 2 of their best players. They got the luckiest bounce I've ever seen to close out Milwaukee too. Obviously it was a good team, but even if they retained Kawhi then I think they should be 14-1 odds, if they lose him then I see them as not a serious contender.  


Jazz+1400 -- I'll admit I'm a lifelong Jazz fan, but this team on paper has to be at least top 5. They were already a very good team last year and they made moves that improved substantially in their weakest areas by adding Bogdanovic and Conley(2 very good players). As is, they kind of remind me of the Magic team that had 4 snipers + Howard that beat Lebron in the east conference finals way back when. We do have to actually see this team prove itself, but they really do have very few question marks as is and great upside with Mitchell entering his 3rd year. +650 seems more accurate, but tell me why I'm wrong if you think I am.   
Nuggets+1800 -- Probably most people would agree that this team is a little something(add one all-star) away from being good enough to win it all. They were regular season darlings really but just got their asses handed to them in the playoffs by a trailblazers team that wasn't really anything special either.   


Celtics+2500 -- Walker is incredible, maybe this team surprises with improved chemistry by removing the narcissistic assholes they lost in FA.  
Nets+2500 -- Next season they're contenders just due to pure talent of a healthy Durant+KD and a deep roster to support them. Obviously not this year.  
   
Thunder+3000 -- Likely another year of the same Westbrook jacking up 30-40 questionable shots a game.

Orlando Magic: I find it really impressive that the Magic managed to retain both Vucevic and Ross, both of whom seemed to be in really high demand this off-season. They have some talented young players, all of whom they managed to retain, and also added some experience in Al-Farouq Aminu for a position which they seemed to lack depth in. If there's still any chance that Markelle Fultz is able to fix his shot and show his potential, the Magic seem like a team who should lock their Playoff spot once again.

Sacramento Kings: Dewayne Dedmon is a fantastic addition. He's been adding a 3-point shot to his game over the last 2 seasons(he shot 38% on 3.4 3-point attempts last season), which could make him fit really well along with the Kings for the upcoming season. They also picked up a really solid 3&amp;D vet in Ariza who should fit the team and their offensive style really well. I think Barnes had a good run with the Kings and he should be able to flourish in their system. It seemed unlikely for Sacramento to land a big-name free agent, so getting Barnes is still good for them.

More importantly, however, is that DLo’s contract is for 4 years. Now, it’s unclear whether he will actually be here long term or if he’ll be a trade piece next year, but I would like to point out one very interesting part of this trade:

Russell is only 23 and is fresh off an allstar season after largely being considered a bust.

Of course, fans tend to overreact when young guys don’t immediately pan out. Russell really came into his own this past year in Brooklyn but he did have some flaws, namely streaky shooting, decision-making, and terrible defense. Ironically enough, these things happen to be things that the Warriors current backcourt players know how to do very well. Additionally, Russell has shown that he has a strong work ethic and is willing to do what it takes to improve. My theory is that Steph and Klay will help DLo make strides to improve his weakest areas

So by the end of his Warriors tenure, we could see D’angelo Russell emerge as a toned-down embodiment of the Steph/Klay backcourt in the form of a single guard: Steph’s offensive prowess, Klay’s defensive prowess, and of course, their shooting.

At this point I'd say that in the West the Lakers, Rockets, Warriors, Trail Blazers, Thunder, and Nuggets all have claim to being contenders. The Clippers (if they sign Leonard), Timberwolves, and Jazz all strike me as dark horses, while the Mavs, Pelicans, and Kings are all young teams that could threaten for the playoffs with a breakout season.

In the East the Raps status is fairly tied to Kawhi's decision, but the conference is just as competitive. The Bucks, Sixers, Celtics, and Pacers are all still contenders. The Nets, Heat, and Pistons are all dark horses with star players, while the Hawks strike me as a team that could improve/surprise this season, similar to last season's Sacramento team.

As I said Kawhi's decision will undoubtedly change opinions, but regardless of where he signs any team has a chance. Even if he joins the Lakers, they will have absolutely zero depth and probably wouldn't be favorites on the same level as the recent Golden State teams.

Conley/Bojan/Mitchell/Jingles/Davis/Gobert 

0. The addition of Conley and Bojan, taking the place of Rubio and Favors. It’s not just an increase in talent, but an increase in fit as well, imo. 

1. So I guess Joe Ingles is as a 4? I don’t mind it, given the size of most NBA 4s in this league. 

2. Is anybody else just super freaking excited to see Mitchell and Gobert have some breathing room?

3. I’m incredibly excited to see this team executing their well schemed, smartboi basketball with better players all around. Conley and Bojan are a huge jump in talent for them.

4. This team is gonna continue to be really, really good defensively- though I could see them struggling with athletic, rangy bigs (e.g. Davis or Giannis)

5. I’m really curious about this team- in that they’re just loaded with these above average, useful players, and no classic type of superstar. 

But, they’re very deep, and imo very complimentary. I’m super curious what their ceiling will be- because I’m wondering if they’re not looking like a potential best team in the league- depending on how the Lakers fill out.

But it also leaves the question if what Jimmy butler is prioritizing with the heat. It certainly isnt rings, because he would have had a better chance at that with the sixers. I mean sure they might be able to get him a number 2 guy next year or one of the current guys to share the load, but a championship with mainly just Jimmy leading the way seems unlikely. 

And for the Sixers? What a terrible offseason so far (imo). They overpaid harris way too much. He isnt 36 mil a year good, more like 25-28 mil a year good. And then on top of that they signed a 34 year old Horford, to a 4 year 110 mil contract. He isnt a bad player by any means, but his prime has come and gone and it's hard to justify signing him to such a large contract. And on top of all of that, they lost JJ Reddick.

I probably would've paid Harris around $25M/year (compared to $36M) and Horford around $15M (compared to $27M/year). Other teams, like the Nets and Knicks, paid for comparable players in terms of hard numbers (Deandre Jordan and Julius Randle, respectively) at much much lower costs.

Additionally, letting Jimmy Butler (who carried this team for many parts of the playoffs) and JJ Reddick go makes me question who the hell are the perimeter shooters for the team. Simmons can't shoot and I don't even know who is the backup SG for the team since they didn't shore up that position. I consider Richardson a SF, not a SG.

This particular plan would also lower the number of regular season games to 70, but you can tweak the concept to get to any number of games.


&amp;nbsp;


**3 ""Rounds"" of the regular season**

**Round 1**

The 30 teams are split into 2 groups (let's call them Group 1A and Group 1B, division between East and West is an obvious choice) of 15 teams each. Each team plays the other 14 teams twice, for a total of 28 games. The bottom half of each group gets sent to Group 2A for Round 2*, while the top half gets sent to Group 2B.

**Round 2**

Each team again plays other group members twice, for another 28 games (total 56 thus far). Group 2A is the ""worse"" group and 2B is the ""better"" one. This time, the bottom 12 teams of Group 2A get sent to Group 3A, in addition to the bottom 3 of Group 2B. The rest of the teams go to Group 3B.

**Round 3**

Final round, each team plays other group members once, for another 14 games (total 70). The top 12 teams from Group 3B qualify for the playoffs. The remaining 3 teams from Group 3B, plus the top 5 teams from Group 3A will have a single elimination ""play-in"" game (or 3 game series) to determine the remaining 4 teams. The 16 team playoffs can then begin regularly, with overall records determining seeding.


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


The idea is that the worse you do in the earlier rounds, the less likely you are to make the playoffs. However, if you have done poorly in the first 2 rounds there is still a chance in round 3, keeping playoffs hopes around for longer. Likewise, even if you have done very well in the first round or two it certainly helps your chances of making the playoffs, but you still have to do well till the end (hopefully keeping up the intrigue of the regular season). This format idea can be tweaked to have other number of groups also.

&amp;nbsp;


Of course there many cons to this format such as scheduling difficulties (due to randomized groups), it is kinda confusing, teams can take it easy once they've guaranteed a spot in the better group (although overall record determining seeding could help slightly), maybe teams might tank in Round 1 if they think it's easier to be top 3 in Group 2A than top 12 in Group 2B, plus others things that I'm not thinking of. I think a flowchart would have made it easier to follow.

Last summer, thirty of us did an all time draft (kind of like a fantasy basketball draft, but with every player in NBA history. I enjoyed it and it seems like a lot of others did too, so I wanted to try and create another similar draft this offseason.

Each person would get one team to manage and we would go in order to draft one player at a time. The draft is a standard snake format and lasts ten rounds. GMs could pick any player who played in the NBA, but would have to select the year they would pick them (for example, you would pick Michael Jordan 1987-1988 or Michael Jordan 1990-1991 instead of just Michael Jordan). Once a player is selected, nobody else can select that player or any other year of that player. Drafting will take place on Google sheets.

Discussion on teams and how they would fare against each other is welcome and always appreciated. If you want to participate, please pm me or comment below which team you would like.

First, with my thoughts on Wiggins. I think that most people have seen his potential and his inefficiency. One of his biggest problems in my opinion is that his role currently is too big. As the second option on the Twolves and their main perimeter threat, he can't really be disciplined for any of his inefficient pull ups because they need his spacing on the floor. I'm unsure if he's a perceived negative asset because of his contract but I don't think they'd have to give up anywhere near what the Nets did to clear Crabbe (2 1sts).

If the Twolves are as hot to trot on Russell as has been reported, they would need to trade Wiggins and these are some trades that would be interesting. 

I could see the Rockets going after him if they miss on Butler, the Pacers if they lose Bojan and determine that Sabonis and Turner can't play together, and the Warriors as a replacement for KD if they can put a sign and trade together for him.

**Minimum guys to fill out the roster**: Some teams with no cap space still need players to contend, and that's the goal here. Look out for this part in the Center market.

**Just give him another shot**: That's a let down player than could comeback in 2019-20, and player should buy his stock while it's down.

**Not cheap, but might be worth it**: That doesn't fit this post all that well, but some players are just no-brainers, hard to get production and have the potential to outplay even a richer deal.

Another post I've made and it's really interesting for this discussion, was post mocking the off-season in order to understand how much money will be available to each tier of players, in order to better predict the contracts:

&amp;nbsp;

Looking for good deals in 2019 FA, be aware that I won't be talking about guys like Patrick Beverley (everyone's talking about him), Brook Lopez, Dewayne Dedmon, Danny Green, and Bojan Bogdanovic because every team is looking at them, and they're in a really high point of their evaluation, which means that they're probably going to come back to earth soon and you'll have overpaid for unsustainable play.

The profile here are under the radar, underrated guys, that might be available for the right price. It contributes if it's original team isn't looking to re-sign them, because that's minus one very important competitor with bird rights.

&amp;nbsp;

#Targeting Point Guards:
---
#Under the radar Free Agents:

*Player name, age on day 1 next season, type of FA, team he lastly played for 

**Ricky Rubio, 29 years old, UFA, Utah Jazz**

It's not a good sign that every team that signed Rubio ended up desperately trying to trade him in order to upgrade the team's ceiling. But Rubio still has good age and he's a really smart player and good at D. Even with it's fit problems, if you can get a low end starter for close to the MLE and you in need in that position, that's worth it. A young team might look into him as well, because of his ability to make teammates better in the regular season.

*My prediction: 8-14 million*

*My prediction: 6-10 million*

**Tyus Jones, 23 years old, RFA, Minnesota Timberwolves**

Tyus just had a really bad year, and that will probably cost him a lot. The Wolves also never looked quite invested in him so the restricted in RFA might not mean that much. A young but already really smart PG, would fit well with a young team.

*My prediction: 5-8 million*

**Austin Rivers, 27 years old, UFA, Houston Rockets**

Rockets probably won't actually re-sign and he showed he can stayed in the court even at the highest level of basketball, an incredible sign for a team that has high aspirations, such as the Lakers, I would also like him on the Warriors. 

*My prediction: 5-8 million*

**Ish Smith, 31 years old, UFA, Detroit Pistons**

Ish runs the backup unit very well, and he made the team look better than Reggie Jackson did imo. He won't age well but on a 2 year contract I think he would be a pretty good back-up. He's more of a regular season guy though and would fit well for those teams fighting to get into the playoffs, he's worth it a Room-MLE.

*My prediction: 4-7 million*

**Nando de Colo, 32 years old, RFA CSKA Moswcow** - Raptors have his rights, thanks /u/cartkp 

After ruling the Euro League for the past 5 years, he's rumoured to be coming back to the NBA. The guy has an euroleague career 65 TS%, is a big enough defender where he'll be able to be hidden on a 2 or 3 because I don't think he can guard NBA 1s. The league just might have gotten it's new FT% leader, De Colo has shot 95% from the line recently. He's a great shooter and will fit well in the league, he's signifficantly better than Teodosic in that matter I believe.

*My prediction: 4-6 million*

**Elfryd Payton, 25 years old, UFA, New Orleans Pelicans**

This might be my favorite one. Payton played really well this year, but got some strange years that kept him . He shot 32% from 3, but he did shot at a bigger volume, and the team played really well with him on the court, while being long enough to give you good flexibility on D. He's not quite on the level where his 3 point shot will be guarded on the playoffs though and that's a worry, but it might be worth to bet on it developing since it appears to be trending that way.

*My prediction: minimum salary - 4 million*

&amp;nbsp;

My favorite fits: Rubio - Suns, Jones - Suns, Rivers - Lakers, Ish Smith - Hornets, de Colo - Lakers, Payton - not sure.

#Just give him another shot

**Jeremy Lin, 31 years old, UFA, Toronto Raptors**

Look, I know he played badly with the Raptors, but with a summer of recovery from his injury, he might comeback to his form of before injury (which was a ruptured patellar tendon, that has a good prognosis of recovery), and you can probably get him as a 3rd string PG right now for the minimum, so it's a low risk, high reward move.

*My prediction: minimum salary*

#Minimum players: best fill-out roster options

**Brad Wanamaker, 30 years old, RFA, Boston Celtics**

He was an elite player in Europe and looked really well in limited minutes with the Celtics, I personally though he gave the C's better minutes than Rozier last year. The Celtics will need cap space and they might just let him go, and imo he could easily be a backup in this league, playing minutes in the playoffs. I would like on almost every team, but what about him with injury-prone, no cap-space Miami Heat?

**MCW, 28 years old, UFA, Orlando Magic**

Wow, he's already 28 years old?? Yeah, but I do think he really rejuvenated his career in the Magic, with great D and stability, and I really like wing sized PGs. I kind of would like to see him in the Shaun Livingston role in the Warriors.

Almost made it: Shabazz Napier, Shane Larkin

#The Investment

**Alex Caruso, 25 years old, RFA, LA Lakers**

The Lakers will need every cap space they can get and even in that case right now they're close to 32.0 million in most accounts, but these accounts don't consider the 550k extra in cap holds if they actually keep Caruso's cap hold instead of trading him. That would bring them to about 1.3 million dollars under the max to give it to a player in 4 years, what would mean close to 5.5 million in money a player would've to give away. That might just not happen if they sign a max player who wants every penny of it and teams should take advantage of  that. Caruso absolutely could have a career as a back-up in this league, he's big and more athletic than he might appear, his 3 point shot is a work in progress, but in a good way. 

#Not cheap, but might be worth it

**Tomas Satoransky 27 years old, RFA, Wizards**

The Wizards will have 95 million dollars on Beal, Wall, Mahinmi, Howard, Hachimura and Troy Brown, that plus re-signing Bobby Portis (who rejected a 12 mi/yr extension byw), Ariza and Bryant, the Wizards just might not have the space to re-sign Sato. A wing sized guard, with great spot-up shooting, cutting and being just a really smart player, Sato is perfect for a contender. I'd throw a front loaded 50 million/4 years contract on him, because I don't believe the Wizards are getting even close to the tax to keep such a team. He fits anywhere but I would love him on  Dallas or even Indiana.

*My prediction: 12-15 million*

#Comments:

Some people suggested George Hill on this one, but I think he'll get a fair contract, he looked good on the bucks and I think many win now teams will look at him if they strike out on Pat Beverley, giving more of a fair contract than a bargain. Unfortunately this post good a bit outdated once Collinson retired. I've uptaded the Caruso situation as well.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
#Targeting Shooting Guards
---
The shooting guard is the position with the lowest average WAR according to Kevin Pelton, the weakest position in the league by a fair amount. If you position yourselve to acquire solid value in this position with short money this means you did a good job, because you'll have more money spent in other positions in the NBA with less scarcity of talent, making your money worth it.

Hornets 

*Mavs*

Pistons

Warriors

*Indiana* (Dipo's coming back in January)

*Lakers*

Memphis

Minnesota

OKC


All these team definitely could use a new 2. Teams in italic will have significant cap space this summer. But if you dont, it's not a problem here, we're finding the right guys for each team.


&amp;nbsp; 

#Under the radar Free Agents

*Player name, age on day 1 next season, type of FA, team he lastly played for*

**Rodney Hood, 27 years old, UFA, Portland Trail Blazers**

The Blazers reportedly know he's out of their league (they'll only have the taxpayer MLE) and pretty much found a replacement for him already, so that's one less contender for the player. He's been quite incosistent but it seems like he found himself in the playoffs. Has a bit of off the court worries but a smart management can deal with that, he has starting level talent, ok defense, and playmaking ability at 6'7"" at a great age and that's a pretty hard thing to get with less than 20 a year. He didn't play well in the regular season though, and that's something I'd alert you: He's a bet. But a lot of teams in this league need to start taking risks in order to be a contender. If you can get him at the MLE (9.2) for multiple years? That's a great bet.

My question for him is what's he looking for? Is it the next 4 years of a contract or a 1 or 2 years of contract in order to prove himself to get the pay day of his life? If it's the second one, he might be the right guy for the **Lakers**. They have plenty of minutes to go around and he'd take a big playmaking role, if he's willing to bet on himself and take a bit less. 

*My prediction: 8-15 million*

**Wesley Matthews, 33 years old, UFA, Indiana Pacers**

I really liked him on the Boston series, he has that set os skills that's essential for a wing, good size, good individual defense, great 3 point shooter, but he might be looking more for his last pay day right now, he'll be 33 next season and really only fits win now teams. But I think he might age well enough to give him a 3 year contract, or maybe a partially guaranteed 3rd year. I'm really not hearing anything about him, I think he went totally under the radar and that he'll get significantly less than I was expecting.

It's hard to put a fit for a guy that fits really anywhere (in terms of playstyle), but I'd really like him on the **Timberwolves**. If OKC could make some trades (like a Steven Adams salary dump) and get a taxpayer MLE they'd be my perfect fit.

*My prediction: 7-10 million*

**Reggie Bullock, 28 years old, UFA, LA Lakers**

Reggie has great size at 6'7"", plays ok defense and his shot is good. He shot 34.3% on the Lakers last year, but he's a career 39+% shooter, so it's pretty likely that he'll regress. Theoretically he fits well anywhere, but I don't quite trust his off ball defense and his basketball IQ that much. I think he'd fit well in **OKC**, with Adams, George and other long defenders to cover up his mistakes.

*My prediction: 4-6 million*

**Garrett Temple, 33 years old, UFA, Indiana Pacers**

Temple plays really good defense and I quite liked him on the Clippers. I think he went under the radar because nobody whatches the Grizzlies + He didn't play that much on the Clippers. But that's alright, with temple you know what you're getting, really good defense with an OK 3 point shot, the enought for some gravity in the playoffs (career 35.3% shooter). He's getting up there in age though, so I'd stick to a 2 year contract with him.

I think he'll be really cheap and considering the **Hornets** situation I think he's a good fit there. Lamb probably isn't coming back.

*My prediction: 4-6 million*

**Wayne Ellington, 31 years old, UFA, Indiana Pacers**

Detroit didn't quite miss Bullock. Ellington gives you 90% of what Bullock did, with better and more agressive off ball movement, but lesser size and defense. I really like the idea for the Warriors to go full offense and just dare team to outscore them. I think Ellington is also quite smart and would fit well in the Warriors, as he's probably looking to an opportunity to get more minutes so he can get that last contract. I'd say the **Warriors** are the perfect fit.

*My prediction: min-5 million*


&amp;nbsp;

#Not cheap, but might be worth it

**Jeremy Lamb, 27 years old, UFA, Charlotte Hornets**

I'm just not seeing a lot of hype around Jeremy Lamb. He pretty much gives you what Hood does with better defense and actual consistency. He's also a great rebounder, and runs pick and roll really well. A (small) wing-sized playmaker with great age. 

The fit is the main reason why I think he's here. He'd fit really well with the Hornets, Pistons (they just need some playmaking), Memphis (they like to acquire these smart deals like Kyle Anderson), Portland, Washington, but none of these teams have cap space! He'd fit well with the Lakers, but I think they will look for either a max guy or cheaper players, Indiana on the long run doesn't makes sense and I don't love the fit in the Mavs (with him taking the ball off Porzingis and Doncic's hands. I just don't see it. The best fit for cap space teams I found was the Kings, but he's kind of too similar to Bogdanovic, and Buddy is the starting 2. I think there's some (like 5%) chance he drops to the MLE. And that would be crazy considering the talent he showed this season.

*My prediction: MLE-17 million.*

&amp;nbsp;

#Minimum players: best fill-out roster options

**Iman Shumpert, 29 years old, UFA, Houston Rockets**

After a not good end of the season with the Rockets, there's a good chance Shumpert ends up traded like a salary and than getting waived, or that's at least what multiple teams are thinking will happen. Otherwise Shumpert is way down in the list of teams priorities in a free agency of 200 players. His market might have dried up if the Rockets can't find a trade possibility and that would be a good opportunity for a lot of teams that need to fill out their rosters. 

**Alex Abrines, 26 years old, UFA, OKC Thunder**

**Where's Alex Abrines??** We haven't received any information about him since he left OKC. He's still a young good shooter with size, and if you can get that at the minimum you've appropiately filled that roster spot. The last I heard [was a report he'd comeback to Barcelona](https://www.eurohoops.net/en/euroleague/892507/alex-abrines-reportedly-in-talks-for-barcelona-return/) but nothing after. I think he can make it in the NBA, I hope he comes back.

**Rodney McGruder, 28 years old, UFA, LA Clippers, but really Miami Heat**

He had a down season after a good 2017-18 season. The reason he's here actually isn't that I think he's a **great** use of a minimum. I think he's ok, but the roster spots in this league are getting really low for the quantity of talent out there. McGruder is a 3 year veteran so he still qualifies for a 2-way contract. In similar way to what the Rockets did with Danuel House, I'd take a seriously look at McGruder as a 2-way player, a really no risk ok reward if when the music stops he's out of chairs.


**BONUS: JR Smith, 34 years old, UFA, Cleveland Cavs**

I think JR still has 1 year in him, and there's a high chance he'll traded and waived or simply waived. A great 3&amp;D in the really early buyout market.

Edit: Since the Original post JR has been linked to the Lakers, so I'll add another BONUS:

**BONUS: Kyle Korver, 38 years old, UFA, Utah Jazz**

The Grizzlies are probably buying him out at some point, and even though he had a really bad playoff series against the Rockets he can still shoot the hell of the ball and log in about 12-15 minutes for a team in the playoffs in some series. I might like him with the Warriors off ball movement. I'd like him on Minnesota as well.

&amp;nbsp;

#Just give him another shot

**KCP, 26 years old, UFA, LA Lakers**

Buy low. KCP it's in the [top 15 players who underperformed relatively to 2017-18.
](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l6PWeds4w99_z1aQ5sxrwwjyTST_-esvRbQxAQHbsyE/edit#gid=599975154)

He's actually my no.1 guy here. He ended last season on the right note, a good focused season out of the holophotes might give you back that tenacious defender with an ok 3 point shot (that actually looks better than it is). He played himself into the taxpayer/room-MLE, and there's talks about the Lakers bringing him back with it, but I'd try to get him locked under a 4 year cheap contract really bad. If I could get him for close 4/40 million honestly I'd do it, but 4/32 would be an excellent investment. 


*My prediction: 4-8 million, but in a short contract most realistically*

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
#Targeting Small Forwards
---

First I'd like to say that this's a really weak mid-tier and low-tier class for Small Forwards. It was really hard to find the right guys, and I don't even feel that strongly about some of them. 

Players I'd like to talk a bit about it:

**Trevor Ariza** is a good player, but considering he has a really strong name in terms being a long time veteran and a known name in a really week mid-tier small forward class, I think he'll get a good contract and considering what he did last year, might be even a slight overpay. That's why he didn't maek the list.

**Rudy Gay** is also a good possibility here, but the Spurs have his early bird rights (They could pay him up to 17.5 million) and could pretty much match any offer (they aren't close to the tax), so I don't see many reasons for him to leave there. 

&amp;nbsp;

#Under the radar Free Agents

*Player name, age on day 1 next season, type of FA, team he lastly played for

**Justin Holiday, 30 years old, UFA, Memphis Grizzlies**

When you're looking for bargains you should players who for some reason had a worst than expected year, and look for the reason he might regress to the player he once was. [Justin Holiday was PIPM's no.1 negative change guy last year](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l6PWeds4w99_z1aQ5sxrwwjyTST_-esvRbQxAQHbsyE/edit#gid=599975154). He was just really bad at both the Bulls and a let down at the Grizzlies. If he fits right with your team go for it, he'd be good playing for the Rockets.

*My prediction: 5-8 million*

**James Ennis, 29 years old, UFA, Philadelphis 76ers**

Ennis shows how important is to have a guy that can play in the playoffs. If it was up to Korkmaz or McConnell the 76ers just wouldn't have taken the Raptors to 7. 3&amp;D guy that could've even helped the Rockets if they didn't trade him. Ennis would be pretty good in a LeBron team, honestly I'd start him and bring Kuzma off the bench.

*My prediction: 4-6 million*


#Minimum players: best fill-out roster options

**Darius Miller, 29 years old, UFA, New Orleans Pelicans**

3 point and no D, Darius Miller is an ok guy to bring out of the bench, and you know what you're getting with him.  His minutes flutuated a lot last year due to injuries, but he was playable in the 2017-18 playoffs. Something to think about is that Miller was Anthony Davis teammate both in College and in New Orleans, but honestly I think he'd fit better with a team like the Nuggets and the Warriors.

**Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, 24 years old, UFA, Brooklyn Nets**

Nets aren't bringing him back, but he's still a young wing that can defend and it's a super versatile guy, played some small ball 5 in the playoffs and honestly wasn't killed there. That's a good bet any team could do.

I'd think on **Sefolosha**, being 35 years old, he took a big step back last season, and only had about 12 MPG with the Jazz, he might just be too washed out to be a trustable player particularly in the playoffs. **Stanley Johnson** was also an idea but the guy just seems a bit too far from not being an offensive net minus. 

&amp;nbsp;

#Investment: 

**Danuel House, 26 years old, RFA, Houston Rockets**

The Rockets have House's non-bird rights, what means that they can pay him nothing more than the 120% minimum, what means they'd have to use their MLE to really keep him. If Butler's coming, they'd be so pressed next to the appron having to hire like 10 guys to fill out the roster, that they might not match a good salary.

They also might not match it they're still worried about paying the tax. They already have 117 million on 6 players, filling in with 7 minimum guys they'd be on about 129 million, so they're still very close to the tax (132 million). Offer him a long term contract on about 6-7 million and watch Fertitta counting the pennies.

*My prediction: 5-7 million*

#Just give him another chance: 

**Jabari Parker, 24 years old, UFA, Washington Wizards**

I thought that he played badly, but athletically he was alright. Parker can really score and restore his value to a similar level to Kyle Kuzma (who's 4 months young) in the right fit. I'd bet on giving him a long term contract if I'm the Kings, Knicks or the Clippers if I have no where else to spend at. I'd happily give him a 4 years 35 million with about 24 million in guaranteed money

*My prediction: 5-10 million*

#Comments:

I didn't like that post as much, there just isn't a lot of answers here, the mid-tier SF is a big weakness of the market.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

#Targeting Power Forwards

---
The Power Forward is a position where in the playoffs wings that can play small ball 5 are really valuable, so it's a position of high demand, finding players that can be serviceable back-ups in the playoffs for close to the minimum is already a major victory.

2 interesting players I'd like to talk about are **Nikola Mirotic** and **Al Farouq Aminu**, They are good players that might not comeback to their original team but with the strong market of it's position I don't believe they will provide good contract because they still have far too many weakness exploitable in the playoffs to justify a starter level of contract. 

Another interesting player would be **Carmelo Anthony**. Like I said, having a serviceable back-up player for the minimum at the wing is a major win, and I won't pencil Melo as a sure thing as a good back-up 4, but I think he can still make a comeback to play 10-15 minutes on a good team.

#Under the radar Free Agents

*Player name, age on day 1 next season, type of FA, team he lastly played for

**DeMarre Carroll, 33 years old, UFA, Brooklyn Nets**

Carroll is a not so good 3, deteriorated D kind of player, who didn't play well in the last playoffs, but if I don't think it would kill you to give 10-15 minutes for him a game in the playoffs with his hustle and at least teams won't let him open in the corner. That's the kind of impact James Ennis gave to the 76ers and you can see the importance in that, Carroll even gives you a bit better size, experience and some veteran leadership. A team like Sacramento could give him a contract.

*My prediction: 5-9 million/year, maybe 12/2.*

**JaMychal Green, 29 years old, UFA, LA Clippers**

Green was always a favorite of mine, but this year he showed his full potential on the Clippers, particularly in the playoffs ~~with those 5 fouls in 1 quarter agaisnt the Warriors~~ as a small ball 5. Highly versatile, a 4/5 that can hit 3s, JaMychal Green has obvious fit in the modern NBA, and would fit well as a backup 5 in the playoffs with the Lakers.

*My prediction: 4-8 million/year*

**Mike Scott, 31 years old, UFA, Philadelphia**

Scott has had a similar path to Green and has a similar style of play, with similar fit. I'd call him a plan B to Green though.

*My prediction: 4-8 million/year*

**Taj Gibson 34 years old, UFA, Minnesota Timberwolves**

Taj is a bit washed up, but he could be really good as a back-up 4 and playing some small ball 5. He's still a beast at the boards, still plays great D, and still is a very efficient offensive player. He even shot some 3s this year, a skill that would be very interesting for him to expand as he ages.

*My prediction: 5-7 million/year, what about 18/3?*

**Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, 24 years old, UFA, Brooklyn Nets**

The Nets made him a unrestricted FA and that should interest other teams. I don't think RHJ will ever be a 3 point shooter, but he's a great defender, and could fit teams in a specific role as a D specialist, in similar way to Royce O'Neale. He had a great 3rd year, with a TS% of 55%, but than he regressed a lot on year (got less to the line, got to 46.4 TS%). If he can bounce back he's a solid rotation wing, so that's a good bet particularly because I think he'll go basically for free this offseason. 

*My prediction: min-5 million/year, signs a 1 year deal*

&amp;nbsp;

My favorite fits: Carroll - Kings, Green - Lakers or Celtics, Scott - 76ers, Gibson - Hawks, RHJ - Suns

#Not cheap, but might be worth it

**Thaddeus Young, 31 years old, UFA, Indiana Pacers**

Let's start with my no.1 guy in the position: Thaddeus Young. The Pacers reportedly are planing on Playing sabonis at the 4 and won't resign him. I'm very curious to see a more aggresive team that would put Young more at the 5 and encourage him to shoot more, as he already matches agaisnt 5s in most matchups, and could use his post-up game against small ball lineups. When Oladipo was there, Young was lethal in the pick and roll this past season, and I wonder what would he do with a good pairing. Young definitely gives you starter production for a not that big of a price. I really woud like to see him on the Jazz, or even in the Mavs playing aside Porzingis.

*My prediction: 11-15 million/year, maybe 50/4 or 45/3*

#Minimum players: best fill-out roster options

**Jeff Green, 33 years old, UFA, Washington Wizards**

Jeff Green had good size and is still really athletic, he can shoot and is still an iron man, rarely missing games. He was a solid player last year (The advanced numbers confirm that, RPM of -0.83 which is about average for a SF) and is the kind of 3 and D wing that teams really need, I definetely believe he can log in playoff minutes without hurting it's team. Minnesotta could use him to sub for Dario Saric.

**Kenneth Faried, 29 years old, UFA, Houston Rockets**

Faried rejuvenated his career with the Rockets, showing versatility and that he still is that monster of an athlete. His rim-running + vertical  spacing already has some value, his 8/21 in 3 PT shooting don't really gives you a lot of indication, but he being confident enough to shoot it in game might. The advanced numbers showed him as a neutral player (-0.17 RPM, +0.37 PIPM), what's good for back-up. The team certainly would need some adjustments in terms of defense. He should probably re-sign with the Rockets though.

**Luol Deng, 34 years old, UFA, Minnesota Timberwolves**

Deng can't be overused, but he's still a really smart team defender, the ability to get some buckets and to shoot a little bit. He probably can play a feel minutes in the playoffs without killing you in the 4, and that's valuable.


#Investment

**Trey Lyles, 23 years old, RFA, Denver Nuggets**

Lyles played poorbly this last year, particularly on offense, and the Nuggets already will have Millsap + MPJr + Juancho in the 4, so it's a low chance they're re-signing him. Teams should look into Lyles as still a project, who just had a really bad year (particularly with his shooting, he's a career 33.1% 3P shooter, but shot 25.5% last year), who will probably regress this year, and has a lot of ball handling for a big. He could still be a very interesting player on offense and he's already good on D. A team like the Suns could take a chance on him.

Since I've written the original post he was extended the qualifying offer. That makes this situation a bit harder, although I'd probably say a 24 million over 3 years offer would make it unlikely, but I'm not sure anymore that's actually a bargain.

*My prediction: 5 million per year, maybe 15/3 years*

#Just give him another shot

**Markieff Morris, 30 years old, UFA, Indiana Pacers**

Markieff Morris never really looked healthy in OKC. But he looked the better Morris brother his hole career, and I think he's really worth another shot as a 4/small ball 5 for a contender, as a buy low candidate. He can shoot a bit and has wing size, these 2 things already have some value, if he reabilitates physically and mentally he could give you starter production basically for free.

*My prediction: signs for minimum.*

&amp;nbsp;

**The post pretty much ends here.**

&amp;nbsp;

#Bonus: Directly from Europe

**Derrick Williams, Bayern Munich**

Derrick Williams was ok in europe, I just really wanted to let you guys know he's planning a comeback to the NBA, but he doesn't really make it to any of the classes here because I don't think he'll really contribute if he comes back.

**Mindaugas Kuzminskas, 29 years old, UFA, Olimpia Milano**

Kuzmisnkas is a good fill-out roster for the minimum option, and he's also planing a comeback to the league. Good size, athleticism and an ok 3 point shot, I'd take a flyer on him for minimum. What's up Knicks fans!

#Comments:

The Nuggets extending Lyles the qualifying offer surprised me a lot. I still think they won't match an offer for him that puts them close to the tax, specially because they have the extensions of Murray and Beasley incoming and should constraint them over the next years. 

The Power Forward position actually has a good depth, that'd make me optismitic if I'm a team like the Suns, the Jazz or the Warriors and I am in need of one. Thaddeus Young just might be a big steal in this Free Agency.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
#Targeting Centers
---
The Center is a very rich position in terms of players, I have a list of 33 interesting players at the 5 (or players at the 4 that COULD be seen as a 5), excluding players like Gortat and Chandler that are a bit washed out.



Player | Player 2 | Player
------|--------|------
Vucevic | Horford | BroLo
Cousins | Valanciunas| DAJordan
Enes Kanter | WCStein | Young*
Vonleh | Dewayne Dedmon | Bobby Portis
Thomas Bryant | RoLo| Khem Birch
Ed Davis| Maxi Kleber | Taj
JaMychal Green | Faried | Zubac
Marjanovic | Kevon Looney | Holmes
Daniel Theis | Jordan Bell | KOQ
Muscala | McGee | Noah
Cheick Diallo| Salah Mejri| Karminsky

&amp;nbsp;

Considering the conclusion of my last post mocking the 2019 Free Agency, the results of 2018 Free Agency (Hey Nerlens Noel) you'd expect there will be a lot of bargains out there. The Room and Tax MLE will be powerfull, and possibly the BAE (Bi-Annual Exception, at 3.6 million this year).

It might also be a lot of 1 year contracts, considering there are really no advantages in signing back-up centers to long salaries:

* Low trade value of back-up and even low tier starters at the 5, even if at good contracts (See Ivica Zubac)

* Flexibility going forward, possibility to get younger.

* No dead money risk from a injury or massive drop-off.

* There will always be a good center available at the next free agency

* You never know what's the next draft going to be, that roster spot and minutes might have better value next season on a Zach Collins kind of guy.

&amp;nbsp;

**Players I'd like to talk a bit about it:**

I don't quite like **Julius Randle**. He was a 20/10 players last season, but in a real playoff team what does he do? He is a big defense liability, still doesn't quite space the floor. It hurts too much to put him out there, I think he'll be too targetted in a playoff series. Randle's contract might be around 15+ million if the Knicks really strike out at everything else. I wouldn't pay him the MLE in this circumstances. 

**Aaron Baynes:** Baynes might be bought out by the Suns either now or in February, keep an eye for him.

**An interesting contract**: Is the Nerles Noel special. There are a lot of centers that will probably get the minimum. The top tier of these guys like Robin Lopez and possibly Kanter will have some teams competting, and a 1 + 1 at the minimum will be the contract to look out for. That means an player option on year 2, pretty much to give this guy some guarantee on being in the league next year. 


&amp;nbsp;

#Under the radar Free Agents

*Player name, age on day 1 next season, type of FA, team he lastly played for

**Ed Davis, 30 years old, UFA, Brooklyn Nets**

If you don't count the fake reserves like Harrell and Sabonis (they play starting minutes pretty much) Ed Davis was the best back-up center in last year's league. He's a good enough switch guy, rebounding machine, good defensive player, solid pick and roller. And it just doesn't seem the Market has turned that well for him. The Nets are reportedly going after DeAndre Jordan, so that's one less competitor. I'd love him on the 76ers.

*My prediction: 4-8 million*

**Nerlens Noel, 25 years old, UFA, OKC Thunder**

The Thunder are obviously too deep into the tax and they don't have bird rights to re-sign him even if he wasn't. Noel is a low tier-starter in this league IMO. He'd be absolutely great at any team just because of how well of a defender he's, but I'd really like him in the Celtics if they sign Kemba and end up without a starting Center. The Lakers would be good in terms of opportunity for him, or a team that miss out on a bigger center, like possibly the New Orleans Pelicans.
 
*My prediction: 4-6 million*

**Khem Birch, 27 years old, RFA, Orlando Magic**

This is more of a situational one, if the Magic actually re-sign Vucevic and T-Ross, they will be too close to the tax to re-sign him. Khem Birch was one of the best back-up centers in the league last year. If the Magic aren't willing to re-sign him, he could be in the room-MLE - taxpayer MLE level.

*My prediction: 4-8 million*

#Not Cheap might be worth it

Brook Lopez. But wait a minute, I think I have a better one: Not spending top dollars in the Center position. Honestly you can get production for so cheap that I rather just take the Warriors route.

**The Warriors route, 2015-19, Bogut/Zaza/Looney/Bell/Jones/Cousins**

Filling out your roster with 3 or 4 centers with them having different playstyles, so you can adequate it to your matchup.

Some suggestions: 

1. KOQ, Noel, JaMyChal Green

2. WCStein, Karmisnky, Bell

3. Davis, McGee, Theis, Noah

Just a thought, mix it up a slower great defensive center (Bogut), a switching guy (Looney/Bell) and a floor spacer (Cousins).

#Minimum players: best fill-out roster options

**Robin Lopez, 31 years old, UFA, Chicago Bulls**

He's 31 years old and 2 months. what's actually younger than I though he was. He's pretty much the definition of solid in the center position. Great block out guy, makes your team rebound better, good pick and roll, smart defender. And he's really stable, being pretty much a sure thing.

**Richaun Holmes, 26 years old, UFA, Phoenix Suns**

Holmes played really well this year, I love Ayton and his potential, but many times the Suns looked better with Holmes at the 5. He's still kind of young, last year he really simplified things: Stopped shooting 3s and just did the things he does best, rebounding, blocking shots, going strong in the pick and roll.

**Taj Gibson, 34 years old, UFA, Minnesota Timberwolves**

Honestly it's a bit more unrealistic for him to only get the minimum, I think the BAE or room MLE might be just as likely, but he would be such a great piece for the playoffs, he's still a great defender and rebounder, really smart and efficient guy that fits really well a team that actually wants to contend. When you're playing the finals, there's only about 2 or 3 bench guys that can actually play without killing you, if you get one of them for the minimum you're good. 

&gt;But he will  surely get the room MLE or part of the tax from someone

He earned 70 million dollars over his career (so that considerable money) though and he's 10 year veteran, so his minimum is $2,561,463, making the BAE not so lucrative and he could get a 1+1 worth 5.25 million, what's close in terms of guarantee money even to a team that gives him the full tax MLE. And maybe for that difference he just decides to play for the minimum for a team that offers a better option. I'd actually really like him on the Warriors.

&amp;nbsp;

#Investment

**Jordan Bell, 24 years old, RFA, GSWarriors**

The Warriors are reportedly really high on Damian Jones, so I don't expect them to bring Bell back on a long term contract, specially considering Green's salary in 2020 and that they've addded Smailagic who'll end up overlapping a bit with Bell.

Bell didn't play very well last year, but he had a great rookie season, a really smart player with some size issues, could be an useful piece on the playoffs more than in the regular season.

*My prediction: A 3 years BAE might be enough here (11.3 million - 3 years)

PS: **Why not Thomas Bryant**? Someone will probably think: The Wizards have to re-sign Ariza (at least they hope to), Jabari Parker, Bobby Portis (who they've traded for) and Satoransky (they don't have another PG on the books). They just might be in the tax when it's time for their last signing of these 5 players. And that could mean the player could easily walk. But I don't think they would simply give away Thomas Bryant for the BAE or something. If that was the case they would simply match it and them trade some of these players for value during the season. Ariza will probably be really tradeable close to the playoffs. I think it would've to be a 7+ million dollars offer per year to actually steal him from the Wizards. Bryant is 21 years old, but he's more of a back-up center right now, and I think a 24 million contract for him would be more of a fair offer than a bargain. Specially considering the down side of signing centers for multiple year that I've specified here.

#Just give him another shot

**Kenneth Faried, 29 years old, UFA, Houston Rockets**

Faried showed some range this past year, but he's really worth for bringing to the table offensive rebounding, switching ability and vertical spacing in the pick and roll. That's for a player that I honetly think will get the minimum or a 1+1 min. 

#Comments:

I really want to say here that Joakim Noah looked quite well on the Grizzlies and would also be a good pick-up as a minimum guy.

Some people had a problem with my Faried inclusion as a 5, but I'd stand by it that he could play the 5 with the right 4 besides him. A lot of people are excited about Noel what makes me think if I might not be undervaluing his market.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,53594,public,self,"[OC] Finding Bargains in 2019 Free Agency - Targeting ""x"" Superpost",0,1561926235,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/c744ki/oc_finding_bargains_in_2019_free_agency_targeting/,,,,,,,,,,,,

This Top 100 list is purely based off of statistics, but not in the basic points-rebounds-assists style that many people come to think of when they hear the word statistics. I created a metric called Value Above Replacement Modern, or VARM. This is similar to Win Shares, Box Plus Minus and PER in the sense that it takes a player and summarizes their impact with a single number. VARM values scoring volume and efficiency, passing volume and passing efficiency, offensive and defensive rebounding, adjusted defensive metrics, team success, pace, and era. VARM is calculated for each player during each regular season they played. VARM is also calculated for each playoffs that each players played in. VARM is fairly significantly adjusted for era, as I believe that players playing at an all-star level in today league are far superior that players playing at an all-star level in the 50s and 60s.

The second half of my all time ranking list comes from a second formula called Career Composite, or CC. CC is calculated using Peak VARM, Average VARM over a players top ten seasons and Total VARM, each for both regular season and playoffs. MVPs and All-Star appearances mean nothing. However, being an MVP, Playoff MVP, or All-Star according to VARM does affect a players CC. Also, this is an NBA list, so ABA, oversees, high school, and college play as no weight.

Career Composite is what I sort by to get this Top 100 list.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,53574,public,self,The Top 100 NBA Players of All Time,0,1561916140,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/c725qk/the_top_100_nba_players_of_all_time/,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hello /r/nbadiscussion!

The goal of this subreddit is to create a space to have high quality NBA discussion – free from memes, shitposts, fanbase attacks and unsubstantiated claims. The subreddit rules are fairly concise, and we as moderators have been pretty lax on them thus far. Initially, this wasn’t an issue. Most who came fully bought into what we were trying to do. This meant that a more live-and-let-be stance was sufficient to facilitate activity. As this subreddit has grown, the quality of posts has dropped even though the absolute number of posts that generate good discussion has remained fairly steady. Even so, the relatively small size of this community means that even posts that have been downvoted a few times because of its content end up on the front page (when browsing by Hot). It also means that browsing by new is a slog for visitors, both new and returning.

I have personally noticed the subreddit returning to relative normalcy since the hype generated by the playoffs has ebbed. However, in the wake of of that experience, we are instituting new, more concrete requests of all of you that will, with your help, make for more coherent and productive conversations moving forward. You’ll notice that the rules on the sidebar will also update to reflect these following changes.

-------------------

###### Character minimum on submissions.

Too many posts are composed of a simple title and a single sentence. How can you introduce your arguments, provide context, and discuss your stance on the argument with such little real estate? This should reduce the number of quick, knee-jerk posts that had proliferated in the subreddit. On the topic of titles…

###### We will require high-quality titles.

Posts are defined by their titles. Having an ill-defined or gimmicky title does not help prime the reader for a productive conversation. Emojis in titles will result in the post being removed.

###### For questions (as opposed to OC, statistical analyses, news, or similar), OP will ideally provide their own perspective/answer first.

Please at least explain where you coming from, even if it is in a topic that you know very little about. Then, commenters know where to start and how to approach a response. If the question is a matter of opinion, the foundation of argument is that there a position available to be attacked/defended.

Additionally, if post is meant to report news, please provide a link to the source in the body of your post. Please do not make unsubstantiated claims.

----------------

A less concrete change is that the mods will more actively remove those posts that violate these rules. If the violation is fairly minimal and the fix is fairly easy, you are encouraged to re-submit! As always, please report any post or comment you feel violates the rules of this subreddit.

----------------

Please contact us with any concerns, questions, or comments. In addition to all these changes, the mod team would like to announce that we are open to adding some mods for the upcoming season. Please send a message in [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fnbadiscussion) if you are interested. Thanks!

• Replace Preseason with a tourney, single elimination, winners get cash.

• Change the # of games to 65-68 range.
   - You play each team twice at the minimum,   and you may play them a 3rd time if it's a primetime matchup. For example POR vs. OKC may happen 3 times instead of 2 times due to it being a marketable game.

• Have 2 breaks during the season for separate tourneys, similar to European soccer. 
 
• Remove conferences.

• Top 14 teams are automatically in the playoff bracket at the end of the season. 
     - 15th-18th ranked teams will play each other in 3 games over the course of a week. Top 2 teams in the group get 15th and 16th spot (point differential decides tiebreakers).

• No changes to actual playoffs other than seeding.

• #1 pick will be decided by an elimination tourney, with the top 2 worst teams getting 1st round byes. 1 game elimation tourney, winner gets the #1 pick. Picks 2-5 are the lottery while the rest is determined by team record.

• Remove financial restrictions based on awards. All players max contract cap will be the same, and the max will be decided by the league on a year by year basis. 

• Allow teams to sign contracts up to 6 years if they have a players Bird Rights.

• Sidenote: whats the point of early bird rights, so useless

• Saw this on a Reddit post, but it would be cool to get the worlds best international Basketball clubs and put them in a tournament with some of the smaller markets/bottom teams.

That being said, his retirement seems a lot more like an anomaly than a trend.

**Intro**

*(Skip to the section titled* ***Top 40 Ranks*** *if you just want to see my list of title teams without explanation)*

I wanted to objectively rank all 73 NBA title teams in order of their dominance on the league for their year. I consulted four team stats evenly:

* Regular Season Win Percentage
* Playoff Win Percentage
* Regular Season Point Differential
* Playoff Point Differential

I chose these statistics because I believe they are objectively linked with the meaning of ""dominance"".

I compared these stats of each title team to the averages of all the title teams. The following rankings of these teams are bases solely off of these relative statistical standings.

**Possible Biases**

* Parity &amp; Quality Opponent Scrutiny \- teams who played in deeper leagues and faced tougher playoff opponents are short-changed here.
* Changes in Season Length and Playoff Brackets \- the length of regular season schedules and format of playoff brackets have changed several times since 1947. I suspect short seasons and playoffs are favored here.
* The Data I Chose to Observe and the Choice to Weigh them Evenly \- some might consider the regular season or playoffs more important. Some might consider playoff loses less relevant. Some might not care about point differential. Some might care about a stat I did not observe.

**Top 40 Ranks**

40. 2005 San Antonio Spurs

39. 2012 Miami Heat

38. 1980 Los Angeles Lakers

37. 2000 Los Angeles Lakers

36. 1981 Boston Celtics

35. 2002 Los Angeles Lakers

34. 1960 Boston Celtics

33. 1990 Detroit Pistons

32. 1982 Los Angeles Lakers

31. 1959 Boston Celtics

30. 1993 Chicago Bulls

22. 2018 Golden State Warriors

21. 1964 Boston Celtics

**20. 2014 San Antonio Spurs**

* Regular Season Record (%): 62-20 (*0.756*)
* Playoff Record (%): 16-7 (*0.696*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *7.8*
* Playoff Point Differential: *9.3*

\-Even in 2014, San Antonio had good numbers. They took more playoff losses than some but were above-average in every other category.

\-

**19. 1949 Minneapolis Lakers**

* Regular Season Record (%): 44-16 (*0.733*)
* Playoff Record (%): 8-2 (*0.800*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *7.3*
* Playoff Point Differential: *7.4*

\-Time for some Mikan love. The season and playoff bracket may have been short but these champs clocked in solid win percentages and differential overall.

\-

**18. 1992 Chicago Bulls**

* Regular Season Record (%): 67-15 (*0.817*)
* Playoff Record (%): 15-7 (*0.682*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *10.4*
* Playoff Point Differential: *6.2*

\-Chicago's fourth highest ranking champs had an impressive regular season but a more difficult path in the playoffs.

\-

**17. 1961 Boston Celtics**

* Regular Season Record (%): 57-22 (*0.722*)
* Playoff Record (%): 8-2 (*0.800*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *5.6*
* Playoff Point Differential: *11.6*

\-Russell's highest ranking and Boston's second highest title season lands here for inverse reasons of the previous team: Bland regular season and an impressive playoff run.

\-

**16. 1989 Detroit Pistons**

* Regular Season Record (%): 63-19 (*0.768*)
* Playoff Record (%): 15-2 (*0.882*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *5.8*
* Playoff Point Differential: *7.7*

\-While each category is solid, Isiah's squad nearly hits the top 15 mainly because of the their impressive playoff record (which included 3 sweeps).

\-

**15. 1985 Los Angeles Lakers**

* Regular Season Record (%): 62-20 (*0.756*)
* Playoff Record (%): 15-4 (*0.789*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *7.3*
* Playoff Point Differential: *10.1*

\-While this is Magic Johnson's second highest ranking title team, this is Kareem's third highest title squad. Oddly, while this team lost more games in both the regular season and the playoffs, these Lakers had better differentials than the '89 Pistons (ranked 16th).

\-

**14. 1999 San Antonio Spurs**

* Regular Season Record (%): 37-13 (*0.740*)
* Playoff Record (%): 15-2 (*0.882*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *8.1*
* Playoff Point Differential: *7.2*

\-This iteration of the Spurs may get overlooked because of the shortened regular season but they won at a high rate with strong margins. The highest ranking Spurs swept a young Kobe/Shaq squad and only caught two total playoff losses.

\-

**13. 2001 Los Angeles Lakers**

* Regular Season Record (%): 56-26 (*0.683*)
* Playoff Record (%): 15-1 (*0.938*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *3.4*
* Playoff Point Differential: *12.8*

\-Speak of the devil, here we have the highest ranking appearance of Kobe or Shaq specifically because of their playoff run (which is arguably the second best of all time). Losing only one game and winning by more than a dozen a game is true dominance.

\-

**12. 1950 Minneapolis Lakers**

* Regular Season Record (%): 51-17 (*0.750*)
* Playoff Record (%): 11-2 (*0.846*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *8.4*
* Playoff Point Differential: *9.1*

\-Another Mikan surprise. The seasons and playoffs were more compact so that might be skewing the data but this title team won an consistently strong amount of games at with strong margins. Our final kudos to the original beast of the NBA.

\-

**11. 1972 Los Angeles Lakers**

* Regular Season Record (%): 69-13 (*0.841*)
* Playoff Record (%): 12-3 (*0.800*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *12.3*
* Playoff Point Differential: *3.2*

\-Here's a stacked team for you: Riley, Goodrich, West and Chamberlain. Unfortunately, they only had Elgin Baylor for nine regular season games. The only category dragging these champs down is their unusually low playoff point differential which is probably a result of their [series against the Milwaukee Bucks where the Lakers won despite a negative point differential](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/1972-nba-western-conference-finals-bucks-vs-lakers.html).

\-

**10. 2015 Golden State Warriors**

* Regular Season Record (%): 67-15 (*0.817*)
* Playoff Record (%): 16-5 (*0.762*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *10.1*
* Playoff Point Differential: *7.8*

\-Perhaps the most controversial ranking here, Curry's first title is top ten mainly because of this squad's dominate regular season. Winning over eighty percent by more than ten a game is significant enough to elevate them here.

\-

**9. 1997 Chicago Bulls**

* Regular Season Record (%): 69-13 (*0.841*)
* Playoff Record (%): 15-4 (*0.789*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *10.8*
* Playoff Point Differential: *5.5*

\-This edition of Jordan's Bulls has a similar resume as the previous team list: an elite regular season with a checkered playoff run. The slightly more impressive regular season is the edge here.

\-

**8. 1967 Philadelphia 76ers**

* Regular Season Record (%): 68-13 (*0.840*)
* Playoff Record (%): 11-4 (*0.733*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *9.4*
* Playoff Point Differential: *9.4*

\-Possibly to the chagrin of Celtic fans, Wilt's only victory over Russell is the highest ranking title team for either player because of the dominate regular season and good differentials. Other contributors to this team where Hal Greer, Chet Walker, and Billy Cunningham.

\-

**7. 1983 Philadelphia 76ers**

* Regular Season Record (%): 65-17 (*0.793*)
* Playoff Record (%): 12-1 (*0.923*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *7.7*
* Playoff Point Differential: 6*.5*

\-Here we have our Moses Malone and Julius Erving moment. This championship team has strong numbers but what really stands out is the 12-1 playoff run. All-time, there are only three title teams to only lose one game in the playoffs.

\-

**6. 1991 Chicago Bulls**

* Regular Season Record (%): 61-21 (*0.744*)
* Playoff Record (%): 15-2 (*0.882*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *9.0*
* Playoff Point Differential: *11.7*

\-The top choice of Jordan's original trilogy, '91's run sticks out for its elite playoff run. Beating Ewing, Barkley, Isiah Thomas and Magic Johnson in four consecutive series is amazing. Taking only two loses along the way with a margin of nearly a dozen points per game is iconic.

\-

**5. 1986 Boston Celtics**

* Regular Season Record (%): 67-15 (*0.817*)
* Playoff Record (%): 15-3 (*0.833*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *9.4*
* Playoff Point Differential: *10.3*

\-Larry Bird &amp; Co.'s highest ranking title team starts off the top five because of a very strong regular season and playoff run. With names like Carlisle, Ainge, Walton, Parish, and McHale on the roster, it is no wonder this team was so statistically consistent.

\-

**4. 1987 Los Angeles Lakers**

* Regular Season Record (%): 65-17 (*0.793*)
* Playoff Record (%): 15-3 (*0.833*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *9.3*
* Playoff Point Differential: *11.4*

\-The height of Showtime, it really is remarkable just how similar these numbers are to the previously ranked team's. Trading two less regular season wins for a point more in the playoff win margin is the statistical edge apparently (but the margin is razor thin). Either way, shout out to Scott, Worthy, Riley, and, of course, Magic and Kareem.

\-

**3. 1996 Chicago Bulls**

* Regular Season Record (%): 72-10 (*0.878*)
* Playoff Record (%): 15-3 (*0.833*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *12.3*
* Playoff Point Differential: *10.6*

\-Likely the biggest shock of these rankings is seeing this team ranked only third. The top ranking team for Phil Jackson, Pippen &amp; Michael Jordan and the greatest regular season of all title teams is surprisingly outdone here because their playoff run was slightly less dominate.

\-

**2. 1971 Milwaukee Bucks**

* Regular Season Record (%): 66-16 (*0.805*)
* Playoff Record (%): 12-2 (*0.857*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *12.2*
* Playoff Point Differential: *14.5*

\-Milwaukee and Oscar Robertson's only and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's first title run is unique for having the best playoff point differential here. All the other stats are quite impressive as well so, while it may be an obscure choice, the 1971 Milwaukee Bucks have a strong claim to the most dominate season ever.

\-

**1. 2017 Golden State Warriors**

* Regular Season Record (%): 67-15 (*0.817*)
* Playoff Record (%): 16-1 (*0.941*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *11.6*
* Playoff Point Differential: *13.5*

\-Millennials rejoice, the first Curry/Durant Warriors' title run tops my statistical dominance rankings because they paired an elite regular season with the greatest playoff run of all time. Sporting the best playoff record and second best point differential ever ultimately trumps this list.

That one would call into question who is in control, Lebron or Magic Johnson. Now we see why Kylie Irving has lost his mind... it goes that deep... KD better stay put it’s for his own good. It’s a shame how u got hurt and it makes sense what you and kyrie were up to out east. You were trying to counter what was destined to be the greatest pick up team of all time because you knew something special. Something Lebron told you years ago about CP3... man this what the world gets when the warriors had the audacity to beat him once... skip Bayless may die. I’m convinced sterling sharpe was a plant by Lebron to troll skip the rest of his life... but back to CP3... he’s gonna get paid while making sure no James is ever greater than me the Lebron James... Just wait folks... pretty soon the situation in Houston will be unthinkable and cp3 will be cut by Houston yet paid in full... only to have him suit up on the lakers days later on a “minimum” contract. Daryl Morey thought he mastered the cap only to have CP3 show him whose in charge of the money... you pay me me while I beat you. It’s that deep folks and it’s the ultimate fuck you to David stern years ago denying CP3 his right to be a laker. At that moment, the players decided they would play where they wanted when they wanted and for who they wanted and you could pay them this or that legally under your rules you guys thought up. But we’re still going to find a way to have our team how we want it. This goes back to picking teams growing up trying to figure out the best way to stay on the court. Eat or be eaten... the warriors “were in a different universe” oh that’s cute execs who will never be players... Repeat Lebron Kawhi Anthony Davis melo wade cp3 by mid year... bosh hopefully back able to play. The dream team come alive. Magic Johnson and Lebron James letting klay and steph know their time is up... and letting KD Russ and Harden know if they got out of their own way years ago they could beat Lebron to the punch. Never let people who don’t play the game you play determine when where and how you can play together. Screw it... if Magic Johnson can beat aids then it’s time he debate trump and just become president and everyone can go to sleep... but here’s how you know it’s Lebron. It’s the Shannon Sharpe spy. Skip bayless thought he could make a name for him off your likeness Lebron, Lebron paid it cool, make your millions bro but soon I’m going to make you realize it was never about you and your little opinions on “clutch” and all it’s meaningless diatribes you place on it. Someone who could never 1.4 or is it 1.8... ever truly have their say in it huh? So here’s Shannon sharpe touting all the things you hate with you thinking your the draw attraction. Now live with this same carnival barker you brought on who you thought would be a weaker Stephen A smith... you know someone you needed to fit your “demographic” only to have him as a Lebron plant ready to shove in your face this team... made up of everyone you hate and swear will never be MJ... winning every year for the next 4-5-6 years with you forcing to acknowledge their greatness because these again are the rules you set up bayless. But it goes back to a harsh truth Lebron wanted you to remember. It’s about the players not the ones who think they can play but the actual ones who can play. Sit back and enjoy and be thankful for the scraps.... this was all Lebron folks to more I think about it. Poor lavar wanted so bad to be part of it but you can’t trust a selfish guy... someone else who couldn’t play and is in denial of his athletic history... much like skip... but he couldn’t call back to his true nature so trying to throw Lonzo a free ring wasn’t in the cards. Maybe it was Lebron annoyed at the cute notion that a guy who couldn’t play force feeding the public his sons screaming they were meant to rule the league while Lebron looking at his loins knowning what he gave birth to... I said it goes that deep so keep listening. Welcome to a future where Lebron Jr. becomes the first rookie since you guessed it “magic” to win the title. That’s what real dads do isn’t it Lebron. Set their sons up for success, something Lebron never had the luxury of having and he was hell bent to make sure his kids got in return. Wow this better be true this where is we call into question the nature of reality... KD may not be as hurt as advertised. Lebron could look in the mirror at KD and say good looking young fella you beat me to the punch and I’m honest enough to say you and I might be tops in the world... that’s left to be seen.  But first take a dive, give kawhi his ring so he needs the validation he needs to get magic to close the deal on him so you and I can finally have it... in New York vs LA center of the universe of the world we like to call America. Somewhere Obama is laughing... poor Boston left out and left to deal with the trump, white guy, skip Bayless narratives it’s not your fault you sold your soul for football glory.... but there are white guys from that area we do love like bill Simmons, true philosophers who truly wish to see time and time again the great questioned be answered... who is truly is the greatest of all time. So now here we are folks. Screw “rules” “money”  “thoughts” or anything like that just be glad Stephen a Smith you get to see this... oh Shannon you’re gonna be living life and here’s why. Lebron vs KD super teams surrounded in the greatest pick up game of all time. Welcome to the NBA... you think that’s air you’re breathing neo? Lebron is ready to propose the greatest question of all time. Who is the greatest? Who can break the constructs of time? Skip Bayless and those types don’t matter. Poor Lavar better luck next time with giving birth...Who wants in on this 5 v 5 game??? You know the one one where it’s gonna be 6-7-8... part of me hopes MJ pays the Supermax for Kemba only to have Kemba being unable to repair the working relationship with Charlotte... Jordan paying Kemba to compete for New York while he’s on a minimum. So do we really need to have the Jordan vs Lebron debate now? Damn Lebron you’ve been working the phones this is too much fun. Props to pelinka playing the bumbling white dude with no clue... making the other bumbling white fools who can’t play think they have a thought.... realize he was just playing the caricature of them. Oh that cuts deep wow... because it’s true. This is wild folks and may be the final nail in the coffin we know as reality. Remember that sweep after game one loss? Turns out magic wasn’t over that loss MJ. So go ahead and buy “Charlotte” oh that’s cute. I’ll be hear in Los Angeles repping my squad til the day I die. That’s where you messed up MJ. You believed David stern by letting him suspend you two years bro? Really to play a white mans game? Baseball? I would’ve tipped the cap to you MJ but you walked away from what was ours all along and you chose to believe was theirs.... with their rules and such you know...you didn’t stay loyal to Chicago. Or maybe they didn’t stay loyal to you only time will tell that tale but magic knew it was up to him in that moment... to make sure the greatest players are always allowed to play a game their the best at... on their terms. Lebron was the chosen disciple... the true triple double son who understood the game in its purest form, yin and yang the basket and ball a side note in this sacred dance of men.... black men too who since we’ve known have been trying to be held down and captive. Magic Johnson y’all, Lebron y’all, Obama y’all.... shit president about to be coach isn’t he? And maybe that’s what it’s about about and why we had to deal with trump in the short term... with great prayer comes sacred joy. Remember the David stern, the trumps, the skips who hate, have long not wanted this game to happen, you know the game where men are allowed to be free in motion and energy removed from the rules you wished so desperately to create. Damn folks Lebron about to have coach Obama and the super team come to life versus KD and whoever he wants. Whose looking away? Not you not me... and that’s the magic of “magic” Johnson. Shit makes me think they have the man aids to stop this.... the grand philosopher of our time who figured it on a court the majesty of humans of any color able to freely do whatever they want to do however they want to do it whenever they want to do it.... and your gonna pay em too😎 oceans eleven the remix movie too good to be true. Shit Lebron taking on Hollywood... content for years fellas soak it in... space jam 2 was just scraps😂😂😂 Lebron and Magic didn’t like how MJ again got tricked... he sold himself short on that flick. Only leveraged it to get “Charlotte” you know slave country folk as a franchise... small beans versus space jam 2 and the world fellas... Magic Lebron about to finish the job and get the ultimate revenge.... shits running deep here America and maybe the lesson is this. If you’re gonna enslave a people for centuries don’t complain when the “monstars” come out the other end.... space jam 2 about to be a documentary, straight to Netflix.... fuck that brobflix, they probably bought up the rights to “the office” in 2021.... damn this is true isn’t! Kyrie tugged the cape when he had it good... and this is why kyrie has been so desperate to get back into his good graces... to be part of the 5 v 5 game... lesson learned bron, give him to KD we all deserve it. Lebron vs trump bout to be a thing? What’s the running age for president again? Rock as VP? That’s how you get freedom for all. All we have to do is believe and buy in because like it or not folks... reality’s coming.... and that after all is the magic of “tragic” Johnson. Part of me thinks Magic wants to get back to that one on one game. Him vs bird the worthy adversary. This time Boston removed, Charlotte owned and David stern left turning in his open grave... just jump in fool you lost. So go ahead and cling to the NFL with all its rules and structure as the dominant theme and sport we all love America. Oh wait, Lebron and the super lakers about to own the nfl season too. When is opening night again says the 5-1 pats fan? It’s okay it’s nothing personal. But just know... when you force the monstars to make your bank... those receipts will one day be in full. Shit has me thinking.... Lebron and the super fellas filming the docudrama we call space jam 2 for your viewing pleasure. With coach Obama. You think coaches matter? They do but not the coaches who aren’t me and clearly are making bank by convincing me they need them... you know college basketball. Jimmy B knew something that perhaps he’s been avoiding his whole life. Shit if we’re being honest we have been too... by playing zone we’re avoiding what all men need to do at days end. Play man to man let’s look in the mirror. It’s that fact which has prevented communities like blacks and native Americans (me) from accepting the tragedy of the past doesn’t have to define our future. For as man after a fresh look in the mirror we can make sure that doesn’t happen again or to anyone else ever again. “King” James here we go... okay president trump... we figured out reparations for you didn’t we? Space jam 6-7-8 wow and here back in the day I thought coach “k” from ol North Carolina... was the reason these players made the leap when in all reality it was tragic magic... MJ... finally getting these young fellas in the same spot... now school in session. Shit MJ is on this isn’t he? Was this before or after one of your card games you two played back on the “dream” team? Age took ya but it really didn’t did it? Magic wanted to show MJ a secret. You see how you beat me MJ at this card game? Well guess what MJ I beat you... how? That game doesn’t exist, no game exists they created... its our game. No rules. We win. Shit Magic you’re right... let’s get this done. Settle down MJ it’s gonna take time, you gotta knowing something though. When I went out west I met Walton you know that crazy hippie dude and he showed me something... something their afraid for us to see. But it opened my mind to the secret. This game we call basketball is just a game.  But we’re life undefined. But if we play our cards right for the first time the players of the game may get to define the game... oh what a concept... you know the concept of life.

Obviously it’s normal to defend your family in a tense situation. But this was obviously a jab at Draymond, a Warrior’s lifer that would be KD’s teammate if he decided to stay. And the “greatness is done rubbing off and people see you for what you really are comment is damning too”. 


Tony’s IG story caption a day ago, tagging a New York location: “Key to a group of successful Leaders, is they all once were willing followers!”

This is more of a reach, but with his brother’s free agency on the horizon and tagging a New York location, that sounds like a perfect quote to suggest KD wants his own team in New York and is indeed leaving Golden State, where he was a willing follower for three seasons.

If we get Kyrie and KD, it is the most necessary and understandable move to let D lo go. Still Inwouldve been better if KD was healthy. KD literally has an Achilles injury that stats and history says do not favor players at all. People keep saying KD at 75 to 80% will still be great, how sure are we? Yes he doesn’t rely on athletic ability like D Rose or Lebron do, but he still needs that skill.

   It isn’t that his defense can get worse, his driving ability can be weakened, and you can’t just say he can rely on his shooting ability. If he relies on jumpers he can easier to defend. Reports are even saying he can’t play over 30 minutes a game now too. I just don’t think spending 38 million dollars for a guy off an Achilles is that worth it. He isn’t going to be the same player like he once was. It is just math and a very proven one. I understand if we do do get KD but I wouldn’t guarantee us any ring with this signing. It doesn’t make us like GS. I think GS would be wise to keep him because they still have two or three years of good contention with all four players.

I want to outline my idea for a solution, but please respond with suggestions/alterations you may have!

I tried to be as concise as possible, here goes...

1. Shorten regular season to 72 games

2. After the 50 or 60 game mark, take a two week break for the new “International Tournaments”

3. There will be three separate International Tournaments, each played as single elimination with 8 teams in them (so a max of 3 games/team played)

4. Start by determining the 6 teams who will not be invited... these are the 4 teams who played in last year’s conference finals (allows these squads to rest after the shorter offseason they had), and the current worst team in each conference (to prevent teams from tanking too badly)

5. Invite the top four teams from each conference who will most likely be playing in the playoffs to play in a tournament where the prize will be the #15 pick in the upcoming draft (the first round will now have 31 picks, so this will be a free pick is given to a team in addition to their first round pick)

6. Invite the 8 teams remaining in the Eastern conference to a tournament where the prize will be a guaranteed spot in the playoffs (this will allow the victor the opportunity to rest stars for the remaining 20 games with a guaranteed playoff spot as #8 seed OR they can continue to attempt to better their standing)

7. Invite the 8 teams remaining in the Western conference to a tournament where the prize will be a guaranteed spot in the playoffs (same as above)

8. Each of the three 8 team tournaments are played in different cities (one could be played in China, one could be in Australia, and one could be in Europe... these could rotate on basis of where league wants more fandom, the only restriction is each tournament must be in one set location to limit player travel in between games. Hopefully this would generate more fans and $ for the league)

If this had happened last year this would be the outcome...

6 teams not playing: Warriors (WCF), Rockets (WCF), Cavaliers (ECF), Celtics (ECF), Suns (worst team in West), Knicks (worst team in East)

8 teams playing for #15 pick: Nuggets, Blazers, Jazz, Thunder, Bucks, Raptors, 76ers, Pacers

8 teams playing for Eastern playoff spot: Nets, Magic, Pistons, Hornets, Heat, Wizards, Hawks, Bulls

8 teams playing for Western playoff spot: Spurs, Clippers, Kings, Lakers, Wolves, Grizzlies, Pelicans, Mavs

I recently read [Pulling the Goalie](https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=3132563), a sports analytics paper co-written by one of the co-founders of AQR, and it made me think about using similar analysis on something NBA related. I am a Grinnell alum and got the opportunity to experience the Grinnell System for four years, which got me thinking: could an NBA team run The System?  \n\nI did some research and put together a paper that\'s now under review on SSRN: [The Kings of The System](https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=3411392)  \n\nHowever, I know that there are certain nephews in here that don\'t want to read through a full paper, so I thought I\'d provide an abbreviated version here. I am more than happy to discuss the findings and appreciate any and all feedback (unless you decide to be a jerk, in which case I\'ll see you in Temecula).  \n\n***\n\n**What is the Grinnell System?**  \n\nThe Grinnell System (here on out referred to just as ""The System"") is a run-and-gun style of play that emphasizes all-out full-court defense, hockey-style full lineup substitutions every 90-120 seconds, and a ludicrous volume of high value shots, mostly three-pointers and layups. A team implementing The System will push the pace the entire game, attempting to keep the game action constantly in a quasi-transition format. This leads to games that can feature scores close to triple digits by halftime, a near-constant din of excitement from fans, and players smashing personal records on one or both teams. The System resulted in [Jack Taylor\'s historic 138-point game in 2012](https://youtu.be/NHsjK2mQ_Zg), a game where he shot the ball 108 times in 36 minutes, averaging a basket every 42 seconds and a shot every 20 seconds. The System doesn\'t guarantee a win: it aims to provide the team with a higher volume of high-value shot attempts than the opponent through a combination of shot selection, high defensive pressure, and pace-induced fatigue for the opponent. If the shots don\'t fall and/or the opponent prepares properly, The System can be countered. However, the fans still get to see a highly entertaining game of basketball with lots of points, steals, and threes.  \n  \n***\n  \n**The System in the NBA**  \n  \nThe increase in points and pace in the NBA over the past decade has been significant: the 2018-19 Golden State Warriors obliterated the 2006-07 “Seven Seconds or Less” Phoenix Suns both in terms of PPG (117.7 vs. 110.2) and Pace (101.78 vs. 96.49). The contrast is even more stark when comparing those numbers within their respective seasons: while Phoenix was 1st in PPG and 3rd in Pace in 2006-07, Golden State was only 2nd in PPG and *10th* in Pace in 2018-19. The game has gotten faster, and while The System would have been a massive change a decade ago, implementing The System in today\'s NBA would essentially be a transition offense on steroids coupled with a full-court press and a radical substitution strategy. In order to see which team(s) would fit well with The System, I looked at a combination of a quantitative factor model, topline statistics, and qualitative ""fit"" for teams with the playstyle. The model finds four teams in the top tier of System fit, which is then winnowed down by stats and fit. While a few teams could run The System in the NBA, the Sacramento Kings emerge as the front-runners due to favorability across all three aspects.  \n\n***  \n\n**Modeling The System**  \n\nThe paper goes over this in much more detail, so I\'ll just go through the topline structure of the model and its output. I used game data from the 2018-19 NBA season from NBA.com. For the model itself, Coach Arsenault and Grinnell researchers built a formula to quantify The System, resulting in this equation:  \n\n*94 FGA + 47 3PA + 33% OREB.RATE + 32 TOV + (+25 SHOT.DIFF) = 0.95W*  \n\nWhen running The System, getting at least 94 shots, 47 attempted three-pointers, a 33% offensive rebound rate, 32 forced turnovers, and a plus-25 shot differential will result in a win 95% of the time. Granted, this equation is optimized for NCAA Division III men\'s basketball, so in order to transpose it for the NBA data I stripped out the thresholds and swapped win probability for Points.   \n\n*PTS ~ FGA + 3PA + OREB.RATE + TOV + SHOT.DIFF*  \n\nFurthermore, I used some statistical transformations to normalize and vectorize the factors and create a ""System Rank"" factor that distills everything into one factor.  \n\n*PTS ~ β[FGA.RANK; 3PA.RANK; OREB.RANK; TOV.RANK; SHOTDIFF.RANK] + ε = β(sys)*SYS.RANK + ε*  \n\nIt turns out that applying the five factors in this way results in a negative impact of shot differential on points production. This could be due to the vast difference between the NBA and NCAA Division III basketball: there might not be as much of an opportunity for such a large shot differential to occur at the professional level. Conversely, there may not be enough in-sample game data with large Shot Differentials to properly inform this factor. In order to account for this, I ran two different versions of the model; one with shot differential as-is, one with it readjusted to a positive impact *a la* the original Grinnell equation. Here\'s the results from both versions:  \n\n[Unadjusted System Rank](https://i.imgur.com/mUEV7C8.png)  \n\nIn the unadjusted version, ATL is tops, with OKC, MIL, BKN, NOP, and SAC all within a standard deviation.  \n\n[Adjusted System Rank](https://i.imgur.com/T6UslJV.png)  \n\nThe adjusted System Rank sees OKC running away with it at the top spot. SAC is just outside a standard deviation of OKC and leads the second tier of teams, consisting of SAC, ATL, DEN, BOS, MIN, DET, NOP, POR, and HOU.  \n\nAcross both System Ranks, OKC, NOP, ATL, and SAC are the only four teams that show up at or near the top. This makes sense, as all four of these teams were high-scoring and/or high-paced teams during the season. Why not GSW? My reasoning is that GSW excels at both transition and half-court offense; pushing some of these System factors higher would reduce the amount of time in the half-court and could be detrimental to performance. MIL and HOU also seem like candidates, but their (over) reliance on isolation playstyles might be sinking the model\'s opinion of them.  \n\nLet\'s take a look beyond the model for these four teams, and why topline stats and/or narrative work for or against these teams running The System.  \n\n***  \n\n**Oklahoma City Thunder**  \n\nThe big pros for OKC is that they are the best-suited team for The System across both models, and that Russell Westbrook might be the closest thing that the NBA has to a System player. A variation on The System distributes the top two lines in a \'2-6; 1, 7-10\' split, giving Paul George control over the \'2-6\' line with a lot of distribution option and Westbrook control over the \'1, 7-10\' line to allow him to play in his cannonball style and force the other teams to shut him down.  \n\nHowever, there is a massive asymmetric distribution of risk for OKC implementing The System. The amount that The System could improve OKC is outweighed by the larger amount of downside possible if The System harms their performance. Is a potential increase of a couple of seeds in the playoff race worth the risk of dropping out of the playoff picture and squandering the talents of your two All-Stars? As much as I\'d like to see Westbrook average north of 20-20-20 for the season, there\'s just too much downside risk for OKC to implement The System.  \n\n**New Orleans Pelicans**  \n\nNew Orleans is obviously an interesting case here. They are a small-market team that\'s never really sniffed deep playoff success nor had a major footprint of support in the local market. Providing an exciting playstyle like The System could get butts in the seats, but only if the personnel allow for The System to work. They were the second-fastest team in the NBA last season in terms of Pace, but were in the bottom third of the league in terms of %3P and 3PM and were the only team in the league to score over half of their points in the paint.  \n\nHowever, there has been a massive change in the roster since the end of the season, with Anthony Davis on the way out, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, and Josh Hart on the way over from the Lakers, and the Pelicans drafting everyone\'s favorite human tank with a jet engine in Zion Williamson. The trio from the Lakers were part of the fourth-fastest team but the second-worst %3P team in the league last season, fitting it quite comfortably with how the Pelicans played last year. While the 2019-20 Pelicans can push the pace, their poor outside shooting indicates a better fit with running a run-and-gun style that emphasizes stifling defense and getting the ball inside to a bruising frontcourt.  \n\n**Atlanta Hawks**  \n\nThe Hawks have a lot of points in favor of The System and one of the two teams that could probably implement The System next season with minimal adjustments. Atlanta was the highest-paced team in the NBA this season and had were 3rd in 3PA, 4th in 3PM, and 2nd in percentage of points from 3PM (but only 16th in %3P). They were also 10th in percentage of points from fast breaks and 11th in percentage of points off of turnovers, have an ideal scorer/distributor in Trae Young, a couple other All-Rookies in Kevin Huerter and John Collins, and also drafted a few additional incoming rookies that will mesh well with the high pace of their current style.  \n\nIn addition, Atlanta itself is the 9th-largest MSA in the States, but the Hawks were 27th in attendance in 2018-19, basically making them a small-market team. Bringing an exciting style of play might win over some of the notoriously lukewarm-outside-of-football Atlanta sports fans, emphasize the strengths of this young Hawks team, and fast track their growth toward a perennial playoff contender. There\'s really no knock against Atlanta running The System...but there\'s no real motivation for them to want to do it, either. Do I want to see the Hawks run The System and truck a bunch of teams? Absolutely! The real question is: do they?  \n\n**Sacramento Kings**  \n\nThe Kings share a lot of similarities to the Hawks in terms of System fit: young team with major upside, small-market team, a current playstyle that would transition to The System quite well. The Kings had a massive flip in Pace from 2017-18 to 2018-19, going from the slowest team in the NBA to the 3rd fastest. They had the 5th-highest opponent turnover rate, the 4th-lowest turnover rate, the 3rd-highest percentage of points off of turnovers, and the highest percentage of points off of fast breaks. The Kings were also monsters in transition this season: 8th in points-per-transition, 6th in transition scoring frequency, 2nd in total transition possessions, 2nd in transition frequency, 1st in transition FGA, 1st in transition FGM, and the lowest turnover frequency in transition. Sacramento was a team made to play in motion, especially given how much their offense ground to a halt in the half-court (25th in cut, 23rd in isolation, 28th in post up, and 22nd in pick and roll). The Kings also have multiple efficient outside shooters, with five players above 200 3PA last season and four of the five with a %3P above league average.  \n\n[Chart here](https://i.imgur.com/Fgx7lJf.png)  \n\nTwo players in particular are ideal fits for The System. Buddy Hield was on one last season, setting the NBA record for 3PM over a player\'s first three seasons, the 3rd-best %3P in the league, and the 3rd-best %3P in the fourth quarter at an outstanding 43.4%. This amount of volume and efficiency makes Buddy an ideal scorer in The System, especially since it\'ll take a huge drop in efficiency for him to get near to league-average in %3P. If Buddy Hield is a great fit for a System scorer, then De\'Aaron Fox is an ideal System distributor/PG defender. Fox was 13th in assists per game, 12th in steals per game, 4th in percentage of points from fast breaks, and shot 37.1% from beyond the arc. Fox is also [one of the fastest players in the league](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJkrku1a6Ng) and has stated his desire to be an All-NBA defender, making his skillset and motivation very much in line with The System.  \n\nHowever, does The System make sense for the Kings organization? The Kings are nearly two decades removed from their time as championship contenders, haven\'t been in the postseason since 2006, have survived two relocation attempts, and have seen a portion of their MSA footprint conquered by their Bay Area brethren. Despite this, Kings attendance was in the middle third of the league this past season, and fans are getting excited about the young and promising roster. The Kings organization is also no stranger to thinking outside of the box: the trade that brought over Hield was lambasted at the time but is now seen as a fairly shrewd move, and part-owner Vivek Ranadivé has thrown out some...[interesting](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2014/12/29/kings-finally-try-vivek-ranadives-4-on-5-cherry-picking-offense-with-disastrous-results-video/) ideas over the years.  \n\nIn fact, in 2014 the Kings\' D-League affiliate hired a coach specifically experiment with a professionally-unproven playstyle. The hire was Dave Arsenault, Jr., a former Grinnell basketball player and son of Grinnell Coach Arsenault. The playstyle was, of course, The System. The experiment lasted two seasons, with plenty of bumps and adjustments made to The System along the way ([Les Carpenter wrote a great article on that first season](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/feb/20/140-points-a-game-but-are-the-reno-bighorns-a-basketball-experiment-too-far)). The experiment was discontinued after two seasons, but not before the Reno Bighorns posted a Western Conference-best 33-17 record in Coach Dave\'s second season while running a version of The System modified for the D-League. Coach Dave has now taken over for his father as head coach at Grinnell and the Kings\' G-League team runs a typical playstyle, but the Kings are still the only team in the NBA to have at least experimented with The System. Combine that with a roster suited for System success and a market that is ripe for having an exciting team to talk about, and the Kings make for the best-suited NBA team to take on The System.  \n\n***  \n\n**TL;DR for Nephews** The Grinnell System makes the ""Second Seconds or Less"" Suns (a team before your time) look like the 2004 Pistons (another team before your time). Using 2018-19 NBA season data on key factors of ""The System"" in a model, four teams emerge as top candidates for The System (OKC, NOP, ATL, SAC). OKC has too much downside risk taking on The System, NOP has too much personnel flux and questions about outside shooting. ATL has no major cons, but no major pros in favor of The System. SAC has the personnel, the cultural fit, and a past history with The System that make it the front-runner for adopting this style in the NBA.', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey &lt;a href=""/r/nba""&gt;/r/nba&lt;/a&gt;!

In order to account for this, I ran two different versions of the model; one with shot differential as-is, one with it readjusted to a positive impact &lt;em&gt;a la&lt;/em&gt; the original Grinnell equation. Here&amp;#39;s the results from both versions:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/mUEV7C8.png""&gt;Unadjusted System Rank&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the unadjusted version, ATL is tops, with OKC, MIL, BKN, NOP, and SAC all within a standard deviation.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/T6UslJV.png""&gt;Adjusted System Rank&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The adjusted System Rank sees OKC running away with it at the top spot. SAC is just outside a standard deviation of OKC and leads the second tier of teams, consisting of SAC, ATL, DEN, BOS, MIN, DET, NOP, POR, and HOU.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Across both System Ranks, OKC, NOP, ATL, and SAC are the only four teams that show up at or near the top. This makes sense, as all four of these teams were high-scoring and/or high-paced teams during the season. Why not GSW? My reasoning is that GSW excels at both transition and half-court offense; pushing some of these System factors higher would reduce the amount of time in the half-court and could be detrimental to performance. MIL and HOU also seem like candidates, but their (over) reliance on isolation playstyles might be sinking the model&amp;#39;s opinion of them.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s take a look beyond the model for these four teams, and why topline stats and/or narrative work for or against these teams running The System.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oklahoma City Thunder&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The big pros for OKC is that they are the best-suited team for The System across both models, and that Russell Westbrook might be the closest thing that the NBA has to a System player. A variation on The System distributes the top two lines in a &amp;#39;2-6; 1, 7-10&amp;#39; split, giving Paul George control over the &amp;#39;2-6&amp;#39; line with a lot of distribution option and Westbrook control over the &amp;#39;1, 7-10&amp;#39; line to allow him to play in his cannonball style and force the other teams to shut him down.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, there is a massive asymmetric distribution of risk for OKC implementing The System. The amount that The System could improve OKC is outweighed by the larger amount of downside possible if The System harms their performance. Is a potential increase of a couple of seeds in the playoff race worth the risk of dropping out of the playoff picture and squandering the talents of your two All-Stars? As much as I&amp;#39;d like to see Westbrook average north of 20-20-20 for the season, there&amp;#39;s just too much downside risk for OKC to implement The System.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Orleans Pelicans&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;New Orleans is obviously an interesting case here. They are a small-market team that&amp;#39;s never really sniffed deep playoff success nor had a major footprint of support in the local market. Providing an exciting playstyle like The System could get butts in the seats, but only if the personnel allow for The System to work. They were the second-fastest team in the NBA last season in terms of Pace, but were in the bottom third of the league in terms of %3P and 3PM and were the only team in the league to score over half of their points in the paint.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, there has been a massive change in the roster since the end of the season, with Anthony Davis on the way out, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, and Josh Hart on the way over from the Lakers, and the Pelicans drafting everyone&amp;#39;s favorite human tank with a jet engine in Zion Williamson. The trio from the Lakers were part of the fourth-fastest team but the second-worst %3P team in the league last season, fitting it quite comfortably with how the Pelicans played last year. While the 2019-20 Pelicans can push the pace, their poor outside shooting indicates a better fit with running a run-and-gun style that emphasizes stifling defense and getting the ball inside to a bruising frontcourt.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atlanta Hawks&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Hawks have a lot of points in favor of The System and one of the two teams that could probably implement The System next season with minimal adjustments. Atlanta was the highest-paced team in the NBA this season and had were 3rd in 3PA, 4th in 3PM, and 2nd in percentage of points from 3PM (but only 16th in %3P). They were also 10th in percentage of points from fast breaks and 11th in percentage of points off of turnovers, have an ideal scorer/distributor in Trae Young, a couple other All-Rookies in Kevin Huerter and John Collins, and also drafted a few additional incoming rookies that will mesh well with the high pace of their current style.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition, Atlanta itself is the 9th-largest MSA in the States, but the Hawks were 27th in attendance in 2018-19, basically making them a small-market team. Bringing an exciting style of play might win over some of the notoriously lukewarm-outside-of-football Atlanta sports fans, emphasize the strengths of this young Hawks team, and fast track their growth toward a perennial playoff contender. There&amp;#39;s really no knock against Atlanta running The System...but there&amp;#39;s no real motivation for them to want to do it, either. Do I want to see the Hawks run The System and truck a bunch of teams? Absolutely! The real question is: do they?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sacramento Kings&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Kings share a lot of similarities to the Hawks in terms of System fit: young team with major upside, small-market team, a current playstyle that would transition to The System quite well. The Kings had a massive flip in Pace from 2017-18 to 2018-19, going from the slowest team in the NBA to the 3rd fastest. They had the 5th-highest opponent turnover rate, the 4th-lowest turnover rate, the 3rd-highest percentage of points off of turnovers, and the highest percentage of points off of fast breaks. The Kings were also monsters in transition this season: 8th in points-per-transition, 6th in transition scoring frequency, 2nd in total transition possessions, 2nd in transition frequency, 1st in transition FGA, 1st in transition FGM, and the lowest turnover frequency in transition. Sacramento was a team made to play in motion, especially given how much their offense ground to a halt in the half-court (25th in cut, 23rd in isolation, 28th in post up, and 22nd in pick and roll). The Kings also have multiple efficient outside shooters, with five players above 200 3PA last season and four of the five with a %3P above league average.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/Fgx7lJf.png""&gt;Chart here&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two players in particular are ideal fits for The System. Buddy Hield was on one last season, setting the NBA record for 3PM over a player&amp;#39;s first three seasons, the 3rd-best %3P in the league, and the 3rd-best %3P in the fourth quarter at an outstanding 43.4%. This amount of volume and efficiency makes Buddy an ideal scorer in The System, especially since it&amp;#39;ll take a huge drop in efficiency for him to get near to league-average in %3P. If Buddy Hield is a great fit for a System scorer, then De&amp;#39;Aaron Fox is an ideal System distributor/PG defender. Fox was 13th in assists per game, 12th in steals per game, 4th in percentage of points from fast breaks, and shot 37.1% from beyond the arc. Fox is also &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJkrku1a6Ng""&gt;one of the fastest players in the league&lt;/a&gt; and has stated his desire to be an All-NBA defender, making his skillset and motivation very much in line with The System.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, does The System make sense for the Kings organization? The Kings are nearly two decades removed from their time as championship contenders, haven&amp;#39;t been in the postseason since 2006, have survived two relocation attempts, and have seen a portion of their MSA footprint conquered by their Bay Area brethren. Despite this, Kings attendance was in the middle third of the league this past season, and fans are getting excited about the young and promising roster. The Kings organization is also no stranger to thinking outside of the box: the trade that brought over Hield was lambasted at the time but is now seen as a fairly shrewd move, and part-owner Vivek Ranadivé has thrown out some...&lt;a href=""https://nba.nbcsports.com/2014/12/29/kings-finally-try-vivek-ranadives-4-on-5-cherry-picking-offense-with-disastrous-results-video/""&gt;interesting&lt;/a&gt; ideas over the years.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, in 2014 the Kings&amp;#39; D-League affiliate hired a coach specifically experiment with a professionally-unproven playstyle. The hire was Dave Arsenault, Jr., a former Grinnell basketball player and son of Grinnell Coach Arsenault. The playstyle was, of course, The System. The experiment lasted two seasons, with plenty of bumps and adjustments made to The System along the way (&lt;a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/feb/20/140-points-a-game-but-are-the-reno-bighorns-a-basketball-experiment-too-far""&gt;Les Carpenter wrote a great article on that first season&lt;/a&gt;). The experiment was discontinued after two seasons, but not before the Reno Bighorns posted a Western Conference-best 33-17 record in Coach Dave&amp;#39;s second season while running a version of The System modified for the D-League. Coach Dave has now taken over for his father as head coach at Grinnell and the Kings&amp;#39; G-League team runs a typical playstyle, but the Kings are still the only team in the NBA to have at least experimented with The System. Combine that with a roster suited for System success and a market that is ripe for having an exciting team to talk about, and the Kings make for the best-suited NBA team to take on The System.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR for Nephews&lt;/strong&gt; The Grinnell System makes the &amp;quot;Second Seconds or Less&amp;quot; Suns (a team before your time) look like the 2004 Pistons (another team before your time). Using 2018-19 NBA season data on key factors of &amp;quot;The System&amp;quot; in a model, four teams emerge as top candidates for The System (OKC, NOP, ATL, SAC). OKC has too much downside risk taking on The System, NOP has too much personnel flux and questions about outside shooting. ATL has no major cons, but no major pros in favor of The System. SAC has the personnel, the cultural fit, and a past history with The System that make it the front-runner for adopting this style in the NBA.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'nba', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2qo4s', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/nba', 'subreddit_subscribers': 2456098, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': None, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'thumbnail_height': None, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'title': '[OC] Kings of The System: Why the Sacramento Kings are the NBA team best-suited to run the Grinnell System', 'total_awards_received': 0, 'ups': 10, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/c6ru7u/oc_kings_of_the_system_why_the_sacramento_kings/', 'user_reports': [], 'view_count': None, 'visited': False, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}]",,,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

Who would have thought that we could see a team more front-loaded with high-end talent than the Warriors, let alone see one a single season after their own comes to an end? Obviously this is contingent on Leonard actually signing with the Lakers, but should that happen...We will see the ""superteam"" trend continue.

&amp;#x200B;

It started with the Garnett/Pierce/Allen superteam in Boston, which was replaced by the James/Wade/Bosh superteam in Miami. Once their reign came to an end, James went back to Cleveland to team up with Kyrie Irving and recruited Kevin Love to the team.

&amp;#x200B;

We all know what happened in 2016, when Durant decided to join the Warriors and form the biggest and baddest superteam in history. Two MVPs/top five players, and two more all-stars.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, now there is the potential for something even worse. A team with three of the seven best players in the league, including two who could both be argued to be the best. 

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, it's so absurd to me that the possibility of this is being met with such casualty, as if this is just the way the NBA is now, so we just accept it as fans..

&amp;#x200B;

If we apply this to a deal for Vooch over 4 years, we'd be looking at something like this.

2019-20 1st year: 25.5m

2020 - 21 2nd year: 23.5m 

2021 - 22 3rd year: 21.6m 

2022 - 23 4th year: 19.8m 

Now a reason why I think this works for both sides. 

1. JI and Fultz enters FA at the end of 2020-21

 This is the same time that Vuch is now down to 21.6m for the following season. 
Fournier's 17m is also off the books alongside Mozgov's 16.72m the previous season. 
This gives us the potential space to retain JI and (hopefully) Markelle. 


2. Bamba hits FA the same year AGs contract ends - at the end of the 2021-22 season. 

Vuch is then an expiring deal of 19.8m for the 2022-23 year
Orlando could look to move him here to clear space at either the deadline or during FA. This gives us potential flexibility to retain AG and Bamba without going deep into the luxury tax. 

3. If T Ross stays, its likely a 3 year or 4 year deal. Let's assume in this hypothetical that it's a 3 year, that means his deal also comes off the books that same season as Bamba and AGs deals end. 


Many Orlando fans assumed vuch is gone. I'm not proposing he does stay and this is all hypothetical, just breaking down some basic cap scenarios on what's been reported.

Bol and Porter both have massive offensive potential, and if you're adding that to an already deep team that should've made the Conference Finals last year, I trust that more than a top-heavy team.

The Center is a very rich position in terms of players, I have a list of 36 interesting players at the 5 (or players at the 4 that COULD be seen as a 5), excluding players like Gortat and Chandler that are a bit washed out.



Player | Player 2 | Player
------|--------|------
Vucevic | Horford | BroLo
Cousins | Valanciunas| DAJordan
Enes Kanter | WCStein | Young*
Vonleh | Dewayne Dedmon | Bobby Portis
Thomas Bryant | RoLo| Khem Birch
Ed Davis| Maxi Kleber | Taj
JaMychal Green | Faried | Zubac
Marjanovic | Kevon Looney | Holmes
Daniel Theis | Jordan Bell | KOQ
Muscala | McGee | Noah
Cheick Diallo| Salah Mejri| Zaza
Karmisnky| Kosta Koufos| Greg Monroe

&amp;nbsp;

Considering the conclusion of my last post mocking the 2019 Free Agency, the results of 2018 Free Agency (Hey Nerlens Noel) you'd expect there will be a lot of bargains out there. The Room and Tax MLE will be powerfull, and possibly the BAE (Bi-Annual Exception, at 3.6 million this year).

It might also be a lot of 1 year contracts, considering there are really no advantages in signing back-up centers to long salaries:

* Low trade value of back-up and even low tier starters at the 5, even if at good contracts (See Ivica Zubac)

* Flexibility going forward, possibility to get younger.

* No dead money risk from a injury or massive drop-off.

* There will always be a good center available at the next free agency

* You never know what's the next draft going to be, that roster spot and minutes might have better value next season on a Zach Collins kind of guy.

&amp;nbsp;

**Players I'd like to talk a bit about it:**

I don't quite like **Julius Randle**. He was a 20/10 players last season, but in a real playoff team what does he do? He is a big defense liability, still doesn't quite space the floor. It hurts too much to put him out there, I think he'll be too targetted in a playoff series. Randle's contract might be around 15+ million if the Knicks really strike out at everything else. I wouldn't pay him the MLE in this circumstances. 

**Aaron Baynes:** Baynes will be probably bought out by the Suns, and he absolutely could be a low-tier starter. If a team needing a back-up C decides to hold up it's room MLE for him it might really pay off.


&amp;nbsp;

**An interesting contract**: Is the Nerles Noel special. There are a lot of centers that will probably get the minimum. The top tier of these guys like Robin Lopez and possibly Kanter will have some teams competting, and a 1 + 1 at the minimum will be the contract to look out for. That means an player option on year 2, pretty much to give this guy some guarantee on being in the league next year. 

Other players might even have a hard time staying in the league, that could mean some 1 - 1 contracts, the Shabazz Napier, Pat Connaughton (although he I think it was the BAE) contract: A second year player option, giving it some upside for the team.

&amp;nbsp;

#Under the radar Free Agents

*Player name, age on day 1 next season, type of FA, team he lastly played for

**Ed Davis, 30 years old, UFA, Brooklyn Nets**

If you don't count the fake reserves like Harrell and Sabonis (they play starting minutes pretty much) Ed Davis was the best back-up center in last year's league. He's a good enough switch guy, rebounding machine, good defensive player, solid pick and roller. And it just doesn't seem the Market has turned that well for him. The Nets are reportedly going after DeAndre Jordan, so that's one less competitor. I'd love him on the 76ers.

*My prediction: 4-8 million*

**Nerlens Noel, 25 years old, UFA, OKC Thunder**

The Thunder are obviously too deep into the tax and they don't have bird rights to re-sign him even if he wasn't. Noel is a low tier-starter in this league IMO. He'd be absolutely great at any team just because of how well of a defender he's, but I'd really like him in the Celtics if they sign Kemba and end up without a starting Center. The Lakers would be good in terms of opportunity for him, or a team that miss out on a bigger center, like possibly the New Orleans Pelicans.
 
*My prediction: 4-6 million*

**Khem Birch, 27 years old, RFA, Orlando Magic**

This is more of a situational one, if the Magic actually re-sign Vucevic and T-Ross, they will be too close to the tax to re-sign him. Khem Birch was one of the best back-up centers in the league last year. If the Magic aren't willing to re-sign him, he could be in the room-MLE - taxpayer MLE level.

*My prediction: 4-8 million*

#Not Cheap might be worth it

Brook Lopez. But wait a minute, I think I have a better one: Not spending top dollars in the Center position. Honestly you can get production for so cheap that I rather just take the Warriors route.

**The Warriors route, 2015-19, Bogut/Zaza/Looney/Bell/Jones/Cousins**

Filling out your roster with 3 or 4 centers with them having different playstyles, so you can adequate it to your matchup.

Some suggestions: 

1. KOQ, Noel, JaMyChal Green

2. WCStein, Karmisnky, Bell

3. Davis, McGee, Theis, Noah

Just a thought, mix it up a slower great defensive center (Bogut), a switching guy (Looney/Bell) and a floor spacer (Cousins).

#Minimum players: best fill-out roster options

**Robin Lopez, 31 years old, UFA, Chicago Bulls**

He's 31 years old and 2 months. what's actually younger than I though he was. He's pretty much the definition of solid in the center position. Great block out guy, makes your team rebound better, good pick and roll, smart defender. And he's really stable, being pretty much a sure thing.

**Richaun Holmes, 26 years old, UFA, Phoenix Suns**

Holmes played really well this year, I love Ayton and his potential, but many times the Suns looked better with Holmes at the 5. He's still kind of young, last year he really simplified things: Stopped shooting 3s and just did the things he does best, rebounding, blocking shots, going strong in the pick and roll.

**Taj Gibson, 34 years old, UFA, Minnesota Timberwolves**

Honestly it's a bit more unrealistic for him to only get the minimum, I think the BAE or room MLE might be just as likely, but he would be such a great piece for the playoffs, he's still a great defender and rebounder, really smart and efficient guy that fits really well a team that actually wants to contend. When you're playing the finals, there's only about 2 or 3 bench guys that can actually play without killing you, if you get one of them for the minimum you're good. 

&gt;But he will  surely get the room MLE or part of the tax from someone

He earned 70 million dollars over his career (so that considerable money) though and he's 10 year veteran, so his minimum is $2,561,463, making the BAE not so lucrative and he could get a 1+1 worth 5.25 million, what's close in terms of guarantee money even to a team that gives him the full tax MLE. And maybe for that difference he just decides to play for the minimum for a team that offers a better option. I'd actually really like him on the Warriors.

&amp;nbsp;

#Investment

**Jordan Bell, 24 years old, RFA, GSWarriors**

The Warriors are reportedly really high on Damian Jones, so I don't expect them to bring Bell back on a long term contract, specially considering Green's salary in 2020 and that they've addded Smailagic who'll end up overlapping a bit with Bell.

Bell didn't play very well last year, but he had a great rookie season, a really smart player with some size issues, could be an useful piece on the playoffs more than in the regular season.

*My prediction: A 3 years BAE might be enough here (11.3 million - 3 years)

PS: **Why not Thomas Bryant**? Someone will probably think: The Wizards have to re-sign Ariza (at least they hope to), Jabari Parker, Bobby Portis (who they've traded for) and Satoransky (they don't have another PG on the books). They just might be in the tax when it's time for their last signing of these 5 players. And that could mean the player could easily walk. But I don't think they would simply give away Thomas Bryant for the BAE or something. If that was the case they would simply match it and them trade some of these players for value during the season. Ariza will probably be really tradeable close to the playoffs. I think it would've to be a 7+ million dollars offer per year to actually steal him from the Wizards. Bryant is 21 years old, but he's more of a back-up center right now, and I think a 24 million contract for him would be more of a fair offer than a bargain. Specially considering the down side of signing centers for multiple year that I've specified here.

#Just give him another shot

**Kenneth Faried, 29 years old, UFA, Houston Rockets**

Faried showed some range this past year, but he's really worth for bringing to the table offensive rebounding, switching ability and vertical spacing in the pick and roll. That's for a player that I honetly think will get the minimum or a 1+1 min. 

&amp;nbsp;

As well as listening to Lowe's last podcast with Windhorst talking about the Morris twins today.  As someone interested in the CBA/cap and transactions I was wondering who people think are the likely overpay candidates this summer as opposed to those who might be found as steals.  In 2016 we had some who maybe were showing signs of a player who could get a crazy contract (Biyombo) and some out of the blue (Turner).  Who do you think that could be this year?  

A few I think might be:

Terry Rozier: As a restricted free agent I wouldn't want to pay him much but can see a team after a PG who misses out on any of the top ones just deciding to pay him and get him from Boston, which seems like a bad idea after his last season.

Rajon Rondo: I just think he still could get some money off name recognition.

Kelly Oubre: Another RFA who seemed to put up decent counting stats on a bad team to end the year.  His advanced numbers have always been bad, he's not a very good shooter, and his defensive metrics have been poor wherever he's been.  He just looks like a player who does a lot of things that I don't really think he's good at.  Personally I think MLE money is even a bit high and could see him get double that or more.

Nikola Vucevic: Just had by far his best season in a contract year, and he was really a worthy all star I think.  But I don't really trust him to maintain it and think he might see a max.

The Blazers free agents (sorry Blazers fans!): I mean this almost in a good way but teams who make surprise playoff runs seem to get guys who play well during said runs paid.

Adam Silver wants to decrease the schedule in 2 years, with a number [as low as 58 games] (https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2019/06/26/nba-weighing-major-changes-schedule-postseason-tournament/1572491001/) for the regular season. Perfectly balanced home and away against each team in the leage. I think that would be a great place to pause the season for a single elimination tournament. The current schedule has the 58 game mark somewhere around the all star break, and that seems like a good break, maybe a week or 2 later to give more rest. 

#Single Elimination Tournament
They can keep ""tradition"" if they like and have 8 teams from each conference, but now it'll be the single elimination tournament. The 2 finalists will automatically qualify for the traditional NBA playoffs with home court throughout as the 1 and 2 seeds, and the winner gets a trophy or something I guess.

#NBA Group Stage
This is where the NBA tries to follow it's soccer dreams and mimic the world cup. We group the remaining 28 teams in to 7 groups of 4, each hosting the other 3 teams in their group twice each, or a total of 12 games per team. 

It's probably gonna take a month to get thru, but it will bring the guaranteed number of games played for 28 of 30 teams to 70, not as bad a cut from 82 as 58 would be, and also doesn't include the 15 games of the tournament making up 62.5% of the games missed by having the finalists of the tournament get group stage byes.

You can have a point system where wins are 3 points, OT wins are 2 points, OT losses are 1 points, and regulation losses are 0 points. Or go straight record and point differential as a tiebreaker or something, anything would be interesting. Top 2 teams from each group advance to the playoffs to join the elimination finalists, seeds after the bye teams can be based on overall season wins, including the 1st 58 games, results in the elimination tournament, and the group stage. Then NBA playoffs continue as normal.

#What This Accomplishes
This would effectively decrease the overall number of games played in the NBA prior to playoffs from 1230 to 1053, a decrease in 14.39% in overall games, which should in theory decrease the average games played per week per team from 3.15 to 2.7, which should hopefully be good enough to get rid of all back to back games, or at the very least, home and away back to backs. Players should get a bit more rest, and the NBA gets the single elimination tournament they've been dreaming of.

#Concerns
I have no idea what the 2 teams with group stage byes are gonna do for a month while the rest of the league is playing 12 games each. And I guess they're gonna need to make up the revenue of basically 6 less home games to sell tickets to per team. Also no idea how this would/should effect the draft. Statistics might suffer, but of the 27 all stars this year, only 13 of them played 74 games or more anyway, so there's already a high percentage of top talent missing more games now than this would lose as it is, the counting stats might not be as skewed as people might think.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,52885,public,self,Idea for Midseason Tournament and Playoffs,0,1561763839,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/c6cjxe/idea_for_midseason_tournament_and_playoffs/,,,,,,,,,,,,

A quick primer - the Rockets will take on Butler's $32.7m. As a taxpaying team that money has to equal 125% + $100k of what they're sending out. So working backwards, they need to send out $26.16m + $100k, so $26,260,000. The Celtics and Philly are not taxpaying teams in this scenario, so they can take on all of the salary they send out + $5m.

##Scenario 1a and 1b: Capela, Tucker, two end of bench guys

Clint Capela and PJ Tucker, plus Deyonta Davis and one from Hartenstein, Clark, Chiozza or Frazier would add up to $26,307,800, which works from Houston's angle. It would leave them with eight guys on the roster, and $7.4m under the hard cap (due to the sign-and-trade) to get up to twelve.

We're working under the assumption Boston takes Capela, and looking at their cap sheet, the only logical outgoing player is Marcus Smart. We can say Capela and Davis in, Smart out.

For Philly, they would take Tucker, Smart and the fourth player from Houston (let's just say Gary Clark, but it could be any of them). Maybe a pick from somewhere too. Neither Philly nor Boston have any cap complications on their end here.

Another option for Boston is to send out Gordon Hayward (to Philly). In this scenario, Boston would receive Capela, Tucker, Davis and the other dude.

Now, we can argue all day about who would be happy or angry at losing which player and for who, but these deals are threading the financial needle, and they both work.

[Take a look here to see both deals laid out.](https://i.gyazo.com/2ead001af019bd46bcae8c3294e13d08.png)

##Scenario 2a and 2b: Capela and Gordon

This is the second scenario from Houston's point of view. No other minimum guys going out, just those two. This means they'll get rid of a bit more money, giving them an additional $2.5m in flexibility to fill out the roster under the apron.

For Boston and Philly's point of view, it's largely similar to the deal above, except they won't take on any of the minimum guys, and that Philly get Gordon instead of Tucker.

It could be Smart and Gordon to Philly and Capela to Boston, or Hayward to Philly and Capela &amp; Gordon to Boston...

[Take a look here to see both deals laid out.](https://i.gyazo.com/4c7f5c95ed44295b678974a9a590a494.png)

##Conclusion

There are probably several more complicated ways to do this deal, including dragging even more teams in, adding some sign-and-trades, or even adding in players we would never guess the teams would part with. However, I think the deals above look the simplest and most logical, given all the information we have (Houston wants Butler, Boston needs a starting center, Philly want something back **if** Butler is set on leaving).

It should be noted that, from Boston's perspective, this deal can still be done while leaving space for Kemba Walker to sign. Or even after they sign him, if they do. The most expensive of these deals for Boston (trade 1 - taking on Capela and Davis) would see them have to renonuce the holds on Theis, Wanamaker and Gibson. This would leave them with [$32.8m in cap space](https://i.gyazo.com/f3fd43673c992486bd7be030d6c56dd5.png) to sign Walker's $32.7m max.

Take a look....



With talk of a season restructuring in the news, how does the NBA create a full season worth watching for as many teams' fans as possible? How can you pack more excitement into the beginning, middle, and end of the season?

​

One answer: you crown a champion twice.

​

Instead of a mid-season tournament, the NBA should adopt a different soccer feature: a balanced regular season.

If you played a balanced regular season (home and home with all 29 other teams), you would have a very exciting October-February race for the championship. Creating a new trophy to award the best regular season team in the balanced format would mean something more than the best record means now. It would also give the league a big boost in the mid-season as the championship race reaches its end. If you tie a certain number of Playoff entries to the other top finishers, you create drama to enter the top 10 (or 8, or 12, whatever).

​

The league then can have the regular playoff format that matches the top teams and works well already, but with a twist: tie the remaining Playoff entries to a ""group stage"" or round robin playoffs after the regular season. Make every team eligible for the final 6 spots (or 8, or 4). This would work best built around the current Division structure, but it could be drawn differently each year just as easily.

​

​

You can do all this in 82 games, 74, or whatever round number you like best. You get exciting basketball for every team at the beginning and the end of the season, and most teams will have something to play for in the mid-season as well. You get a new measuring stick for NBA greatness. You get to keep the Playoffs and Finals, the best part of the season now.

​

This format would address the problems with late season tanking. Teams wouldn't lose everything because of a key injury at a bad time. You can figure out Draft position later within the new rules. I think this would do a lot of good to renew interest in the league during the regular season.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,52741,public,self,The NBA needs something bigger than a no-stakes midseason tournament - I think I have the answer,0,1561732793,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/c66bl2/the_nba_needs_something_bigger_than_a_nostakes/,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’d guess the main points of debate would be if Kemba fits Boston’s timeline (whatever that is) and  whether he is poised to age gracefully as a 29-year-old short PG; but any potential further insight is appreciated.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,52741,public,self,"If you were in Danny Ainge’s shoes, would you pursue Kemba Walker?",0,1561731714,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/c6644w/if_you_were_in_danny_ainges_shoes_would_you/,,,,,,,,,,,,

I can see where that came from. If I'm not crazy, I think the players can negotiate with their current teams before free-agency comes, so it makes sense that Walker was unhappy with the offer and his camp released this news to attract market.

Now, Woj reported later that the Celtics are frontrunners to sign him. How can he say that? I don't think Kemba's camp would release that without having a meeting with Ainge first, and also that wouldn't be beneficial for him since other teams might not engage in the run for him knowing another team has an advantage before the negotiation period even start. And if Kemba and Boston did meet, doesn't that break the rules? Also, they apparently are doing so in a very open way, since the most famous reporter is releasing the news.

Does someone here knows how that works?

It basically describes how the NBA wants to shorten the season and include more entertaining events to the regular season. I highly recommend you read it. Anyway in response to that I was thinking of a way the NBA could change up the schedule. It seems that the most popular idea is reducing the schedule to fifty-eight games. In that case, every team would play every other team twice. Once at home and once on the road. The NBA also wants to add a midseason tournament as well as a postseason play-in tournament. I personally love this idea, and when I heard of it I immediately thought of how far the NBA could take this. The midseason tournament may sound confusing, but think of it as the [Champions League](https://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2014/9/11/6135491/uefa-champions-league-guide) in soccer. The NBA could keep it as simple as a randomly drawn eight team tournament in which the winner gets a nice shiny trophy, or make it more rewarding. The NBA could contact various other professional basketball leagues across the globe. They would then gather the best international club teams like Panathinaikos (Greece), Real Madrid (Spain), or the Sydney Kings (Australia). This would gather the best basketball players in the world to compete in one tournament for bragging rights as well as the opportunity to claim the title of world champions. Many of you may be opposed to this, but keep in mind this is a concept. It would be a controlled sixteen to twenty team tournament, but enough of that. Back to the reason we came here. The NBA could shorten the schedule to around sixty-eight games. So take the fifty-eight game schedule and add ten games to it. As I stated before The fifty-eight games allows the teams to play each other twice once at home, and once on the road. The other ten games would be dedicated to randomized opponents. This schedule not only takes away fourteen games from the schedule, but makes enough room for the midseason tournament I mentioned before. I want to hear your thoughts. If you read the entire thing, thank you. I'd love to hear feedback though, all of this is a concept remember that.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,52681,public,self,NBA Alternative Schedule,0,1561693615,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/c60lne/nba_alternative_schedule/,,,,,,,,,,,,

How would you address this?

But first my take.

1. 72 game season. Two vs out of conference (1 home, 1 away), three vs in conference (1 home, 1 away, 1 neutral). Neutral games take place in cities (national and international) that don't already have a team and have a facility that can support an NBA game.

2. Eliminate the preseason. Reduce the risk of injuries before the actual season and shave ~3 games off the wear and tear.

3. Season starts Oct.1 and ends Apr.1. This will stretch the season out about an extra month, but by cutting the preseason it won't ""feel"" like it. By stretching the season out a little longer and reducing the amount of games the average amount of games per week a team will play will be a few points below 3. This should eliminate all back-to-back games except in the most rare of circumstances.

4. Mandatory 1 week off for All-Star Week.

5. Mandatory 3 days off starting at the designated trade deadline date. This allows for teams to immediately use the new player and prevents any odd situations where a player could be playing while being traded.

6. 2 weeks between the end of season and start of playoffs (official start date is Apr.15). This allows several things: increased chance of healthy players at the start of the playoffs, reduces the necessity of resting players at the end of the season, and offers an opportunity to host the award ceremony while it's still relevant.

7. The first two rounds of the playoffs are Best-Of-5, the last two rounds are Best-Of-7. Official dates are: Round 1- Apr.15 to Apr.25, Round 2- Apr.29 to May.9, Round 3 - May.13 to May.26, Round 4 (Finals) - Jun.1 to Jun.14.

I'm a young adult and the success I have seen has been limited. I never saw the finals teams outside clips, stories, and highlights, so the best I saw was reaching the second rounds. Kyrie and KD are game changers. I understand that, I like Kyrie and KD as players and even if they seen annoying and unlikeable off the court I will do my best to suppor them.

   BUt deep inside when D lo leaves, I just don't feel I can be really happy and honestly angry. I would love D lo with anyone from Kawhi, KD, and Kyrie. But the way it looks, HE IS GONE.

  I know the doubts and arguments. I won't deny it and it pains me that even after proving what I always wanted and thought he could do, when we got him for Lopez, he still hasn't achieved being the Net he could be. But as a fan, I never really became fan of players throughout my years. The only player or players I was huge fans of were probably VC, Kidd, and maybe Joe Johnson. But for years I didn't get that attachment. I thought it was dumb and when we traded Lopez, I didn't get that upset when he traded him. But when he got D lo, IDK why but I just saw a guy who could prove people wrong and become a star. I thought getting him was the best deal we could get for Lopez, and we were starless and talentless. D lo was argubaly the first step in getting us to where we are right now. It sucks and I put team first, but D lo has become somone I value too much and is my favorite player on my team. I just feel angry he is going to go and just don't get why I am not right or what he did wrong. 

   I feel bad, I know people think this is dumb and that Kyrie and KD is just the better option. I think there ias a decent potion of the fanabse who wants D lo over Kyrie so I guess I am not totally a lone. Again, this should be what makes us better, but deep inside my heart, I just want D lo here. I believe with him with any star or player we will be better and great. I don't know ifthere is any argument, but again I hope there is and feel there is an argument to be made. I believe he can play and has a talent that people need to appreciate. I know his poor finishing is not ideal, but I saw this guy do crazy things this year and has driven to the rim with ease at times. I believe he can play. No one on our team, even from levert to DInwiddie, are offensively gifted as D lo. THey cannot score the way D lo can do and cannot pass the way D lo does. It's ahrd to explain, but I got to admit, I am just really bummed D lo will be gone even with Kyrie or KD. I'm going to have to move on and WILL, but D lo going makes things hard.

Eric Gordon is on an expiring deal and he can slide right into Iman Shumpert's role from last year off the bench. Except Gordon is much better than Shumpert, so he'll immediately give the bench a lift.

In 2016, KD left a Thunder team and joined a great team in GS and eventually won 2 championships in 3 appearances and also won that validation (somewhat) from the fans and media that he could win a championship.

So I guess what I’m saying is that playing with another all time goat contender has largely nullified players chances at becoming GOAT:

For instance: 

Kobe Bryant has 5 rings, but earned 3 of them with Shaq, who is often considered a top ten player of all time. 

As a result LeBron James, who has 3 rings, is widely considered a better all time player than Kobe Bryant. 

Another example is Kareem Abdul Jabbar, he won 6 rings, but 5 were won alongside Magic Johnson, who is universally considered a top ten player of all time. So although he has 6 championships in more appearances than Jordan, Jordan is given the GOAT nod instead.

This is one potential scenario: 

Sixers get: Eric Gordon, Spencer Dinwiddie, Taurean Prince, Rockets’ 2021 first-round pick, Rockets’ 2023 first-round pick  
Rockets get: Jimmy Butler  
Nets get: Clint Capela

Only problem is, now the Nets have both Capela and Allen as their big centers. Both are great centers. Capela is currently better than Allen in most of the stat departments, but Allen isn’t very far off. The problem is, you realistically can’t/shouldn’t start both. So who are you going with in the future? 

Capela is the better player right now. Stats prove it. But he also gets injured a lot. He’s also coming from a really good connection with James Harden that took years to get highly successful

Allen is not as good as Capela CURRENTLY, but he’s also 4 years younger than Capela. This year Capela averaged 3 more PPG and 4 more RPG than Allen, but Capela also only played 67 games while Allen played 80. I feel like in the years to come (especially in the 4 years it takes to get to Capela’s age), Allen will become the better player. The stats are similar and he’s only 21, so I believe by 25, he will be better than Capela was. 

So who would you take for the present and the future? Capela is better right now so that would maybe help win more games and he’s on a deal for the next couple of years. So that would be an immediate boost. But Allen is still only 21  and is still on his rookie deal for cheap and he would then become a UFA and could be kept for the next 7 years and would be the same age that capela would be when his deal expires in 2-3 years.

Another great addition was made by /u/thedarkwingthatducks , there are 290 rostered spots right now, with the probable addition of about 45 players by draft + come over from europe (Like Nando de Colo and Vincent Poirier) + 2 way players that actually sign deals (Like Caruso), there just might be about 115 to 110 roster spots available, even though there are at least 140 players in the Free Agency that are true NBA players. So many might come short in terms of roster spots, what might just means some going to China, some signing a prove yourself 2 way deal (4 year or younger veterans though) like Rodney McGruder.

There are about 200 players entering the 2019 Free Agency, and only 13 to 15 teams will actually have cap space:



Teams | Projected Space
-----|---------------
Atlanta | $13.0 MM
Boston | $34.1 MM
Brooklyn | $68.7 MM
Chicago | $21.0 MM
Dallas | $29.9 MM
Indiana | $34.1 MM
Clippers | $51.8 MM
Lakers | $27.8 MM
Bucks | $19.5 MM
NOLA | $30.3 MM
New York | $70.5 MM
Phoenix | $14.1 MM
Kings | $62.6 MM

Projected cap space done by Keith Smith. Some things are addepted: The Nets and the Nuggets cap space.

Some assumptions here: Nuggets opt in with Paul Millsap and Nets rennounce (in some point) D'Angelo Russell.

#Total Cap space: 477.4 Million dollars.

And that's with 70 million from the Knicks, who are still in the beggining of their rebuild. A good part of the most coveted free agents are actually **old veterans** and will be something very interesting.

You can already guess that this means a lot of players will be without a chair when the music stops, and a lot of bargains will happen. But to help understading how bad it is, I will mock the max FA and see how much money is left after that. I'm not being partial here, I don't really care where this guys go, I just want to know how much money will the 2nd tier get.

#Mocking the max FA situations:

I will use a lot of tables in this post so it's easier to see.

 

Player | Team he signs
------|-------------
Kevin Durant | Brooklyn Nets
Kawhi Leonard | Toronto Raptors
Kyrie Irving | Brooklyn Nets
Klay Thompson | GSW
Kemba Walker | Boston Celtics
Jimmy Butler | Phillly 76ers
Tobias Harris | Indiana Pacers
Khris Middleton | Milwaukee Bucks

That's a simulation with only 4/9 players actually changing teams, the more the players change from a team that will  be capped out even if they lose him to a team that had cap space, the lesser money will be around for 2nd tier guys. The new projected space would look like:

Teams | Projected Space
-----|---------------
Atlanta | $13.0 MM
Chicago | $21.0 MM
Dallas | $29.9 MM
Clippers | $51.8 MM
Lakers | $27.8 MM
Bucks | $19.5 MM
NOLA | $30.3 MM
New York | $70.5 MM
Phoenix | $14.1 MM
Kings | $62.6 MM
New Total | **$340.5 MM**

PS: Charlotte, 76ers, Warriors still wouldn't have projected cap space.

340.5 Million dollars isn't a lot. That can give you 20 x 17 million dollar salaries. Now let's see a list of players you'd expect to get more than the MLE but less than the max, using an descending money expected to be earn order:

#The 20 miliion plus group

No. | Player
---|------
1 | Al Horford
2 | Nikola Vucevic
3 | Harrison Barnes
4 | D'Angelo Russell
5 | Malcom Brogdon

These players I'd expect to have a 20+ million market. A lot of teams are considering overpaying for Brogdon, Russell will have a market, and there are reports that Barnes opted out of his contract expecting to receive an about 20/yera one.

Al Horford contract reportedly has a 114 million dollar offer, considering the team will probably front load it, that's a hair under 31 million dollars in his first year. 

Let's mock it:



Player | Money on first year |Team he signs
---|-------------------|----
Al Horford | $31,000,000 | Dallas
D'Angelo Russell | $25,000,000 | NY Knicks
Malcom Brogdon | $21,000,000 | Chicago Bulls
Harrison Barnes | $21,000,000 | Kings
Nikola Vucevic | Re-signs | Orlando Magic

That gives you $95 million less in money, with the Bucks regaining 3 million dollars in cap space without Brogdon's cap hold.

#Total Cap Space: 245.5 million

Now we have the 3rd tier group, with players there are rumors of 14-20 million dollars (Windhorst recently said he expects Patrick Beverley to get 14-15 million).

&amp;nbsp;

#The 3rd tier

No. | Player
---|------
6 | Bojan Bogdanovic
7 | Brook Lopez
8 | Danny Green
9 | Pat Beverley
10 | Nikola Mirotic

These players have good age and would fit well a lot of teams. They're all highly coveted and will have a lot of pursuers. 

Bucks expect to bring Brook Lopez back. On our mock they have 22.5 million to do that and that will be enough, but I'd expect for them to be out of bigger than MLE Cap Space after, basically dropping out of our list.

The Clippers ($51.8MM), Kings ($41.6 MM) and the Knicks ($45.5 MM) still have a lot of cap space here. 



Player | Money on 1st yr | Team he signs
---|---|----
Bojan Bogdanovic | $19,000,000 | LA Clippers
Brook Lopez | $17,000,000 | Bucks
Danny Green |$15,000,000 | LA Lakers
Pat Beverley | $14,000,000| Clippers
Nikola Mirotic | $14,000,000 | Kings

Let's take a look how is our projected cap space right now.

Teams | Projected Space
-----|---------------
Atlanta | $13.0 MM
Clippers | $18.8 MM
Lakers | $12.8 MM
NOLA | $30.3 MM
New York | $45.5 MM
Phoenix | $14.1 MM
Kings | $27.6 MM
New Total | **$162.1 MM**

The new outlook here isn't counting the Bucks because they'd have only 5 million, what's pretty much the Room MLE. 

162 million to pretty much 150 players in this league isn't looking good. Of course we still have the MLE but we're walking towards the moneypocalypse. 

#The next under 15 million group of guys:

No. | Player
---|------
11 | Jeremy Lamb
12 | Terrence Ross
13 | Dewayne Dedmon
14 | Terry Rozier
15 | DeMarcus Cousins
16 | Thaddeus Young  
17 | Tomas Satoransky 
18 | Marcus Morris 
19 | Trevor Ariza 
20 | George Hill

 
Let's go straight to the mock:

Player | Money on 1st yr | Team he signed
---|---|----
Jeremy Lamb | $13,000,000 | Atlanta
Terrence Ross | $12,000,000 | NOLA
Dewayne Dedmon |$15,000,000 | NOLA
Terry Rozier | $14,000,000| Phoenix Suns
Cousins | $20,000,000 (1yr) | Knicks
Thaddeus Young | I'm not sure | 
Tomas Satoransky| $13,000,000 | NY Knicks
Marcus Morris |$18,000,000 | LA Clippers
Trevor Ariza| $10,000,000 (1yr) | Sacramento Kings
Hill | $12,500,000 | Lakers

Without much options, the Knicks decide to risk for Cousins, but on a small term contract. The Suns got their new point guard, Atlanta got a good player for cheap that fits them. Clippers got Marcus Morris on the Avery Bradley/Derrick Favors deal, with an unguaranteed 2nd year with a late date. NOLA is reportedly looking for a new center, and they found one of the most wanted free agents. Thaddeus Young simply ran out of money + fit, and that's where it''s intersting:

Teams | Projected Space
-----|---------------
New York | $10.5 MM
Kings | $17.6 MM
New Total | **$28.1 MM**

Basically, we ran out of money. With 19 players. 

&amp;nbsp;

#The next crop of wanted players

No. | Player
---|------
21 | Rudy Gay
22 | Jonas Valenciunas
23 | Julius Randle
24 | Rodney Hood 
25 | Derrick Rose
26 | Seth Curry
27 | Al Farouq Aminu  
28 | Darren Collinson 
29 | Ricky Rubio
30 | Wesley Matthews 
31 | Cory Joseph
32 | JaMychal Green
33 | Mike Scott
33 | Garrett Temple
34 | Iman Shumpert 
35 | Nerlens Noel
36 | Enes Kanter
37 | Jabari Parker
38 | Ed Davis
39 | Austin Rivers
40 | Taj Gibson
41 | Elfrid Payton
42 | Reggie Bullock

I'm already excluding some restricted free agents that I think are pretty likely to re-sign and not impact the overall free agency money (Like Bobby Portis and Kelly Oubre Jr). But that's 20 players that I thouhgt were going to get some money, but right now I'm just not sure. The teams' money is pretty much over and right now they would only have the MLE. 

Exceptions: Valenciunas, Derrick Rose, Jabari Parker (will probably re-sign with it's original team).

Julius Randle seem to have made a meh decision, as he's not even that guaranteed to get the full non-MLE. Oh, and what teams actually have a full non taxpayer MLE?



Team | How likely to use it?
----|---------------------
Detroit | 20%
Nuggets | 20%
Charlotte | 10%
GS Warriors | 100% (keeping one of Klay and KD)
Houston | 70%
Memphis | 50%
Minnesota | 90%
Orlando | 80%
Philly | 100%
Portland | 30%
San Antonio | 100%
Utah | 90%
Washington | 10%

I think it's a pretty likely universe **where only 7 MLE will be available to players**, and that's if teams don't decide to just give part of it to 2nd round players. That would mean that player from the level of Darren Collinson will be available in the Free Agency for less than the MLE, actually for the Taxpayer MLE or the room expection.

That also shows a **very scary world for center**, because names like: Robin Lopez, JeVale McGee, Jordan Bell, DeAndre Jordan, Faried, Zubac, Looney, Noah, Holmes are probably not even getting any kind of money, just going for the minimum salary. 

**Other players that felt to the minimum salary level:** DeMarre Carroll, Alec Burks, Wilson Chandler, KCP, Justin Holiday, Jeremy Lin, James Ennis, Wayne Ellington, TJ McConnell, Ish Smith, Jeff Green, Rajon Rondo, Danuel House, Rondae Hollis Jefferson, Gerald Green, Kyle O'Quinn, MCW, Luc Moute. 

If their original teams don't bail them out, these players may very much be available for the minimum

#Conclusion

Patient teams that wait out the market will find a lot of bargains in this free agency. That puts teams like the Lakers, top heavy teams that will have to fill their roster with short money, in prime situation, particularly because these guys will want a 1+1, or a just 1 year prove yourself minimum and the Lakers can give them minutes to excel at. 

PS: I know that the timing of the signings matter, and some players that are very much down my line of best available will be signed for more than they would go in this mock, but my intention here was really to try to understand how much money ist out there, some guys in my minimum level might get full MLEs, and it only takes 1 team to give out a lot of money to my 30-40 tier and that's part of randomness of multiple teams taking different decisions at different timings. I hope you guys like it.

When you look around the league, the majority of teams have some semblance of an identity, and have pinpointed players they want to build around for the next however many years. 

With that being said, this offseason quietly seems to have the potential to uproot all of that. The top tier guys on the market have been covered at length, but it seems like the perfect storm is brewing for some team-crippling deals. Over the entire league, there is $347 million dollars in cap space available to be spent, more than the past 2 offseasons *combined*. 

If a team like the Sixers strikes out on Al Horford, who's to say they won't give Bobby Portis a 50 million dollar deal?

If you could read or feed back on the post I would appreciate it a lot, but I also think it would be a good topic of discussion here.

This means a minimum of 420 players will be signed to NBA contracts when the season finally arrives.

As of now, there is projected to be $473,908,840 in total cap space across the league. 

Sounds like a lot - but let's dig into it. As of this moment, there are 288 players under contract combined between all 30 teams. That is around 68% of the way to guaranteeing the league average of 14 players per roster. The NBA Draft just happened, so let's say 42 of those players (an average number for draft classes) sign to actual NBA contracts, not two way deals. So \~18 players either play G League or stay foreign. Due to the fact that all 42 of these players can sign with their teams regardless of cap space (rookie exception) we will keep our original cap space number the same.

So that leaves us with 330 out of 420 (minimum) roster spots taken with about $474 million in 2019-20 money to give out. If you were to average that out among 90 players, each of them would receive $5.267 million salaries next season. Obviously, this isn't a good representation of the market due to exceptions like the MLE, BAE, and bird rights. A good amount of those 90 roster spots will be filled by guys already on the team, and many of them will be able to sign regardless of cap space if that team has their bird rights. 

My point, however, is this:

Let's say Irving ($32.7m), Durant ($38.2m), Horford ($28m), Randle ($20-25m), and Tobias ($25-30m) all decide to join new teams. Those 5 players alone will command in the $150 million dollar range of 2019-20 contract value. That number steadily rises with possible moves of Vucevic, Cousins, Bogdanovic, Lopez, and Marc Gasol. Imagine how the number jumps if guys who look like they might stay - Kemba, Kawhi, or Jimmy Butler - decide to leave as well. 

**So who will suffer the consequences of having less cap space available if they want to move teams?**

For me, it is the guys who aren't star players but are good players that will be looking for new homes in a few weeks. Some of them won't be able to sign with their current teams using bird rights, and might be left with whatever money is left after the first wave of free agents sign. Some guys I could see signing deals for less than we might be imagining now:

Danny Green, Toronto Raptors

Bobby Portis, Washington Wizards

 Not only does the acknowledgement of these regular season award winners happen away from the fans and teammates of these winners at an exclusive showing in LA, but it also happens more than two months after the regular season ended! All our basketball minds can think of is what transpired over the postseason, and not what happened in the very distant regular season! All of these awards should be celebrated with the fans and teammates who stood by the respective winner throughout the whole season. 

The delayed awards recognition also takes away the competitive edge during the playoffs that comes along with knowing who the league MVP is. If we know who the current MVP is come playoff time it creates headlines and excitement for him and his team. In 1997 Karl Malone edged out Jordan for MVP, but the two met later in the finals. This created so much hype and tension for the series as it was the battle between the MVP Malone and the greatest to ever lace em up who had just lost the MVP that season.

So even if you re-sign Millsap to a 3/30 you only have $5M to work with. He's 34.

If they decline him outright there is only $15M to work with but there's no one that can replace his defense and spacing for any money this year, except Horford but he's only a year younger. 

The team will be over the cap for the forseeable future after Murray's extension, so if they give either of these guys a long term this year they will retire after it, leaving only the MLE for a replacement if Porter Jr., Vanderbilt, and Hernangomez can't step up. The first 2 are chronic injury sufferers. 

If they can find (or sign, maybe there's someone out there) a younger player on a non-expiring, they would be able to use Early Bird Rights to extend them over the cap. 

They have Barton's 4Y/54M to trade/dump, which would give them ~$25M in cap space this year if they decline Millsap. Maybe they can absorb someone's bad money to make up for the outgoing talent disparity. Coincidentally the ~$25M matches up with the rumored 4Y/112M deal Horford supposedly has waiting for him.

Barton really looks like the odd one out as a healthy Nuggets squad does not have enough minutes to go around at the 3 to begin with -  Craig, Barton, Beasley, Hernangomez, Vanderbilt all ate there last year, and there's still Porter Jr. - and everyone else is on a minimum or a rookie deal.

Sounds crazy at first. But dig deeper. 

2016 Steph vs 2019 Steph

I think 2019 Steph is the better overall player. 2016 Steph had a better regular season? Yes. But we all know the Warriors after 5 Finals runs were coasting during the regular season. 

2016 Playoffs: 25/5/5 on 60.3% TS

2019 Playoffs; 28/6/6 on 62.0% TS

Steph had better stats in 2019. Steph is now stronger, more experienced, and a better defender. And most important he wasn't days removed from spraining his knee. Steph's inability to shake off Love is iron clad proof that Steph was not close to 100%. 2019 Steph was healthy and it showed.

2016 Klay vs 2019 Klay

2019 Klay is far superior. He is a much more versatile scorer. Much better off the dribble and attacking the rim. 

2016 Finals: 20 points on 56% TS

2019 Finals: 26 points on 70.6% TS

2016 Draymond vs 2019 Draymond

We all know Draymond was out of shape and coasting for most of the 2019 regular season. But when the playoffs started he was back to being 2016 Draymond on defense and on the boards. But Draymond did drop off hard from 3FG.

2016 Iggy vs 2019 Iggy

During the 2019 playoffs Iggy said he never felt this good in years. And it showed on the court. The guy was an absolute beast guarding Harden and knocking down huge shots.

2016 Playoffs: 9/4/4 on 56.3% TS

2019 Playoffs: 10/4/4 on 56.5% TS

So looking the Core 4: the teams look equal. Curry and Klay were better in 2019 and Draymond better in 2016. Iggy about the same. The 3 All Stars are still in their prime in 2019 and have more experience and confidence. My conclusion is the Top4 guys on the 2016 and 2019 team is the same.

Now lets look at the role players.

2019 - Looney, Cousins, McKinney, Cook, Bogut, Livingston

2016 - Barnes, Ezeli, Barbosa, Speights, Bogut, Livingston

I'll take Looney over any of the depth pieces in 2016. Barnes was total crap in the Finals. 35/31/60 Shooting splits with a 43% TS. Looney was much better. I'd take Cousins over Barbosa for scoring off the bench. Both average 8 per game but Cousins also added 5 rebounds and 2.5 assists. 

Ezeli was total crap because he was playing on one leg. The guy should have not even played and was useless. He never played an NBA game since. Speights was unplayable after Game 4 because of his poor defense and the Cavs attacking every weak defender. He averaged 2 points per game. That was inferior to McKinney who could actually stay on the court as a solid wing defender. 

2016 Bogut of course is better then 2019. But Bogut played a grand total of 8 minutes in Game5-Game7 because he broke his leg. 2019 Bogut was superior from Game 5 - Game 7 because he could actually play.

2016 Livingston is superior compared to 2019. But he is zero threat from 3FG, while Cook adds the shooting the Warriors needed.

Overall the role players were very even. If Bogut/Ezeli were healthy I would easily give the edge to 2016. But both were injured badly and basically contributed zero in Game 5, 6, and 7. The role player bigs from 2019 were far superior. I'll take Looney, Cousins, and old but available Bogut over injured Bogut, injured Ezeli, and Anderson Varajao.

Now lets look at injures. All in all the 2016 and 2019 teams are about equal.

2019 Klay missed a full game. But Green got suspended in Game 5.

2019 Klay missed 4th quarter of Game 6. But they got 12 minutes of KD in Game 5 to off set.

2019 Klay missed 4th quarter of Game 2. True. But Warriors still won that game anyway so it didn't hurt them.

2019 Looney got banged up but still played at a solid level. 2016 Ezeli got hurt and never played another NBA game.

2019 Cousins was not 100%. But 2016 Bogut broke his leg and only played 8 minutes in the last 3 games.

2019 Steph was basically 100% healthy. 2016 Steph sprained his knee days before and was obviously hampered.

So looking at injury and suspensions, both teams basically faced similar situations. Both faced 1 impossible game (2019 Warriors without Klay in Game 3 and 2016 Warriors without Green in Game 5)

But then people say the Warriors were missing $30 million in salary because KD was out in 2019. Sure. But the 2019 Warriors were also massively over the salary cap and luxury line. The 2016 Warriors didn't pay a cent of luxury tax.

2019 Warriors without KD's salary: $16 million over the Salary Cap

2016 Warriors without Bogut's salary: $12 million over the Salary Cap

So the 2019 Warriors were actually more 'whole' salary wise WITHOUT KD then the 2016 Warriors were without Bogut. 

CONCLUSION:

The 2016 Warriors (Game 5, Game 6, Game 7) were basically the same talent wise as the 2019 Warriors.

These facts diminish the accomplishments of the 2016 Cavs winning Game 5, 6, and 7.

I think Lonzo will do really well next to Holiday and with Zion, Hayes and whomever they sign in FA (assuming they do) down low. If Vuc leaves the Magic, I think Bamba could do really well, but he wasn’t all that impressive in the time he did play last year. Also on a similar front, you do you see have a slip or drop off in production next year? Kyle Lowry is my pick, although I’m still high on the Raptors for obvious reasons.

The MVP is the most inconsistent award. When Harden had better stats than Curry in 2014-2015 and led the rockets to the 2 seed with 56 wins with less the narrative was best “best player on the best team”. So okay. Curry Wins. 

Then comes 2016-2017. Harden doesn’t have the better stats this time around, (averages 2 less rebounds while shooting a better % from the field) but is the best player on the better team (3seed vs a 6seed). But then this year the narrative is that “oh Westbrook had less help than Harden and still pulled his team to the playoffs.”But when this narrative could’ve been used in Hardens favor in 2014-2015 people were saying “you can’t use that against Curry it’s not his fault his teammates are better.” 

So Harden can lead the Rockets to a .683 in 2014-2015 with less help (the warriors .817) and not have this narrative used in his favor. But In 2016-2017 he can have a .671 and have the narrative flipped on him to help a guy with a .573. How can you seriously say as a sixth seed he’s more valuable than Harden. But then not use this very same narrative in his favor when it would benefit him. 

Harden has been robbed twice in the past and a third time this year imo.

Hey Guys,

So half a year ago I created a ranking off of voting on r/nba that crowned Lebron James (shockingly) the best player in the world. [You can see your top 20 players and people's reactions here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/a9ormi/the_peoples_top_20_players_in_the_league_rnbas/). Much has changed since then including the rise of Giannis Antetokounmpo, James Harden &amp; Kawhi Leonard throughout the season as the Toronto Raptors rose to claim the title of the 2019 NBA Champions. It's time to see how people's opinions have changed.

Would however love to see the differences in opinion between r/nba and r/nbadiscussion so will put up a second poll to see who you guys think are the best players in the NBA.

#The Starting Candidates

*[] (/LAL) Lebron James - 27.4/8.5/8.3 on .588 TS 55GP*

*[] (/GSW) Stephen  Curry - 27.3/5.3/5.2 on .641 TS 69GP*

*[](/GSW) Kevin Durant - 26.0/6.4/5.9 on .631 TS 78GP*

*[](/TOR) Kawhi Leonard - 26.6/7.3/3.3 on .606 TS 60 GP*

*[](/MIL) Giannis Antetokounmpo - 27.7/12.5/5.9 on .644 TS 72GP*

*[](/LAL) Anthony Davis - 25.9/12.0/3.9 on .597 TS 56GP*

*[](/HOU) James Harden - 36.1/6.6/7.5 on .616 TS 78GP*



**Rules &amp; Guidelines**

The same rules apply as always:

- Results will be posted the next day with the announcement of the next poll.

- Obviously, most votes wins unless it's particularly close where a poll with just the 2 leading candidates will be opened (when the margin of victory is less than 5% of total votes)

- Taking note of your feedback from the last ranking, from now on regardless of how close the voting is the winner will be crowned as the player with more total votes in showdowns

- *Any serious player suggestions will be added to the pool on request*

On the other side of things James Harden would be Western Conference MVP while Paul George or Nikola Jokic are the runner-up.

He did so on a team that has very good, but not elite, players - and therefore a reasonable case can be made that their success in the season is largely attributable to him. Basketball Reference suggests he led the league this regular season in Win Shares, Offensive Win Shares and VORP.

Giannis is an elite player - no doubt about it. He has made an already good (perhaps very good) team one of the East’s top tier teams. He put up very good numbers and was extremely efficient. 

In most other years - Giannis should be a lock.

Ultimate lineups playing in different eras would obviously have different makeups. 

An important thing to consider with any ultimate lineup is minimizing weaknesses. In that vein, it is important to have players that can play on both ends of the floor. Someone who is an offensive or defensive liability (relative to other greats) can be exploited. 

Another thing is chemistry, and the ability to fill different roles. Redundancy in some skills, like shooting, is a good thing. In others, like ball dominance, it is a detriment. 

For a modern lineup, versatility on defense is key. So is shooting, not just from three but from all over the floor. 

The lineup I've come up with, unsurprisingly, is made up of modern players. I did consider older players, but their skills seemed to be tailored better to the game of their era.  Without further ado...  


&gt;\-LeBron James: The primary facilitator on offense, simply an excellent playmaker and passer. At his peak, he was an above average shooter. One of the very best finishers ever. Good rebounder. Outstanding defensively, at his peak, he had the speed and strength to defend both guards and bigs.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Klay Thompson: The second-best shooter of all time, he doesn't need the ball in his hands but must be guarded at all times. This makes him very valuable. Very good defensively, he has the strength and quickness to defend both guards and forwards.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Kawhi Leonard: Perhaps the best perimeter defender ever at his peak. His defensive strength, skills, and quickness and incredible. Has experience playing off-ball. Can score from anywhere. He is an excellent shooter, including from three, and on this team will take take more spot up shots while still being able to utilize his excellent isolation skills when needed.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Kevin Durant: Has the ability to score from anywhere, perhaps better than anyone ever. Will be shooting a lot on this team. He is a walking mismatch, too tall for guards and too fast for bigs. Defensively he has become an excellent player, quick and long enough to match up with guards and tall enough to be a great rim protector.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Kevin Garnett: Incredibly versatile both offensively and defensively. He can finish, has an excellent (and deep) jumpshot, and will serve as the secondary facilitator thanks to his smart playmaking and passing. He is quick and strong enough to defend 1-5, and also a smart field general. Very good rebounder as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Apologies for all of the ""K"" names, but it just turned out that way. 

The plan offensively is for Lebron to bring up the ball, with Garnett being the secondary ball handler. When one is on-ball, the other has the ability space the floor. With Klay, Kawhi, and Durant being excellent shooters, spacing will be incredible. Essentially, everyone can shoot, and all but Klay can easily take it to the rim when they see a lane. 

Defensively, everyone can match up to guards, although Klay and Kawhi will be on them primarily. Everyone can match up to small fowards and most power forwards. Garnett can handle centers, and so can Lebron and Durant situationally. 

I'll go into detail about why I didn't choose some players in the comments. With that said, I'm interested in critiques of this lineup as well as your alternatives.

I know we don’t expect the Hawks to make the playoffs this year and we should be happy with promising development.  But lets just take a look at the possibilities. 


PSA: I’m trying my best to remove my bias.   


I know it is premature to speculate, but the state of the east pre-free agency is weak.  And I think there are only 5 eastern teams currently “locked” into playoffs.

-Bucks
-Raptors (Regardless if Kawhi stays)
-76ers
-Pacers
-Nets (Assuming they land Kyrie or another max FA)



I think there are 5 teams that are going into / staying in “rebuild” mode.  Barring something unexpected in free agency I believe those teams are...

-Wizards
-Cavs
-Knicks
-Heat (With their expiring contracts and owning their 2020 pick I think they go full tank)
-Pistons (I could be wrong, but I think this is the year they decide to go for the rebuild)


That leaves these 4 teams in the remaining for the final 2 spots.

-Celtics
-Magic
-Hornets (Assuming Kemba stays)
-Hawks


Now, can the Hawks be better than 2 of these teams? 


Here is why I am high on the Hawks. I think John Collins has legitimate shot of being an All Star.  In his first year with Trae he nearly averaged 20/10.   Trae has already been working non-stop this offseason.  He has already put on (what looks like) a lot of muscle.  He was trending up last year almost averaging 24/9 after the all-star break.  Our biggest flaw was defense.  Huerter had been showing significant I improvement on defense and drafting Hunter and Cam is an all around upgrade.  I think we have a deep bench (Baze, Bembry, Omari, Crabbe and Vince).  So lets look at the other teams.

 
Celtics:  If they strike out in FA and pivot their goals to developing their 3 rookies they won’t be in the conversation but lets assume they make a play at some B level free agents (i.e. Looney, Brogdon or Middleton).  I think a Celtics team with Tatum, Brown and a couple of B level FA will ultimately have a better record than the Hawks. 

 
Magic:  If they don’t resign Vuc, I don’t think they are making the playoffs.  I know a lot of Magic fans want Vuc to walk to develop Bamba but Vuc was still an all star last year and the best player on the team.  Over time I think Bamba would be able to contribute as much as Vuc but in his first full season he is going to have a learning curve.  Isaacs and AG are both solid pieces but Fultz and Bamba have questions. Okeke was a solid selection but won’t be playing this year.  Unless they resign Vuc I believe the Hawks will have a better record.   
 

Hornets:  This is all dependent on if Kemba is going to stay (which believe he will).   The Hornets are in a rough spot. They don’t have much wiggle room for free agents and so their banking on a couple of their young guys to take the leap.  I think they remain completive but unless Bridges, Monk or P.J. have a breakout season (Which is very possible) they will remain lost in NBA limbo.  At the end of the day it will be very close but I think the Hawks could take the playoff spot from them. 

 
So I think the Final 2 spots are going to be the Celtics and Hawks.  How blinded by my bias am I for thinking this?

He’s a true rim protector and very fluid and he’s fairly new to basketball so there’s no reason to think he can’t grow into his role. Furthermore his skill on the defensive end will allow Zion to almost play free safety on the court and impact the defense in a variety of ways without having to be a primary guy on that end. My question is more related to the offense of the Pelicans as they are currently constructed. 

Zion is obviously going to be the motor of this team, but his shot is his biggest weakness. On paper, the only real shooters or players capable of shooting on the Pelicans are maybe Josh Hart, E’Twan Moore, and maybe Jrue Holiday (but that’s not really what he’s great at - 32.5% last year and 35.5% for his career). 

In the draft they added Jaxson Hayes and Nickeil Alexander-Walker. Hayes did not attempt a 3 pointer last season. NAW shot well from college 3 (38.3% over 2 season) and had a FT% of 76.3% over that same period of time so there is good reason to believe he can develop into a plus NBA shooter.

What I don’t get is why all the NBA talking heads are lauding the Hayes pick as the perfect compliment to Zion. Yes, there will be lobs. Lots, and lots of lobs. But with the inherent lack of shooting on the team, the spacing will be lacking and lanes could get shut down as teams know the rim is where this team will thrive on offense. The main issue with AD in New Orleans was mostly related to a lack of shooting and I don’t see this roster being that much better in that regard.

Is it championships? Is it making the playoffs? Is it having positive attendance numbers? I'm sure the answer to this question is in the eye of the beholder but still, it's an interesting question to ponder. My interest in this question has been especially piqued recently from what I've read on r/NBA. More and more I've seen fans on there leaning towards ""success"" being defined as taking the ""championship or bust"" attitude. Obviously, the Sixers are the prime example of this by taking the ""process"" and tanking until they had enough assets to compete. However, I see many fans question whether the ""process"" failed because they may not win a championship. Even though they were just in the Eastern Conference Finals and to many, this isn't seen as a ""success"" even though it's quite literally the Final Four of the NBA. So this has led me to ask, what's success in the NBA?

Danny Ainge and the Celtics have been a bit under fire lately because Kyrie and Horford are leaving town. They're also losing Rozier for nothing. This has led many fans to criticize Ainge and question how much of a mastermind he is. And while I understand there's more context to it all and they Celtics obviously didn't achieve their goals, are they really failures? They've won 48 or more games the past 4 seasons, been to two ECF, and still have young budding stars and since they didn't win a championship that means they aren't successful? I can get disappointing (especially for this season), but the Celtics have been and are continuing to be one of the best run teams in the league. I don't think success should be entirely defined by a ring or not, that's just not how the world works.

Now I'm willing to admit that my viewpoint may be biased because I'm a Pacers fan, so I'm a fan of a very well run organization who hasn't won an NBA championship. My fandom is completely built around a team that has been successful in just about every way except winning it all. And I totally understand the urge to win it all and how hard it is to have never had that experience. I want the Pacers to win a championship as bad as anybody. However, I'd never give back the years where we had very good teams who didn't make it all the way. Some of my favorite Pacer teams where the scrappy ones who made life hard in the playoffs. I love that the Pacers fight to stay competitive even if they aren't in position to win it all. It makes fandom fun and I believe being a fan of an NBA team is more than just hoping we win a championship, it's about following the players journey, the coaches, the moments, and just the journey along the way. Yeah, winning it all is the ultimate experience, but there are so many more great experiences along the way that make being a fan of the NBA worth it.

And just to be clear, this isn't a ""tanking should never happen"" type post. I understand that there can be a time and place where a team can just go young and take the Ls. However, I just think a season can be considered a ""success"" without a championship or even a shot at it. A team can be entertaining even with no chance. I personally think too many people get caught up in the allure of championships that they forget to enjoy what's right in front of them.

&amp;#x200B;

In the MJ vs LBJ GOAT debate:

People who think that Jordan is better than James, they usually refer to the 6-0 record of Jordan pointing to James's 3-6.People who think that James is better than Jordan, they usually refer to the 9 finals appearances of James pointing to Jordan's 1-9 record in the playoffs (without Scottie Pippen).

&amp;#x200B;

The webpage focuses on disputing Jordan's 6-0 finals record and James' 9 finals appearances.

Basically, they used a statistic (which i don't know how reliable is) that calculates MJ's teams' rating vs their opponent teams' rating in the playoffs and finals in different years. They did the same with LBJ's teams and opponent teams.Higher rating = higher chances of winning

&amp;#x200B;

And the results are:

&amp;#x200B;

Michael Jordan's 1-9 playoff record is proven underrated because in these match ups, the opposing teams' ratings are mostly higher than MJ's teams.However, Michael Jordan's 6 for 6 record in the finals is proven overrated because in these match ups, the opposing teams' ratings are mostly lower than MJ's teams.

LeBron James' 9 finals appearances is proven overrated because (as we commonly know, the east in his time is not that powerful) the opposing teams' ratings are mostly lower than LBJ's teams.However, LeBron James 3-6 record in the finals is proven underrated because in these match ups, the opposing teams' ratings are mostly higher than LBJ's teams. If my memory serves me right, it also says that there's only 2 times when LeBron's team rating is higher than the opponent's team rating: Which is the 2011 Dallas Mavericks and 2012 Oklahoma City Thunder.

&amp;#x200B;

One last thing i remember written about it is in (finals') comparison, all the teams that Michael Jordan has ever faced in the finals is all weaker than the weakest team LeBron James has ever faced in the finals.

This whole observation is focused more on MJ and LBJ's respective teams rather than solely MJ and LBJ.

As many people would know by know the Jazz have acquired Mike Conley from the Memphis Grizzlies and look set to be able to challenge for a high playoff seed in the West this coming season. A commonly known fact by most people too is that Conley has never made an all-star game and many people would argue he is the best player to never have made an all star team. With this the case it made me curious as to which 3 players in NBA history have played together in a season and had 0 all star appearances.  
  
Now I haven't done a whole lot of research but I think Utah look pretty good.  
  
- **Mike Conley** averaged 21/3/6 last season on 44/36/85 shooting splits. Conley at his best was also arguably the best player on three 50 win teams. He was an elite defender at the guard position and a solid all around player.  
  
- **Rudy Gobert** averaged 16/13/2 last season on 67/-/64 shooting splits. Gobert at his best was also arguably the best player on three 50 win teams and is also in the running for his second DPOY after his second all-NBA team appearance too.  
  
- **Donovan Mitchell** averaged 24/4/4 last season on 43/36/81 shooting splits. Mitchell is also only in just his second season and has already been the number one option on back to back top 5 seeded teams. Another fun fact is that Mitchell has the highest career scoring average of all 0 time all stars in NBA history.

My question is more along the lines of if you dropped 1962 Russell into today's game, or took 2017 Anthony Davis and put him in the 60s, who would be better? It becomes more of a debate. Build your list based on a players sustained peak. Similar to Bill Simmons wine cellar team.

Obviously this 30 all time greatest list will skew heavily towards modern players. That is just the way it works, in general today's players are bigger, stronger, faster, more athletic and more skilled than prior generations of players. There are all time greats that I think would still be dominant against current players though. But how many? 

For me this is how it breaks down.

1. M. Jordan

Last time there wasn't a single comment that wasn't either about how it's not fair to compare Luka to Lebron since Luka played as a pro in Europe, or how I have an agenda because I copied over the 92 clutch FTA column instead of the 99 PTS, or how I missed his 3 heaves -- or how I gave him an extra .4%TS, or how I didn't include winshares even though Luka generated almost 25% more WS/48, how nice of me considering I'm cherrypicking stats that make him look bad

Peja led the Euroleague in scoring before he came over. He didn't win Rookie of the Year. This is r/nbadiscussion, and this post is about an about NBA rookie. Saying that it's not fair to compare them because Luka was the triple MVP in Europe at 18 is saying that it's not fair to compare Lebron to a superior player.

---------------------------------------------------------------

This seems to be an unpopular opinion, but I don't see how it's possible for anyone who saw them both play to think otherwise. So let's look at the numbers.

Rookie Lebron put up 21/6/6 and Rookie Luka put up 21/8/6. Seems close but Lebron averaged 40 minutes a game and Luka 32 - Luka didn't play 40 minutes even once.

Luka was more efficient, 54%TS vs 49%TS, and even so compared to league average efficiency -1.5% vs -2.8%.

Luka has a small quirk in his stats though - he hunted end of quarter heaves. No one in the league took more ""back court shots"" than him (15), not even Steph (11). If we discount 40 footers, his 3P% improves from .327 to .335, and his TS from .545 to .551 (-.9% league average). Lebron took 3 heaves, discounting which would have improved his 3P% to .294 and TS% to .489 (-2.4%).

Luka shot better than Lebron from everywhere on the court - yes, even at the basket - except the free throw line.

Per 100 possessions, Luka put up 32/12/9 to Lebron's 28/7/8. Rookie Luka's numbers are actually closer to Sophomore Lebron (34/9/9) than to Rookie Lebron.

To the best of my knowledge BPM is the only advanced stat that goes that far back and it had Luka (4.1) at #21 and Lebron (1.9) at #48. If you consider winshares an advanced stat, Luka generated .101 WS/48 to Lebron's .078.

Rookie Lebron scored 99 clutch points (18th in league) on 37%FG with 11 assists on 13 turnovers; in 7 less games, Rookie Luka was 10th in the league in clutch scoring with 120 points on 45%FG, to go with 23 assists on 10 turnovers. Sophomore Lebron scored 88 clutch points on 39%FG with 20 assists on 13 turnovers.

That Luka was a better basketball player than Lebron in their first year shouldn't really be any surprise to anyone considering that Luka already played multiple seasons of professional basketball in Europe (and was triple MVP) and Lebron was in high school playing against children who couldn't even take a sponsorship.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,52046,public,self,Luka was better as an NBA rookie than Lebron,0,1561453716,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/c4b11m/luka_was_better_as_an_nba_rookie_than_lebron/,,,,,,,,,,,,

To the best of my knowledge BPM is the only advanced stat that goes that far back and it had Luka (4.1) at #21 and Lebron (1.9) at #48.

Rookie Lebron scored 92 clutch points (18th in league) on 37%FG with 11 assists on 13 turnovers; in 7 less games, Rookie Luka was 10th in the league in [clutch](https://streamable.com/108i9) scoring with 120 points on 45%FG, to go with 23 assists on 10 turnovers. Sophomore Lebron scored 88 clutch points on 39%FG with 20 assists on 13 turnovers.

IMO, this is the perfect combination of dominance offensively as each player can maximize their skillets while coexisting with their teammates. LeBron can run the show as the PG and set Jordan up for 1 on 1's, Klay is always ready to shoot 3s off the dish, Rodman doesn't even need the ball, and Shaq is Shaq. Defensively thus team is an absolute nightmare as well. LeBron doesn't play much defense these days but in Miami he was an absolute monster and was legitimately playing great defense on 1-4(PG-PF) on a nightly basis. Klay and Jordan are elite wing defenders. Rodman is one of the best all around defenders ever(post and wing). It'd he hard to imagine anyone being able to get consistent penetration against Rodman and Shaq, let alone even getting past a backcourt that consists of Klay/Jordan/LeBron.

I don't really hold truck with such nonsense but I thought it'd be cool to find a way to statistically approximate the relative strength of championship teams that takes into account their performance the teams they actually faced along the way, which, due to factors including trades and injuries, may differ from their regular season selves.

Raw point differential cannot be the answer, because it does not take into account the quality of opponents, and even SRS would be problematic to calculate for the playoffs, as not all teams play one another.

[Fortunately Daniel Myers, in the course of inventing Box Plus-Minus, chanced upon a solution:](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/bpm.html)

&gt;The playoff team efficiency, which is used in the team adjustment portion of the BPM calculation, is derived as follows:  
&gt;  
&gt;Use playoff minutes distribution for each team along with each player's regular season BPM value to generate a ""playoff team strength."" In general, playoff rotations are shortened, so teams are stronger than in the regular season. If a player had fewer than 200 minutes of regular season play on the given team, they were assumed to be replacement level for this calculation.  
&gt;  
&gt;Count games played against each opponent in the playoffs.  
&gt;  
&gt;Strength of Schedule is the average opponent team rating for the duration of the playoffs.  
&gt;  
&gt;Add actual playoff efficiency differential to the calculated strength of schedule to get the adjusted team efficiency differential used in the BPM calculation.  
&gt;  
&gt;As an example, in 2013-2014 San Antonio won the title. They went through 7 games of Dallas (derived strength +4.1), 5 games of Portland (+6.5), 6 games of Oklahoma City (+10.5), and 5 games of Miami (+6.9), so their average strength of schedule was +6.9. Their raw efficiency differential was +10.0 in the playoffs, so their overall adjusted efficiency differential was a spectacular +16.9. That is the same scale as regular season efficiency differential–the Spurs were really dominant.  
&gt;  
&gt;(This is reminiscent of [Hollinger's playoff ratings](http://espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2012/story/_/page/greatestruns-1-5/nba-playoffs-ranking-greatest-runs). The 2001 Lakers had a playoff adjusted efficiency differential of +20.4 by this method.)

Whatever problems BPM may have for measuring individual players, at a team level it is forced to sum to schedule-adjusted efficiency differential. For this method to be significantly inaccurate, a champion would have had to have faced multiple teams where a player who is particularly over- or under-rated by BPM was injured. Without further ado:

# Notes:

* The average champion posted a mark of +12.7 (+6.8 on offence and +5.9 on defence)
* I would tend to trust the overall results more than the defence/offence splits -  see the bizarre finding that the 2004 Pistons were better offensively than defensively)
* The 16-1 Warriors fall short of not only the 2001 Lakers but also MJ's two best teams

Going back to the 2019 mock drafts, set before draft day, Justin James was not projected to be drafted in a single mock. No media seemed to talk about him and no analysts reviewed him. So when my team drafted him with the first pick they owned in the draft, I was skeptical. Now, however, I have since done my own research and watched film, and am very eager to see this kid on the court. He may bust, or he may be a steal. I will say, the potential is obvious.

Can anybody give me some examples where this has happened before? What players were not recognized by the draft analysis community, and then go on to get drafted? Ideally, and then succeed? Or maybe they failed? The more samples the better.

Darius Garland was a highly recruited player out of Tennessee. He was rated 17 by Rivals, 11 by 247 Sports, and 16 by ESPN. As we all know, Garland only played 5 games in college (with the best opponent being Liberty) before going down with his meniscus injury. Reportedly, he left the combine early due to being promised to be picked up by a lottery team.

Romeo Langford was also highly recruited and one of the best prospects to come out of Indiana in a while. He was rated 6 by Rivals, 5 by 247 Sports, and 5 by ESPN. He had a torn ligament in the thumb of his shooting hand, and played the final 26 games of the season with said injury. While his shooting from three was still subpar pre-injury, he was shooting 52% from the field before the injury.

If KD didn’t join GSW to win two titles, would people still hold him in such high regard? It’s not difficult for a superstar to look good when surrounded by so much other talent.

KD is playing with the two greatest shooters of all time, one of whom is a top 15 player ever, an arguably current top 15 player in draymond, and a former all nba 2nd team player in boogie, all in their primes. 

Harden plays with an old CP3 who at this point I’m not sure if he’s even better than Kyle Lowry, Eric Gordon and Capela who aren’t better than any of GSW’s starters imo. Houston isn’t exactly a one man show but Harden is clearly the lone superstar while GSW arguably has 3. 

People seem to have an unfair standard for Harden. He gets shit on because he keeps losing to GSW, but why should that be held against him? How is that anything to be ashamed of? In fact, Harden is the only one who has even come close to beating a healthy KD GSW squad. Lebron who imo is the 2nd greatest of all time, went 1-8 against them, Kawhi beat them without KD, with Klay gone 1.5 games, and injuries to Iguodala and their bench.  

The rockets went 7 games last year with CP3 out 3 games, and this year was still very competitive all series. Every single game was within 6 points. Chris paul also played like garbage outside of game 6. Do people even realize Harden averaged 35-7-6 on 46% shooting for the series? Hardly a “choke” as many casual viewers would say.

The three most common explanations were - 1) Great Legacy of titles, 2) Great Market in terms of marketing and opportunity, 3) Great Weather and lots of celebrities.

&amp;#x200B;

As I mentioned in that post, all three alone are insufficient to explain this as you can come up with or two or three teams that satisfy these criteria and they still lack the exceptionalism the lakers do.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the replies suggested its the combination of all three that's the reason and while that's definitely possible, I think there's another reason and it relates to why this doesn't show up in other sports: The max salary.

&amp;#x200B;

The NFL has a hard cap, the nba has a soft cap - but the difference here is if an NFL team wants to pay Tom Brady 99 percent of the salary cap and fill out the rest of the roster with guys off the street, it can(yes I know there's a veteran minimum so they can't literally spend 99 percent of the cap, but you get the idea).

&amp;#x200B;

In the NBA, AD turns down the supermax for a 4 year max instead, giving up around 30 million dollars. While 30 million sounds like enough, the reality is he probably made a decision that 30 million is worth giving up in exchange for more marketing opportunities and better lifestyle. However, if all of a sudden the pelicans could pay AD as much as he wanted and let's say New Orleans were willing - then I don't think he leaves New Orleans. They might offer a 10 year contract paying 60 million a year which the Lakers with Lebron could not. Does AD really turn down that much money? Not saying the Pelicans would or should, but suddenly it becomes a negotiation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I'm wrong - In the NFL, players are more likely to take the money because careers are shorter and non guaranteed and the franchise tag limits player movement further, but I'm curious what people think would happen to lakers exceptionalism if there were no max contracts.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,51727,public,self,Alternative Explanation to Lakers Exceptionalism,0,1561309199,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/c3s2mb/alternative_explanation_to_lakers_exceptionalism/,,,,,,,,,,,,

Please leave suggestions if it seems like I'm ripping a certain team off, I don't know much about valuing draft picks, cap space etc.

&gt;**Minnesota receives:**

&gt;D'Angelo Russell (sign and trade)

&gt;Chandler Parsons

&gt;**Brooklyn receives:**

&gt;**Memphis receives:**

&gt;Andrew Wiggins

&gt;Jeff Teague

&gt;Taurean Prince

&gt;Keita Bates-Diop

&gt;2021 Minnesota 1st round pick

Minnesota would do this trade because, obviously, it gets them D'Angelo Russell, but also because it's a chance to dump Wiggins' contract.

Brooklyn in this scenario is planning on signing Kyrie + another max FA, so they get what value they can from a D'Angelo S&amp;T while freeing up cap space (assuming they go after Durant, they would need about ~$71 million for him and Kyrie, [according to these projections.](https://www.hoopsrumors.com/2018/07/early-maximum-salary-projections-for-201920.html)) I think this trade would free up enough space for them if they also renounce all cap holds and waive Treveon Graham.

Memphis does this trade to gather assets. They will probably be in the lottery these next few years anyway, so it doesn't hurt them as much to pay for Wiggins (and who knows, maybe a change of scenery will do him good, but I doubt it. Either way, if they want to get rid of him a couple years after, his contract won't be as hard to trade with fewer years remaining on it). It also gives them Teague (who is only signed for one more season and can serve as a veteran presence for Ja). I might be underestimating how bad Wiggins' contract is, so they might need a little more to take it on; maybe replace Bates-Diop with Josh Okogie, or the Nets could also send Kurucs, or Minnesota could add another pick.

- - - - -

The Utah Jazz entered the second round of Thursday night’s NBA draft with a single pick. They left with a versatile forward who admires P.J. Tucker’s game, a guard who can score from anywhere, and a wing with 3-and-D potential.

Charleston forward Jarrell Brantley (No. 50), Hofstra guard Justin Wright-Foreman (No. 53), and Yale wing Miye Oni (No. 58) each has work to do in his transition to the NBA. But general manager Justin Zanik was certainly pleased with the team’s additions Thursday.

“We’re really excited to have them,” Zanik said. “They fit what we’re looking for in Jazz players, now and going forward.”

• Brantley (6-7, 250 pounds) averaged 19.4 points and 8.4 rebounds per game last season. The forward had generated buzz after a strong showing at the Portsmouth Invitational and had been rising up draft boards in recent days. Brantley has pointed to Draymond Green, PJ Tucker and Marcus Morris as current players he has tried to model his game after.

• Wright-Foreman (6-2, 190 pounds) was a dynamic scorer for Hofstra, who averaged 27.1 points per game last season.

• Oni was the Ivy League’s player of the year in back to back seasons. Last year, his junior campaign, he averaged 17.1 points per game for the Bulldogs. A 6-foot-6 wing with a 6-11 wingspan, Oni shot 37.1 percent from beyond the arc last season on 5.2 attempts per game.

- - - - - 

Zanik spoke with reporters at the conclusion of the draft:

**What stood out from Jarrell Brantley’s workout here?**

“Great energy on the court. He’s coming from a smaller conference, but you see a guy that can dominate at times. He was the best player for his team, on a pretty good tea. [During his workout in Salt Lake] we got to see how he interacts with teammates. We had a lot of high-level players there and he fit right in. His physical attributes and motor and some developing skills are things we think we can harness.”

**What role can Justin Wright-Foreman play?**

“He can score at all three levels. He had to have a big load [in college]. As he transitions to the NBA, that’s not the role that’s going to be available to him early. If he can grow into that, great. But he can make shots. He can make open shots. He can create shots for himself. Anytime you can acquire those type of qualities—whether it’s a guard, wing, big— you want to go after them. … Every guy that comes into the league needs to work on things. They’re not fully formed players. It’s a role shift. How do you adapt? His open shot making, and quickness. He’s very secure with the ball in his hands. However Coach wants to use him, that’s a good start.” 

**What stood out about Miye Oni when you watched him and interviewed him at the NBA Combine?**

“What we like is his defensive ability, even though he was a main scorer at Yale. His open shooting making, being able to contest shots and use his length. I think he can develop. A defender at first and an open shot maker as he develops.”

**All three of these players come from smaller conferences. Does that matter?**

“Whenever you move up a level, there’s always a transition. If you work hard and you have a skillset, you have a game that translates, we have a coaching staff that can develop you. … There’s a saying that if you play in college and you’re good enough, the NBA will find you. These guys were all known commodities. They’ve all had successful careers. It wasn’t something that they just came onto the radar. Maybe on a public level or media level. But from a scouting level, we’ve known about these guys for a while.”

**All three of these players had multiple years of college experience. How important was that for you?**

“It wasn’t that these guys had to play four years in college. It was more that their games became more mature, so we saw that each one of them had—while all needing developing in their transition to the NBA—these skillsets that we saw that could translate. Now, how much? How long? There’s a chance that we can have a lot of roster flexibility going forward and we will continue to be aggressive in free agency with that coming up. But these guys give us a chance to develop. Hopefully they’ll all play in summer league and be with our program going forward.”

**How do you see these players fitting into the roster?**

“With our roster—and we’ll continue to be aggressive—it’s open. There’s a chance that we open a lot of roster spots. What we tell our guys is come in, compete, and we’ll have a developmental path for you. That could be a number of ways. That could be on the roster, the G-League, two-way contracts. Any of those things are on the table. Let’s get you in here, let’s get our coaching staff around you, have a good summer and play and we’ll work with them to figure out the best development path.”",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,51548,public,self,"Aaron Falk's article ""Utah Jazz add scoring, defense and depth with a trio of second-round draft picks""",0,1561261386,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/c3cqew/aaron_falks_article_utah_jazz_add_scoring_defense/,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '3pY0FXlJ1yc7vIaeF8jpO_kJ5VZ7sWe3Nnh7OH--h30', 'resolutions': [{'height': 77, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/A_V-3cgLlxAL80wMNSG6ayQIjqMdDCkMg_u2FMBelEs.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b9c8f4738d54475b3148067fd1d44dd1e8c2ef8', 'width': 108}, {'height': 154, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/A_V-3cgLlxAL80wMNSG6ayQIjqMdDCkMg_u2FMBelEs.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=499704d3218e427b56cc4c1472430b9b67137304', 'width': 216}, {'height': 228, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/A_V-3cgLlxAL80wMNSG6ayQIjqMdDCkMg_u2FMBelEs.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1de4b884952f874ba666f703ed9a3380e27834d0', 'width': 320}, {'height': 457, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/A_V-3cgLlxAL80wMNSG6ayQIjqMdDCkMg_u2FMBelEs.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48f076881c0bcce9471c5a29e05c442ede30e79e', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 500, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/A_V-3cgLlxAL80wMNSG6ayQIjqMdDCkMg_u2FMBelEs.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=fb68bb8c614a5a316182f95688a43738ac94d837', 'width': 700}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,

At that time, Bol Bol, big man who was protected to go in the lottery/late 1st, was still available and it would be totally understandable if they selected him based on the hype.

Instead, they trade the pick to Miami for the 45th and 2 extra second-rounders in future drafts. Then, Dallas selected the 6'8"" Foward Isaiah Roby. And he fits the new philosophy for acquring prospects they now have.

Isaiah is really athletic and he has good lenght (7'3"" wingspan). He is a decent cutter and finisher, and was also somewhat OK shooting 3s. The thing I like the most is his versatility. He is really quick and tall, which means he can guard positions 1-4 and can switch in the PnR without providing a mismatch for the opponents. That's where the Mavs liked him.

Last year, Nelson and Cuban selected Kostas and Spalding with the 56th and 60th picks in the draft. They didn't necessarily pan out, as Kostas never stepped in a NBA court and Spalding was cut late in the season. But their main attributes were lenght, versatility on defense, quickness and athleticism. The same ones that made Roby a maverick. 

They also got Dorian Finney-Smith and Maxi Kleber in free agency before the 2018 season, and they both had a really good season. What are their main strengths, you ask? Lenght, versatility on defense, quickness for their positions and athleticism. 

Kleber is a terrific rim protector, mainly due to his vertical leap. He also is decent when guarding faster players, which allows him to be able to play with any type of big man (he played a lot of minutes with Dirk and Jordan).

DFS is also a really good perimeter defender. He has a really good wingspan, is able to stay in front of his man regardless of his position, and can guard 1-4.

Jackson Jr. is the perfect blueprint for a modern day NBA center: quick, very versatile defensively with great defensive instinct, as well as the great ability to stretch the floor.

Couple Jackson up with another defensively player in Clarke and you have a foundation for one of the most potential filled frontcourts. Clarke  is extremely versatile and can even guard 1/2 to 4. He's an excellent slasher and while he lacks in shooting, I think he'll definitely improve with time.

Not to mention that Ja Morant will be orchestrating the pick and roll, pick and pop game with Clarke and Jackson Jr., I imagine Clarke rolling and Jackson Jr. stretching the floor along with Ja Morant and 2 other wings will be their long term foundation for the team. Right now this seems like the Grizzlies' rebuild will be somewhat short.

An example that immediately comes to mind is Khris Middleton.  In an NBA world where signing Khris Middleton to a 4 year max deal means you no longer have the cap space to pursue a Kawhi Leonard, am I crazy to think that, were I an NBA GM, I wouldn't touch Middleton with a 10 foot pole for that kind of money? (Coming from a guy who has been saying Middleton should be in the mix for all Star team talks for the past couple years).  Are teams just resigning to the idea that they don't think they can pull in these franchise changing players with their available cap space and so are signing the next best thing. Am I crazy to think the next best thing, e.g. Middleton should be getting paid somewhat less than a max deal?

Throughout the playoffs I believe that not only Kawhi paved the way for leading your own team to a championship, but so has Damian Lillard. For Years people thought Damian was crazy and not progressive nor smart for wanting to stay where he was drafted. Lillard has always preached loyalty, and I believe it is starting to take shape around the league. Kawhi has shown everyone how astonishing it is to lead your own team to a championship, especially if that team you’re leading doesn’t have a single lottery pick on the roster. Hopefully young stars will follow in these players footsteps and value the creation and grueling process it takes to lead your franchise to a title. Now, I am not rooting for an extinction of super teams. In fact, super teams have always been in existence! Wether it was the showtime Lakers or the Hakeem led rockets, they have always been around and we secretly don’t hate super teams as much as we think we do. However, recently they have become almost manufactured. It seemed with the Warriors that it became excessive, it became too much. I feel there is a limit for the amount of transcendent talents on one team. Four is a bit much if you ask me. The new odium of super teams is also the effect of the enablement of player mobility. Which is a positive thing, players should be able to take their talents wherever they desire! Even if it’s to South Beach! I do think the NBA will shift back to normal, the pendulum will swing to where it is suppose to be. More players will eye the allusive title without a teaming of multiple superstars to get the job done. This is really just an example of all things in life. We are experiencing an imbalanced way of basketball that will soon shift back to normal. Give credit where credit is due however, especially to Dame, Kawhi, and the team up north.

Basically said Kyrie is set on Brooklyn, and is trying to recruit KD, but said he isn’t going to make a decision based on anyone else. Says Warriors, Nets, Knicks, and Clippers are the main suitors for him. 

To me, that gives the Knicks a lot of hope. Making an independent decision means making it for yourself. That to me doesn’t signal taking a Supermax from GSW and sticking around. It doesn’t mean teaming up in Brooklyn just because Kyrie will be around. Going to the Knicks who have the least attractive situation of the four teams would be a total independent move on KD’s part. He signs the four year max, gets to rehab for a year with no pressure, and return in 2020 to push them in the Eastern Conference. The addition of Barrett might also be attractive to him as well.

- Ended up using some of that cap space in Aron Baynes 


-Trade pick number 6 rather than using it to get a point guard that you desperately need (Coby White) for pick number 11


-Use number 11 on a player that easily could’ve been available at early 20s region and still not draft a point guard


-End up trading for a point guard but at sacrificing your cap space in the process rather than look to sign one. (Possibly Russell)


The suns traded a good TJ Warren for Aron Baynes and a point guard that wasn’t Coby White.
