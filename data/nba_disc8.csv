A lack of experience or chemistry for LeBron led teams have never been an issue for him in the postseason. In 2010-2011 It was LeBron’s first year with his South Beach squad and although they didn’t win the finals that year, they still made it there, but their loss was obviously not due to a lack of chemistry. When LeBron came back to Cleveland in the 2014-2015 season experience or chemistry again proved to not be an issue as he took his team to the finals, but lost in 6 because of injuries to Irving and Love. This year I don’t see it going any differently with him teaming up with one of the most transcendent bigs of all time in Anthony Davis. The biggest concern in most people’s eyes is the Lakers lack of cap space for this summer as they only have 23.7 million dollars. I don’t see this being a problem. The Lakers will choose to facilitate this money amongst many players that will complement LeBron and Davis. Maybe a sharpshooter like JJ redick or a hard working point guard like Patrick Beverley. Who knows what the Lakers will do with their money, but all I know is that it will be money well spent. And, in the west who else poses as a big threat? In my mind it would be a 47 win Clippers team adding the leagues finals MVP Kawhi Leonard. Another team that will be a challenge for the lake show will be the young Denver Nuggets squad that will only get better.

Anyhow, the prevailing wisdom - and I guess the eyetest suggests as well - seems to be that Kemba is the 2nd best 1 this year and Russell a distant 3rd, with many questioning if he is even worth a max - I was surprised to see that the numbers aren't so clear cut. 

The stuff that's set in stone is that Russell is much bigger - he has 4 inches on him in height and 6 inches in wingspan - and that he's 6 years younger.

[Through 4 seasons](http://bkref.com/tiny/VBD2Y) their stats are as close as they can get, with Russell actually being the more efficient player, but lagging in the advanced stats. Can anyone pull those RAPM numbers? 

[This last year](http://bkref.com/tiny/ad2U1) they aren't as far apart as I thought they would be either - Kemba gets 4 more points and 1 more assist in 5 more minutes and 2 shots, on slightly better efficiency. BPM actually has Russell slightly ahead, but RPM and PIPM put Kemba comfortably in front.

The only thing that really sticks out is that Kemba has always been much better from the line, which does seem to have correlation to how good of a shooting career someone will have more often than not. Kemba is also much better at getting to the line, with Russell being pretty allergic to it. 

Looks pretty close all in all, but Kemba being 28 he's almost certainly at his peak or very near to it, and with Russell only 22, not only will Russell have a much cheaper contract but will probably have more trade value down the road.

Russell seems like he should be the more coveted player, except maybe in some extreme win-now cases like the Lakers.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,51327,public,self,Is Kemba really more valuable than D'Angelo?,0,1561255289,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/c30guw/is_kemba_really_more_valuable_than_dangelo/,,,,,,,,,,

His team had lost player after player, and Collin Sexton had to lead his team 3 on 5 ([not a typo](https://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/2017/11/25/16700182/alabama-three-players-score-stats-basketball-minnesota)). He showed heart and the game was close, but that's far from what someone expects as the signature moment for a top lottery pick, especially for one traded in exchange for Kyrie Irving. His reputation was that he couldn't shoot, but he could drive to the hoop and dunk. He was undersized but played with heart. He was an aggressive on-ball defender, but he was going to have a comparably smaller frame in the NBA. Some thought he would be a DeRozan type player.

Few of the predictions held true. He began the season with abysmal efficiency from everywhere. He had a hard time cracking the starting rotation on a team with no expectations. The game seemed too fast for him, he couldn't shoot, and he seemed too weak at the rim and on defense to warrant any more playing time. Things began to change, however. 10 games in he was finally getting some starting time, but more importantly the 3 began to fall. Nobody expected it, but it was one of the most consistent parts of his game all year.

Games Segment|Pts|Reb|Ast|Fg(M-A)|TS|3PM-A|3P%|FTM-A|FT%
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
1-41|14.6|3|2.8|5.8-13.7|49.2|.8-2.1|39.1|2.3-2.6|87
42-61|15.6|3.3|3.1|5.6-14.9|47.8|1.8-4.4|39.8|2.7-3.3|81.5
62-82|21.9|2.3|3.2|8.1-16.5|60.1|2.4-5.8|41.3|3.2-3.9|81.7

It's easy to see a couple positive patterns emerge.

1. His 3P% was good all year, but it and volume went up over the course of it. He actually shot 41% from 3 on the season as a starter. 72 games is not a small sample size. Klay Thompson shot 40% last year

2. His FT% was great all year as well, but he it took him time to draw FTs. ~4 is okay, it's in the Jrue Holiday range, good for 41st in the league last year. 3.2 FTM is slightly better, putting him between Holiday and Kyrie Irving.

His overall efficiency skyrocketed. How, and is it something we can expect to continue? Let's look at his shot selection and how it improved:

Games Segment|Restricted Area FGM-A (FG%)|Paint (Non-RA) FGM-A (FG%)|Mid-Range FGM-A (FG%)|3PM-A (3P%)
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
1-41|76-153 (49.7%)|18-64 (28.1%)|108-258 (41.9%)|34-87 (39%)
42-61|46-90 (51.1%)|17-58 (29.3%)|14-63 (22.2%)|35-87 (40%)
62-82|72-118 (61%)|26-59 (44.1%)|23-49 (46.9%)|50-120 (41.6%)

So it's pretty easy to see how his efficiency improved. **His mid range attempts went from 6.3 pg to 2.3 pg while his 3 went from 2.1 to 5.8**. Yes, he also began shooting much better in the restricted area, but I believe it was another example of better shot selection. He is not afraid of contact, but that only works if you can draw FTs or finish through contact. He went form getting blocked to making shots and drawing fouls. At the beginning of the year it seemed like he made a decision on the perimeter and then followed through no matter what. By the end of the season the game slowed down; he could adjust on the way to the rim. 

For defense, it's definitely his biggest weakness. As the season went on, you could see the game was slowing down for him. He started to react faster to what was going on around him instead of getting lost or blown by. One game that stood out to me was the match up with Stephen Curry towards the end of the season. Sexton absolutely harassed Curry all night long. He showed that he has the potential to be the obnoxious on ball defender he showed himself in college. It's not clear he will do it on a day in day out basis, but he has potential. I think he could be like Kemba Walker - someone who is not a great defender, but typically underrated defensively and far from poor. [Here's the highlights from that game.](https://youtu.be/KrC8MAZfQMg)

Running the offense is his second biggest weakness. He's a willing passer, but he does not pass in a manner that runs an offense. He is not directing traffic or setting people up in the flow of an organized offense. Towards the end of the season he showed he can improvise on the fly and develop a solid drive and kick game. Cavs will have to find some shooting for that to go anywhere. Much of the season the team had 0 shooting of any kind, so the assists could realistically come from lobs. Unfortunately that meant TT had to catch something. Either way it's not a huge concern to me, many many PGs come into the league with a similar number of assists and quickly achieve 6+ assists by their 2nd or 3rd year.

**TL;DR**

Sexton's offensive efficiency skyrocketed over the course of the year: 49% TS in the first 41 games, 54% TS in 2019 and 60% TS over the last 20 games. It was in large part due to consistent 3PT shooting and better shot selection. His defense showed glimmers of hope.

First of all, RFA is abominable. It doesn't give players any official way out from the teams unless they're traded or cut. Mostly good players tend to sign the rookie extension but what if they want to leave before? They'll have to ask for a trade in the future which usually is acrimonious for everyone involved.

On the other hand if NBA decides to abolish the draft what will happen to players who would be picked around 40th-60th picks. At best they'd follow the route of Van Vleet and other undrafted free agents who made it through. At worst they'd end up in some backwater league or retire from basketball. Even if 2nd round picks don't get guaranteed contracts like 1st rounders, it's still better than nothing.

If the Pacers had a starting lineup of D’Angelo Russell, Oladipo, T.J. Warren, Thad, and Myles would that be enough to make them legit contenders?

I went on basketball reference and went through each and every game that he played in that was close, and looked at his shooting stats in the last 3 minutes. I considered a close game would be a game that ended in 7 points or less. There were 37 games he played in that ended up close scores.

In 37 close playoff games, Stephen Curry has a record of 23-14

Shooting 44/106 (41.5%) in the final 3 minutes of games resulting within 7 points

With 114 points off 106 field goal attempts

12 Turnovers

3/11 On go ahead or game winning attempts (shots within the last 24 seconds)

27.45 PPG/ 7.1 AST/ 3.3 TOV/ 41 MIN/ 42.8 FG%/ 7-4 Record

Most Clutch shot attempts- Score shows score at time of shot, not final score

Game 1 2013 First round- 14.5 seconds left hits game tying 3 95-95 vs Denver

Game 2 2015 NBA Finals- 8 seconds left, makes 2 pt shot, tie game 87-87

Overtime- 7 seconds left, misses 2 pt down by 1,  Cleveland ins 94-93 

Game 7 2016 NBA Finals- 31 seconds left, misses 3 pt down by 3 - 92-89 Cleveland

Game 1 2018 NBA finals- makes 2 pt shot with 23 seconds left- Tie game 106-106

Game 4 2019 Second Round vs Houston- misses 3 pt with 3 seconds left 111-108 Houston

Since it seems many people have a poor understanding of filters and thresholds and conflate finding meaningful comparisons with cherrypicking, the filters are explained by:

3PT Era - no particular reason, I always use this. I think the game changed drastically since then and no one would know who the 2 additional guys are anyway

MP - the other option here is to use MPG, but MP weeds out players whose teams were destroyed in the 1st round

FGA - weeds out players that don't take a lot of shots to get some meaning out of the true shooting metric

The thresholds for the filters were set with ample buffer above/below Barton's numbers.

So Memphis gets Allen, Crowder and Korver plus the #23 pick this year and a future first rounder.  

Allen and Crowder should stick with Memphis and we'll have to see if Memphis decides to move Korver or not.  Crowder probably gets an early nod in the starting lineup although he's more built for coming off the bench and Dillon Brooks / Kyle Anderson figure to be in the starter discussion as well.    The Grizzly guard situation is really in flux and we'll have to see if Avery Bradley is brought back.  I suspect he will be and figures to start as well and could be moved later in the season.  If he's not brought back the door is probably open for Allen, Holiday (if re-signed) or Tyler Dorsey at SG.  We'll have to see if JV is re-signed or not at this point.

Two top tier guys who can be the best players on a championship team. The best part is that free agency hasn’t even begun. They will most likely land another star, wether it be Kemba, Kyrie, Butler, or Beal. In addition to landing a third star the Lakers still need key pieces, especially experienced veterans to complement this roster. Because as of now the Lakers only have an astonishing 5 guys under contract for the 2019-2020. Those guys under contract are LeBron, Kuz, AD, Moritz Wagner, and Isaac bongo... That’s definitely a red flag. If they can land a third star and sign other key free agents then without a doubt the Lakers will have the most star studded roster in all of the league. Next year the hierarchy in the west will be dramatically shifted. The warriors will have no KD and maybe no Klay, depending on the severity of his injury. And, I firmly believe a Kawhi led clippers team will not be able to stand straight up against this laker team. Maybe the Blazers could put something together to challenge LeBron’s Lakers, but judging it off of their roster as of right now I can’t foresee that happening. So, who else does that leave in the west? The next real threat for the Lakers to me is the Denver Nuggets. Yes they are young, but they had a great run in the post season and gained valuable experience while showing every doubter that Jokic is a star in the league. Murray is a great young player as well who went toe to toe with star point guard Damian Lillard. But, even the Nuggets I don’t believe will show to be a big enough threat to the Lakers. So, if the west can’t hang with the Lakers then who will be able to in the east? The Bucks? Who knows how free agency will change things, but I don’t think the “MVP” Giannis will be able to lead his squad to a title over that much talent on one team. So, will it be the Sixers?

It's pretty obvious to people who have watched multiple eras that Jordan received exponentially more favorable calls than Lebron in critical elimination pending situations. People will bring up that he only got favorable calls later in his career but I disagree. For example I was rewatching game 5 of the 1993 ECFs and the amount of phantom fouls Jordan and the Bulls received in crunch time of that close game is just as bad as the 2002 WCFs, which is regarded as one of the worst examples of reffing

In comparison Lebron doesn't get even close to the same special foul treatment. He's never really had favorable calls on him in close games/game 7s in the same way Jordan has, and if you took last second favorable foul calls out of the equation Jordan would have 3 or 2 rings at the most while Lebron would have roughly the same amount he does now. It's no secret that players like Jordan and Kobe recieved those calls. 

This specifically is important because the main case for MJ &gt; Lebron in 2019 rests on his playoffs/finals record since Lebron has bested him in virtually every meaningful statistical category on objectively inferior teams during a more difficult era in a harder eastern conference that doesn't let low 30 win teams into the playoffs. Outside of teams like the Pistons and Sonics, Jordan didn't face defense anywhere near as hard as Lebron did with the widespread incorporation of zone and the claim that Jordan played in a more physical era is neutralized by the ridiculous fouls he and Malone would recieve as a result of said physicality.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,50527,public,self,How do people reconcile Jordan's supposed greatness with the plethora of phantom foul calls he received?,0,1560969637,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/c261r6/how_do_people_reconcile_jordans_supposed/,,,,,,,,,,

Especially lottery picks.

First off rookies are coming from playing college ball and about 40 games a year. Now double that with much more travel.

Every year its become more clear that the regular season means nothing. Its all about being healthy and fresh for the playoffs. Why waste thousands of minutes on a rookies legs for nothing? And risk injury?

I think teams should load manage key players (even rookies) 15-20 games a year. This is the only way to give players the best chance of being healthy and playing at their max in the playoffs. 

In an ideal world the NBA regular season would be about 60-65 games a year. No back to backs. No 4 games in 6 days. But it isn't. And that places massive loads on players.

But what about in the past? Players didn't load manage?

Larry Bird was DONE after year 10.  Magic was DONE after 29. Isaiah was Done after 30. Sure there is your rare physical freak like KAJ.

And today's game is even worse on the body.  All players are expected to close out on 3-points shooters. All players are expected to switch and guard all 5 positions. The pace is very fast. The court is loaded with shooters so players need to guard a much bigger area. In the old day you could basicially stay 2 steps away from the key at all times.

The Lakers also only have about 5 players on their team right now, so perhaps that would have been their plan regardless. 

I think **JJ Redick** would be an obvious choice if he wanted to leave Philly, who is about to be paying a lot of money for next year's roster. However, he already has a defined role in Philadelphia and they have championship aspirations next season, perhaps even more than the Lakers. He made 12.5 million last year and will have no shortage of offers given his skill set. Another option is **Patrick Beverly**, a great defender that can compete with the amazing point guards of the West and shoots 3s decently. These are both the kind of guards you want to put around LeBron. 

Anthony Davis prefers to play the 4, and has said as much, opening a need for a true center. I'd be calling either Brook or Robin Lopez, but, Brook has already had a less than stellar stint in purple and gold. DeAndre Jordan or DeMarcus Cousins are both available but I feel they will be looking to be paid more elsewhere. **Nerlens Noel** is a Klutch Sports client and has a player option for this year, and if he wound up the starting 5 in LA I wouldn't be even a bit surprised. 

Similar to Noel, Markieff Morris is a Klutch client and is a UFA. I don't think he fills any need for this team but he could be roster backfill. The team retaining Kentavious Caldwell-Pope or Rajon Rondo is also not out of the question, but, these are at best bench players right now and I would not be excited to see them come back next season. Rondo at least is a good bench playmaker.

If they don't win the Ring in 2020 Finals, the next time Lebron makes the Finals he will be pushing 37 years old and making $40 million.

Once Lebron drops out of being a top10 player (2021 pushing 37 years old) they drop out of contention. No way AD can carry the entire load.

With the AD trade the Lakers literally have ZERO assets to trade. All their future #1 picks cannot be traded. No way to add depth. This team has to be carried by AD/Lebron.  We all saw how AD failed at carrying the Pelicans. And pushing 37 years old I don't see Lebron being able to do it either.

The only way they can extend the window pass 1 year is if they trade Lebron for a Star or a bunch of quality player. But even that probably won't work. We've seen AD failed at being the man.

It looked like he didn't get the credit he felt he deserved. But after missing so much time in the playoffs its pretty obvious that the Warriors needed KD. Draymond thought he didn't need KD either. This playoffs made his comments about KD seem like foolishness.

When KD played and got injured in the Finals he became a true Warrior. For life. Warrior fans were hit and miss with KD. Some liked him. They appreciated him. But many felt they were robbed of seeing Curry dominate and get the spotlight. But now the truth is out. The Warriors need KD and Curry to reach the top. Sure they won in 2015, but the league has caught up with the Warriors Death Line up and now every single contending team has a lineup to counter it. 

For the first time as a Warrior, KD gets what craves. Respect from the NBA community and love from the Warrior fans. There really is no reason for him to leave now. If he didn't get injured and the Warriors waltzed to another title he would not. There would still be questions if they really needed KD after all. The fans would not love him like they do now. He gave everything. He risked everything. And the Warrior fans love him for this.

If KD leaves I think the Warrior dynasty is over. They still will be contenders but I doubt they win another title unless something crazy happens. Like what happened with Toronto this year. 

But if KD stays? The Dynasty continues. Even if KD is only a top 10-15 player when he returns. They still will be the favorite to win the title with Curry, KD, and Klay in 2020/2021.

I also think the franchise needs a reset. 5 years of playing 100+ games and making the Finals is tough. Most teams are toast after 3 Finals runs.

I think it will be refreshing for Steph, Dray, and other Warriors to have a 'fun' year. A year with zero expectations. This should also benefit the young players like Looney, Bell, Cook, and McKinney. They can all develop and get more minutes in a less stressful environment. Steph/Dray won't have to play heavy minutes to get a top seed. They both should rest 15-20 games next year. The main goal should be to recharge their batteries and develop the young players. Klay should also be back the last month of the season. No stress. No pressure for his return. Just play the game they love.

Then 2020/2021.

Curry and Green should be fresh, healthy, and hungry. They would have 1 full year of recharging their battery. Klay should be close to 100%. A full 16 months since the surgery.  The young players will be better and more seasoned. Then they bring KD back. Slowly. By the All Star break the team should be running like a well oiled machine. Fully motivated. Fully charged. And fully armed to make a run at 2 or 3 more Rings.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,50469,public,self,Injuries to KD/Klay may extend the Dynasty,0,1560956481,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/c23ahl/injuries_to_kdklay_may_extend_the_dynasty/,,,,,,,,,,

Of them, only one team has never used either of the colors blue or red in their team color scheme or regular alternate (non-promotional such as Christmas or one-time throwbacks). That would be the Boston Celtics, who have stuck with green and gold throughout the entirety of the team's existence. As far as the Seattle Super Sonics go, because they and OKC Thunder are the same franchise, I counted them together for blue. And for the San Antonio Spurs, if their teal part of the logo back in the 1990's wasn't blue enough, they were formerly known as the Dallas Chaparrals and thus they had both blue and red in their color scheme. Please take note from this that the team did not need to use blue/red at the time that they won their respective title(s), just that they did use it at some point in the franchise's history.

Wade averaged 27 a game on 68 TS% against the 06' Pistons who were a top five offense and defense and won 64 games. He subsequently went on to win the finals with very little assistance from his teammates - having one of the best finals performances of all time in the process, after going down 2-0 against the Mavericks, he dropped 42/13/2/2, 36/6/3/1/1, 43/4/4/3/0 and 36/10/5/4/3 to close the series in 6 games. Moreover, many believe that Wade's peak was his 09' season where he averaged 30.2/5/7.5/2.2/1.3 on .574 TS% (.30% above the average of .544%) appearing in 79 games whereas Kawhi's peak averages are 26.6/7.3/3.3/1.8/0.4 on .607 TS% (.47% above the average of .560%) appearing in 60 games.

This despite being a terrible organization in nearly every aspect. I mean, do I need to rehash their recent history?  

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen people list all kinds of reasons, but they don't seem to hold up on closer inspection, but let's list them out.

&amp;#x200B;

1) ""They have a bunch of titles and have had great players in the past"" - Ok, but so have the Celtics and Bulls and those teams aren't anywhere near the free agent draws the lakers are. Ditto for the Spurs despite having the greatest coach of all time and a more recent championship pedigree. I also doubt once the Warrior dynasty is truly dead that they will now suddenly become a free agent draw like the lakers are. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) ""They play in a glamorous market"". Ok, but so do the Clippers, Nets, and Knicks and, depending on how liberal you are with the term, the Bulls, Heat, and Warriors.  New York is supposedly the greatest market of all and they've stunk for two decades. This btw, includes all the hoopla about celebrities, comedy shows and music venues. The lakers are hardly the only team to offer these things. 

&amp;#x200B;

3) ""They have great weather"" - Again, so do the Clippers and Warriors and that's barely a talking point. I don't think AD came because of that.

&amp;#x200B;

4) ""Because they are the lakers!"" - Yeah, but why???

&amp;#x200B;

It's even funnier when you see that none of these so called advantages apply to any other team in any other sport. The Yankees and Red Sox land top free agents because they pay more.  No one in the NFL has exceptionalism like this, not even the Patriots.  So what gives about the Lakers?

&amp;#x200B;

If I had to haphazard a guess - its just become cool to be a laker and you somehow earn even more media attention being a laker than any other uniform. Maybe that's a legacy of Magic Johnson, which was then enhanced by Kobe Bryant and was kept alive by Lebron and now AD? 

&amp;#x200B;

That raises a second thought experiment. If Lebron never comes to LA, then do the lakers eventually lose exceptionalism for a decade long drought of losing? My guess is no, not until Kobe becomes a distant memory.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,50301,public,self,Where is Lakers Exceptionalism coming from?,0,1560894125,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/c1tkcg/where_is_lakers_exceptionalism_coming_from/,,,,,,,,,,

Devin Booker, heck I even skipped the games against my team. Didn't see him or Deandre Ayton once. 

Add Kemba to the list. If Marc Gasol hadn't been traded to the Raptors team, I would have seen with my eyes as much of him in the past 5 years as I have Mike Conley, which is again, close to zero. I have no idea if DeAndre Jordan has anything left, and heck, I don't even think I've seen Kristaps play more than 3 times. 

Going beyond the stars, I don't really have an informed take on anyone beyond a few teams. I have no idea how Myles Turner is developing, if Trae Young or JJJ or Kevin Knox is about to pop, or if Zach Lavine's defense is improving. I couldn't pick Bam Adebayo out of a lineup.

The summer is in some ways as exciting a time as there is in the NBA season, but I'm already done with internet takes on whether AD was worth 6 players, free agency ""best fits"", etc. There are some well-informed posts floating around, but it's mostly people blathering about guys they haven't seen play for 500 minutes in their career.

I originally posted this in the Knicks sub, but i decided to copy and paste it here** 

**Atlanta**

Trae  Young really stepped up in the 2nd half of the season. Looking like he  could be an offensive/playmaking star. john Collins probably one of the  more well rounded young guys. He can shoot, rebound, defend. Great young  player. Kevin Huerter looks like a nice complimentary role player. Not a  high ceiling but a valuable skill set

**Boston**

Jayson  Tatum is a rising star in the league. Took a slight step back this  season but still shows great promise. Jalen Brown showed that he doesnt  have the ceiling we once thought. More likely to be a borderline all  star than a big time star.

**Brooklyn**

Dl'o  and Levert really proved this year that they have all star potential.  Dl'o made it as an injury replacement but Levert would have definetly  got the nod over him as he's been the better more consistently player  when healthy. Allen has shown good two way potential. He can score,  rebound, and defend. He's trying to stretch his game out to the 3 point  line.

**Chicago**

They  have an all offense almost no defense core. Lavine and Lauri are very  very talented offensive players who struggle defensively. Carter  compliments them very well as their interior defender/post scorer.

**Cleveland**

They pretty much have nothing ouside of Collin Sexton. They should hope that they can land Jarret Culver

**Dallas**

Doncic  put up some historic rookie numbers paving the way for his stardom.  They also picked up KP from us allowing them to have a nice dynamic duo.  A lot of their success relies on how healthy KP can be

**Memphis**

As  of right now their only legit prospect is JJJ. and he is as legit as  you can get. Easily one of the most versatile two way big men this  league has. Dillon Brooks is also a high level young player

**New York**

Half  of the Knicks young players were solid this year, half of them put up  some of the worst numbers in the league. Mitch, Dot, and Trier showed  that their legit NBA players, Dot and Trier showed more of a 6th  man/supporting role while Robinson showed high defensive potential.  Frank made very little improvements, DSJ while he has all the tools to  be good, still hasnt gotten it together yet. Knox i feel is an enigma.  He had flashes of being really good and flashes of being really bad. Too  early to tell with him

**NOLA**

Ingram,  Lonzo, Hart. You cant ask for a much better core in year 1 of your  rebuild. They easily have the best core moving forward.

**Phoenix**

They have two great young talents. Booker is a young superstar and Ayton looks to be another star in the making

**Sacramento**

Fox  made the leap this year and proved his worth as a young star in this  league. Bagley struggled in the beginning but ended the year off very  strong as well. Also Bogdonovi (cant spell his name sorry) is a very  good shooter, gives Fox the spacing he needs. (Omitting Hield from this  since hes liek 26)

Ranking  these young cores, keep in mind im excluding any projected/hypothetical  draft picks from this ranking until after the 20th  (so no Zion, Ja,  RJ, etc)

This rank is only on their young players, how they performed so far, and their (projected) potential shown so

1. Dallas
2. Boston
3. Brooklyn
4. Atlanta
5. Sacramento
6. Chicago
7. Phoenix
8. NOLA
9. New York
10. Memphis
11. Cleveland

A couple side notes.

Dallas and Boston are at the top because Doncic and Tatum are the 2nd/3rd best players out of all the teams. Booker is the best

Sacramento is above Chicago because Fox's potential surpasses what Lavine and Lauri can reach imo

I  think Sacramento, Chicago, and Phoenix's positions are interchangeable.  Phoenix has the best player in booker, but Chi and Sac have more high  quality young players on their team (Booker/Ayton)  (Dunn/Lavine/Lauri/Carter) (Fox/Bogi/Bagley)

Knicks  are 9th because we dont have a star player. I love Mitch but hes not  better than any of the teams best players above us. And while he has  high defensive potential, offensive stars &gt; defensive stars.

We  are above Memphis not because we have a better player than them, JJJ is  better than all of our prospects, its because we have more young guys.

I  left off Denver and Philly because they're contenders and would easily  be number 1 and 2 on this list. Jokic and Embiid are far and beyond  better anyone on this list.

I was thinking of how shit the nba awards show is so I decided to think of how to make it better. I was also thinking of how the first round was kinda crappy outside of a couple series this year so I thought of how to make that better as well.

What I'm proposing:
NBA season ends a full 7 days before the start of the playoffs. The NBA Awards show should be 1-2 days after the season ends. How to get people interested and players of teams attending?

Allow top seeds to choose their first round opponents. The first seeds from both conferences will choose their opponents during the show. Followed by the second seeds and the third seeds. This way, us NBA fans will actually watch the show because we won't even know what the first round matchups would be. Teams would attend since they can't gameplan if they aren't aware of who their opponent is. The NBA awards aren't meaningless and MVP and other awards can be adequately celebrated. 

This also incentivizing the top teams to not start resting late in the season as they will still have an incentive to play for versus the other top three seeds. 

The NBA Awards show actually becomes something interesting that us nephews will want to watch.

What do you guys think of this as an alternative play-off format.

Let's create a playoff system with more marquee matchups, better games for lower seeds, and fairer advantages for seeding. Here’s how: implement a new format splitting playoff teams into top and bottom groups – pitting the best against the best to win a week off, and giving the bottom half of the table a chance to remain relevant.

Under this proposed system the bottom 4 teams play off in elimination games (5 v 8 and 6 v 7). This immediately offers each of these teams a chance at playoff success. The 5 and 6 seeds now come in as favourites with home court – while the 7 and 8 seeds get a legitimate shot at the second round. This provides good not great teams opportunities for playoff experience, wins, and for their fanbases to experience exciting playoff games and series.

Meanwhile, alongside the excitement of our first round elimination games, the top four teams play off in qualification games (1 v 4 and 2 v 3) with the winning team skipping a playoff round and the losing team facing a winner of the previously mentioned elimination games. This creates marquee matchups beginning in round 1 of the playoffs – pitting the best players and teams against each other. It also greatly incentives teams to play hard in the regular season as a top 4 seed guarantees 2 playoff rounds – and a top 2 seed gives you home court advantage in the qualification games.

From here round two of the playoffs is between the winner of an elimination game winner vs the loser of a qualification game. Round 3 (Conference semi-finals) pits the winner of round 2 games against the original winners of the qualifications games. Finally, the Semi-Final winners play off in the Conference Finals.

So far, it’s pretty confusing. I’ve even added a playoff round. So let’s see how it would have worked in the 2019 Western Conference.

**Qualification Round 1**

Rockets V *Warriors*(2-4)

*Blazers* V Nuggets (4-3)

**Elimination Round 1**

*Clippers* V Jazz (4-3)

Spurs V *Thunder* (2-4)


**Round 2**

Clippers V *Nuggets* (3-4)

Thunder V *Rockets* (2-4)

**Conference Semi Finals**

Nuggets V *Warriors* (1-4)

*Rockets* V  Blazers (4-3)


**Conference Finals**

Rockets V *Warriors* (2-4)

I’m biased – but it looks great. In round 1 The Clippers get suitably rewarded for sneaking into the playoffs with a series that could really go either way, the Thunder face Pop and Demar, and the Nuggets lose to the Blazers – but are rewarded for their regular season seeding with another shot. This sets the tone for a playoff series filled with close, exciting series right through. The Rockets follow up their defeat to GSW with a chance at redemption and a chance to prove themselves as the Conference’s second-best team. More importantly, I would want to watch every suggested playoff series.

The same engaging, exciting series would happen in the East under this system too.

This system creates more engaging series, it would foster rivalries as teams play each other more regularly, and give lower seed teams a real shot to win a playoff series or two. It extends the playoffs and puts more focus on the basketball over the behind the scenes. The complexity could be a minor issue, but imo it would only drive talking points and controversy while the best teams face off over and over again.

Footnotes: Each round 1 and 2 series would have a game every 2 days to ensure that winning the rest would be an advantage.

Under this system we are keeping Conferences. I like Conferences because they create randomness and talking points. Fight me.

He said that lots of mid to lower tier players are going to have a rude awakening if they're not part of the first round of pick ups by teams and that contending teams might be able to fill up on talent on the cheap because if you're going to be forced to take a lower contract you might as well do it for a title.

But he would not have been able to help the Lakers win a championship and I doubt he could be effective past the first round.

To begin, Lonzo shot a paltry 41.7% from the free throw line. We've seen time and time again that playoff games often have close scores, which makes every free throw even more important. The Warriors won Game 5 and effectively Game 6 by two free throws. I believe playing him in the playoffs would only inspire teams to use a Hack-a-Zo strategy.

Second, Lonzo effectively can only shoot threes, which he makes at a subpar rate, 32.9% last season. His odd shooting form will make it difficult for him to shoot from the right wing and right corner when tightly guard. The best player in this past post-season were able to demonstrate versatililty with their scoring methods: shooting threes, layups, floaters and mid range shooting. His one dimensional scoring would have hindered the team, if LeBron and Anthony Davis were able to push the Lakers to the playoffs. They are both paint dominant players and need shooters around them to stretch the floor.

Third, while Lonzo is a great passer and playmaker in transition, he's not great at running half court sets and he  disappears in half court. While the playoffs are full of fast-paced plays in transitions, the moments where the offense slows down are also important. After the Warriors Game 4 loss, Stephen Curry noted that the Warriors needed to slow down the game, instead of speeding up their play to match the Raptors. I'm not convinced Lonzo has the control to do so deep in the playoffs when teams are vying for the championship. 

Every post-season we see the impact injuries can have on a team. The Warriors were the favorites to win the championship and viewed as an unbeatable foe but after several injuries to key players, the Warriors were only a shade of what they were expected to be and the Raptors overtook them. The fact that Lonzo has played a total of 99 games in the past two seasons does not bode well for his playoff performance. The Lakers couldn't take the risk of their starting point guard falling to injury before or during the playoffs and having the coaching staff scramble to build a new scheme with a new point guard.

This may be a reach but I'm open to objections and discussions but I don't believe that Lonzo has the mentality to succeed in the playoffs. This post season, the Nuggets and Trailblazers showed their grit by grinding through 4 over times. Draymond saved the Warriors from elimination in Game 5 leaping for a Ball that was release so high, only a millimeter of his middle finger grazed the ball. Lonzo generally isn't aggressive in games. On the Shop, LeBron's ""talk show"", Lonzo said he didn't feel comfortable with the superstar until All Star weekend. He doesn't seem to have the mentality to face the pressure of the playoffs. 

I understand the trade must be tough for Lonzo. He dreamed of playing on the Lakers his whole life and when he was drafted, he was heralded as the successor to Magic Johnson. After the Lakers hired Jason Kidd, I'm sure he thought it was a good sign that he would be excluded from trade talks. But with the acquisition of LeBron and the abject failure of the past season, the Lakers have to switch into ""win-now"" mode while planning for the playoffs. I hope Lonzo can develop and become the player he's always wanted to be on his new team",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,49866,public,self,"Even if it were not in a trade for Anthony Davis, trading Lonzo Ball was an absolute necessity if the Laker wanted to compete for a championship",0,1560802850,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/c1eg1j/even_if_it_were_not_in_a_trade_for_anthony_davis/,,,,,,,,,,

LeBron James and Jeff Green still probably have some lasting camaraderie from his season in Cleveland, as when Kevin Love went down for games 6/7 of the ECF, Jeff Green stepped up huge to help out Bron. Bron was very outspoken about what Green did for the team. He can space the floor (just averaged 35% from 3 last season), adds size, can create off the dribble and get to the line. He is a great bench piece if you need scoring and somebody to take some pressure off pure shooters. Defensively he is alright, but nothing to write home about. He has been healthy recently and just came off a great season with the wizards, a low risk pick-up that won't command too much money

2. *Al-Faroq Aminu: The Chief*

I think if you strike out on Green Aminu provides a discounted version of everything that Green would. Granted he isn't as good off the dribble, he showed that he can be a solid catch and shoot player

3. *Terrance Ross*

If the price is right, of course. Ross will definitely command some money on the market, as his last season in Orlando was more or less a breakout for him. He is a great shooter with unparalleled confidence. He showed that he can finish at the rim and is a servicable wing defender as well.

4. *Nerlens Noel/JaVale McGee*

It's doubtful that Nerlens re signs with the thunder on his player option after the great season he had coming off the bench. Both of these players would be great choices as a backup center for the Lakers, as they both can defend well and are great rim runners. JaVale should be more successful than last year as he will not have to be playing so many minutes every game with AD as a starting center

5. *Seth Curry/JJ Redick*

We know what these two players can do. If you can get both you should, but it's unlikely. Teams will be clamoring for these two shooters on the market, but lebron will definitely maximize their potential


No, the Lakers will not get all of these players with their (27?) million, but they should definitely look into getting as many as possible if they strike out on big names/max contracts.

But if you look at him rationally, he is actually anything but.

- Not only forced a privately owned franchise to fire their GM because he was running a team in a way he didn't like, and not only that but forced them to hire his friend as their GM who proceeded to mess up the franchise.

- He has threatened players with punishment for kneeling for the anthem, which you all hated Goodell and the ""backwards racist NFL"" for, because he saw the negative effects the protests caused for the NFL. Yes there is a clause in the CBA mentioning this, but you cannot sit there and tell me he couldn't bring this up and have it at least discussed, let alone THREATENING players who dare do it. He didn't do so because he did not want the negative press and fanbase reaction the NFL got.

- He allowed Jimmy Butler to intentionally sabotage his teammates, roster, and front office to force them to trade him.

- He merely fined Dallas for a massive decade-plus long sexual harassment suit against them while the NFL forced a similar owner (Jerry Richardson of the Panthers) to sell his team.

- He has threatened franchises with massive fines for literally just resting players in an overly long regular season and forcing them to coach how he wants them to because to Silver, TV ratings are more important than player health. All other sports leagues can rest players all the time and it's no problem. And then players suffer overuse injuries due to his draconian policy. Now teams have to come up with excuses like ""load management"" that they specifically have to get cleared by him to allow them to rest players.
       
      - This was really exemplified in the Anthony Davis situation where Davis told the Pelicans he was not re-signing with them, tries to force their hand by giving a very short list of teams he would accept a trade to, then when they couldn't work it out and wanted to rest him to keep him healthy to maximize return on his trade demand in the offseason, Silver threatened them with fines because ""resting a star player is bad for TV ratings.""

- He ruined the NBA regular season awards by putting them after the season is over after people stop caring about them because he wanted a cash grab television program to get ad revenue, TV ratings, and keep the league in peoples' minds after the Finals ended. Fans and players hate it but Silver prioritizes cash &gt; all.

- First American sports commissioner to put advertisements on jerseys

- Idea to ""solve"" tanking is to equivocate the top 3 lottery odds so that legitimately worse teams get punished

And on top of all that, Silver completely ignores the NBA's real issues like officiating, parity, tanking, and pretends like they don't exist. Can you guys here try to convince me he's actually good?

It was almost a consensus that the Orlando Magic had one of the worst seasons ever for a team that won their division. But is this the first time that something like this has happened in league history? Let's look at some numbers.

* **Least Wins in a Season for a Division Winner:** technically it's 33 wins (1998-1999 Indiana Pacers, but came in lockout shortened season so they went 33-17).

* **Worst Seeding of a Division winner in the Playoffs:** the Orlando Magic get this honor, barely making the Playoffs as the 7th seed, and facing the eventual NBA champion Raptors in the first round.

* **Worst Record of a Division Winner ever:** 38-44 (the Washington Wizards, then known as the Baltimore Bullets, finished with this record and won their division back in 1971-72. Because seeding rules were different, favoring division winners over more worthy non-division-winning teams, they got the 2nd seed in the playoffs.

So taking all of this into account, let's compare the Southeast Division from this past season with the 1971-72 Central Division.

**2018-19 Southeast Division**

* **1st:** Orlando Magic (42-40 record)

* **2nd:** Charlotte Hornets (39-43 record)

* **3rd:** Miami Heat (39-43 record)

* **4th:** Washington Wizards (32-50 record)

* **5th:** Atlanta Hawks (29-53 record)

**1971-72 Central Division**

* **1st:** Baltimore Bullets (38-44 record)

* **2nd:** Atlanta Hawks (36-46 record)

* **3rd:** Cincinnati Royals (30-52 record)

* **4th:** Cleveland Cavaliers (23-59 record)

In fact, the entire Eastern Conference back in 1971-72 was crap. Here's a lock at the final seeding that year:

* **1st:** Boston Celtics (56-26 record; won division)

* **2nd:** Baltimore Bullets (38-44 record; won division)

* **3rd:** New York Knicks (48-34 record; made playoffs)

* **4th:** Atlanta Hawks (36-46 record; made playoffs)

* **5th:** Philadelphia 76ers (30-52 record; missed playoffs)

* **6th:** Cincinnati Royals (30-52 record; missed playoffs)

* **7th:** Cleveland Cavaliers (23-59 record; missed playoffs)

* **8th:** Buffalo Braves (22-60 record; missed playoffs)

Meanwhile, in the Western Conference that year:

* **1st:** Los Angeles Lakers (69-13 record; won division)

* **2nd:** Milwaukee Bucks (63-19 record; won division)

* **3rd:** Chicago Bulls (57-25 record; made playoffs)

* **4th:** Golden State Warriors (51-31 record; made playoffs)

* **5th:** Phoenix Suns (49-33 record; missed playoffs)

* **6th:** Seattle Super Sonics (47-35 record; missed playoffs)

* **7th:** Houston Rockets (34-48 record; missed playoffs)

* **8th:** Detroit Pistons (26-56 record; missed playoffs)

* **9th:** Portland Trail Blazers (18-64 record; missed playoffs)

Obviously, it was a different landscape then: 17 teams, 4 divisions of 4 teams each except the Pacific with 5, current Eastern Conference teams in the Western Conference, and 4 currently relocated franchises. However, that Central division was absolutely abysmal. The fact that these teams played as many times as they did that season and still all finished up with losing records is shocking.

Having the tools doesn't mean that you will reach that ceiling though, just shows that there is a possibility.

His strengths are his athleticism, ability to get into the paint at will, finishing ability, and he has around average passing and vision for a point guard. He's also a pretty good pick and roll ball handler as well

His weaknesses are his defense, efficiency, and his jumpshot. When DSJ was first traded to the knicks his jumpshot looked pretty good. He dropped 31 points and 25 (i think it was 25) points against detroit in two outings. Then all of a sudden his shot developed a hitch. Its extremely noticeable when he takes free throws.

Unlike Griffin however, Kemp was also a great defender and had several years in the top10 in defensive win shares, though playing alongside Gary Payton obviously helped. Over his All-Star season, Kemp also averaged 1.4 steals and 1.5 blocks per game.

For these reasons, I think Shawn Kemp and Zion Williamson should be more closely examined for a comparison. On [The Ringer's 2019 Draft Guide](https://nbadraft.theringer.com/), they only give Charles Barkley, Blake Griffin, and Julius Randle as comparisons. I am quite against the Blake comparison, but that's for another post.

These videos can give an idea of how Kemp used his skills to his advantage.

Similarities I see:

- Both are explosive, coordinated, and versatile attackers while in the air both off of lobs and their own dribble drives, though I don't see Zion having as much success as a point-blank dunker off of dump-offs in a crowded paint due to his height.
- Powerful inside scoring, though Zion has arguably not faced an all-time great inside defender unless you count the mighty Tacko Fall (lol). With a head of steam and a little bit of space to drive, a foul or two points from a ferocious dunk are essentially a sure thing.
- Great at catching high or lob passes off the seal, though Zion has more potential in this move thanks to his bowling-ball stature.
- Tremendous rebounding ability on both ends, though I do not see Zion getting more putback scores in a packed paint than Kemp because of his height.
-  Impressive ball-handling skills for their positions, lots of potential for grab-and-go and attacking the break, though Kemp had great deceleration ability while Zion just muscled through college boys. Hard to say how Zion translates as a ball handler on the break compared to Kemp.
- Impressive passing instincts for their positions, though Kemp operated more from the low post and Zion on the break, which goes to show how similar skillsets translate in different eras.
- While Kemp had a great turnaround jumper, Zion's 285lb dropstep will be devastating even for NBA defenders. I think Zion projects as just as dominant of a post player as Kemp, just in a different way in terms of his scoring threat.

Differences: 

- Kemp has a much smoother shot and had the ability to shoot off the pullup as well as pump fake and drive. As of right Zion's form is simply bad, he has no pullup threat and he is unlikely to get NBA defenders to jump at his fakes. Basically Kemp is just a much better shooter and floor spacer, giving him more versatility in slower half-court settings. For this reason I could see Zion struggling offensively in the playoffs if the Pelicans make it early in his career.
- Kemp has 3 inches on Zion, but Zion is much bulkier and has around 50lb (!!!) on Kemp while still having spectacular athleticism.
- Defensive tape on Kemp is hard to find but I don't see how ANY big in history compares to Zion on defending the perimeter. Laterally, Zion is very fast and has great hands to poke the ball loose. On the inside end, Zion is also dominant but I think his true potential lies as a help defender like Miami LeBron, not as a straight-up shotblocker.
	
In my own conclusion, Zion Williamson and Shawn Kemp compare quite similarly in terms of broad skills and talents; both of them are absurdly athletic, good passers, great defenders, strong post players, etc. But their true differences that set them apart lie in how they operate, largely due to the era they play in. One is a great low-post passer, one is a great fastbreak passer. One is a classic shotblocker with stealing ability for a big, the other projects as an all-time disruptive help defender. Both are low-post monsters, but one is a more fluid and versatile operator while the other simply muscles his way in. Obviously these are simplifications, but I think they give the general idea of how the two compare and differ.

* Lebron is getting older and it probably isn't a good idea to put such a heavy load on him on the offensive end, we've already seen that he has been trying to conserve energy on defense as much as possible.
* AD is far more talented then Bosh and Love and it would seem too much of waste to not utilize AD to his full potential

A little food for thought as we are still close to a month away from when the player ranking is due.

&amp;#x200B;

**I formulated a method last season to rank every team and this method was very successful last year.**

Before the season, with the help of this method, I correctly predicted:

\-Toronto would beat Golden State in the Finals

\-3/4 Conference Finals teams

\-6/8 Semi Finals Teams

\-Clippers/Nets/Kings would exceed expectations.

&amp;#x200B;

(picture proof, with date in top right corner)

[https://imgur.com/gallery/nV8nJQ0](https://imgur.com/gallery/nV8nJQ0)

&amp;#x200B;

**I also got some stuff wrong as well to be clear:**

\-Predicted Lakers would make WCF (I think they do if LeBron stays healthy whole year still)

\-Portland/OKC/Denver would all miss playoffs

\-Heat 4 seed (missed playoffs)

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the formula I use:

\-take the rankings of the top 9 players on each team from my overall ranking.

\-add the draft value of each pick in the 1st round (for example, Pelicans have 1st pick. Top rookie ranked in 2017-2018 was Ben Simmons at 17, last season Luka at 40. 29 give or take is in between 17 and 40, so the first overall pick has a value of 29th. So add the number 29 to the Pelicans roster and remove the worst ranked player from the rotation)

\-Add up all of the numbers on each team. Whomever has the lowest number is the best team, whomever has the highest number is the worst team. Even after the media attention with the Warriors signing Cousins for an all star starting 5 last year, the Raptors had a higher rating than the Warriors to my shock. Using this data, I predicted Toronto would win the Finals.

***Addition***

\-Seeing I had the Thunder and the Nuggets miss the playoffs last year, something needed to change. With Jokic, PG, Westbrook, Lillard I clearly was not valuing star power enough. So:

*top 5 player -150 from overall team number*

*top 6-10 player -100 from overall team number*

*top 11-17 -50 from overall team number*

Again, keep in mind the lower the team number the better the team's ranking will be. I will also include the team number for each team.

&amp;#x200B;

***Free Agency/Next Season Predictions:***

I'm not going too crazy with this right now but just from a basic standpoint:

\-KD/Klay not included for Warriors. John Wall not included for Wizards. I am going to include Oladipo for Pacers as I think he will play at some point next year.

\-Kyrie to Nets. Also, as the fall off between 8th rotation player and 9th is pretty steep I'm going to add 150 and remove worst rotation player as they'll probably pick someone up of equal value.

\-D'Angelo Russell to Dallas (simply based off them having highest odds other than Nets)

\-gave Dallas 50 points for KP + removed worst rotation player, gave San Antonio 100 points for DeJounte Murray + removed worst rotation player.

\-Lakers get 50 points + remove worst rotation player. I am making an educated prediction that they will add somebody of top 50 overall value.

\-the rest of the free agents remain on same team for now.

\-retired players from 2018-2019 removed.

&amp;#x200B;

**My Pre Draft/FA Top 30 Teams**

&amp;#x200B;

|30. New York Knicks (1662)|RJ Barrett is going to be their most valued player right away, and he's going to have the keys. A big free agent could move them up a little bit, but even then playoffs would be questionable.|
|:-|:-|
|29. Cleveland Cavaliers (1578)|Right now Cavs are 2nd to worst, but if Collin Sexton shows sophomore progression + Kevin Love returns to near elite they could move up.|
|28. Detroit Pistons (1535)|My formula was not a fan of them last year either and they made the playoffs so they could prove me wrong again. To be quite frank, this is a franchise that it would probably be better for them to tank a year anyways.|
|27. Chicago Bulls (1524)|We are starting out with all Eastern Conference teams, early on the Bulls are 11th. That could move up, and they could be a sleeper 8 seed if Lauri progresses and WCJ proves his value.|
|26. Charlotte Hornets (1520)|Holy crap another Eastern Conference team, Kemba is a saint for wanting to stay because if he gone they probably fall to 30th right away.|
|25. Atlanta Hawks (1472)|ANOTHER Eastern Conference team. No Western yet. This puts ATL a 10 seed for 2019-2020 right now. As with Chicago, if the young players continue to progress, playoffs are not out of question.|
|24. Phoenix Suns (1326)|Just for reference, if Phoenix were in the Eastern Conference I would have them as a 9 seed. But they are the worst ranked in the west. With Phoenix, my stance has been one more year of sucking and shit could really start to happen (and quick) after then.|
|23. Orlando Magic (1321)|The Magic sit 9th and outside of the playoffs currently. With Orlando, my position, is that tanking would have been better for their long term future instead of having Vucci Man lead the team to over performing in a contract year. Tanking last season could have had them looking incredible going into next decade, they could be sitting in 8 seed purgatory now.|
|22. Washington Wizards (1308)|My current 8 seed in the East is Washington. They could legit be an 8 seed with a 35-47 record. This ranking is not including John Wall either keep in mind. The East depth is looking weak enough to where Bradley Beal carrying this team could mean a playoff berth.|
|21. Memphis Grizzlies (1306)|Not bad as a Grizzlies fan myself, depth needs to be improved, trading Conley for more depth and letting Ja/JJJ run the show could move them up. It's better for them to do good this year because if not top 6 the 1st round pick goes to Boston, and that is unprotected in 2021 which would be a big giant frown.|
|20. Miami Heat (1268)|Although 20th in the league, I have Miami 7th in the East. Even with the bad contracts, like last year, the depth is decent and with the East potentially being even less deep that could be enough for a playoff berth in 2019-2020.|
|19. Dallas Mavericks (1235)|This is with D'Angelo Russell theoretically on the team + Kristaps keep in mind. Point being: even if it's someone like Jimmy Butler, or another big name, the depth is just too weak right now. Who knows though: that was the case with Portland last year with what was around Lillard and everyone progressed. I could see a similar situation happening in Dallas.|
|18. LA Clippers (1171)|Last year I predicted them to make the playoffs. Next year could be a step back to take 3 steps forward. West will probably be deeper, but with Kawhi on the team this would change and quick.|
|17. Sacramento Kings (1171)|The Kings/Clippers were tied and I gave the Kings the edge. De'Aaron Fox could be an all star, Buddy Hield will be back, and MBIII could develop rapidly as Fox did as a sophomore. Although still 11th in the West, things are looking up regardless.|
|16. Minnesota Timberwolves (1108)|10th in West, middle of the pack, KAT becoming a bonafide monster could be good enough for an 8 seed.|
|15. Golden State Warriors (1059)|Okay shit just got real. Here's what's going on: if Klay/KD miss all of next year Curry/Draymond is not enough to carry this team. If they sign Klay/KD to max contracts then there could be depth issues. What if Curry/Draymond miss time? This isn't just not compete for a championship, they could legitimately miss the playoffs. Still, FA hasn't happened yet and they are still 9th in the West.|
|14. Oklahoma City Thunder (1058)|As of right now the Thunder barely edge the Warriors for the 8 seed. Having Roberson back next year could move them up, as has been the case since 2017 Sam Presti needs to figure out what to put around Westbrook/PG/Steven Adams because saying Alex Abrines being gone was a big reason for under exceeding late in the season (as he said) is just bad because you shouldn't have to rely on Alex Abrines for that type of situation in the first place.|
|13. LA Lakers (1040)|FA still has to happen, my gut says they move up more, for now they sit at the 7 seed. LeBron/AD is enough to get them in the playoffs. The depth needs to be fixed the next couple of weeks.|
|12. Philadelphia 76ers (1025)|Even with Embiid/Simmons/Butler/Harris the 76ers' sit at 6th in the East with my formula. As last season proved that core might not be enough. If Butler or Harris leave then the front office will have to regroup.|
|11. New Orleans Pelicans (1024)|My formula has the Pelicans currently ahead of the Lakers and the 6 seed in the West. Zion, Jrue Holiday, Lonzo, Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, 4th pick is a sexy core. Keep in mind however Randle might not be back so they could move down.|
|10. Boston Celtics (1019)|Even without Kyrie the depth will still be there, Tatum will get the green light, the odds strongly suggest they should still make the playoffs and I have them a 5 seed currently.|
|9. Brooklyn Nets (982)|This is with Kyrie. A Nets/Celtics playoff matchup (as this formula predicts right now) would be a shitstorm.|
|8. Houston Rockets (939)|A pre FA wildcard as rumor has it they wanna blow things up, as things stand now I have them a 5 seed. If they want to take further steps blowing things up might not be a terrible idea.|
|7. Utah Jazz (926)|Utah continues being one of the more well run franchises in the league, an early prediction: Rudy Gobert makes his 1st all star game in 2020. Another early prediction: they make the Western Conference Semi Finals. Things could change though, Rubio/Favors are likely leaving, next man up.|
|6. Indiana Pacers (920)|What they did without Oladipo is nothing short of incredible. They are a wildcard though, Oladipo's return timetable is unknown and there are multiple free agents among the core. This is a ceiling right now, although playoffs should be probable, more likely than not they move down after FA.|
|5. San Antonio Spurs (919)|Before DeJounte Murray went down, I predicted a Spurs WCF berth. I won't go that far right now again but I am giving them a 3 seed with his return for now. But some question marks before FA still, will DeRozan be traded?|
|4. Portland Trail Blazers (906)|Even with a playoff berth the year before, no team did a 180 more quickly than Portland did. Dame brings the star power, they went from crappy depth to one of the deeper teams in the league in one year, Anfernee Simons is exciting, post FA we'll see how things look but it's positive right now.|
|3. Denver Nuggets (893)|Denver is my early prediction at a 1 seed. We'll have to see what happens with the other teams in FA, regardless, I don't see them falling below a 3. I'll stop short of any other rapid predictions for now.|
|2. Milwaukee Bucks (718)|A Giannis/AD combo would have been dreamy. They are serious championship contenders next year as the circumstances stand.|
|1. Toronto Raptors (415)|The Raptors, per my formula, are the clear front runners for the Finals. There's a lot that could happen though. Long story short: Kawhi stays, my prediction leans Toronto repeat, Kawhi leaves, Giannis gets his 1st ring. I don't see that prediction changing by October but LeBron and AD could hit me with a stone cold stunner.|

Do they pursue a third star and push for a star studded big three? Or maybe they push for solid role players and depth, chancing the free market for the perfect side-kicks to James and Davis. Players such as Danny Green, Reddick, Jeremy Lamb, retaining Reggie Bullock, Trevor Ariza, Terrence Ross could all offer vital relief to the two stars. Although obviously many of these players might resign, there are plenty of names that have to be interested in playing alongside two all-time greats.

* Scoring: Kawhi 28.5ppg on 60.6%TS. Curry 30.5ppg on 59.8%TS (would be 61.8%TS if you took away his 5 end of quarter heaves). I think Curry was definitely better on scoring, even with the defensive attention and prowess of the Raptors. 
* Rebounds: Kawhi 9.8 total rebounds, 2.7 offensive rebounds per game. Curry 5.2 total rebounds, 1 offensive rebounds per game. Kawhi was a monster on the board, and got the edge here no doubt. 
* Assist: Kawhi 4.2 AST per game. Curry 6 AST per game. Assists numbers are not sole indicators of playmaking ability but it's not egregious to say that Curry playmaked better than Kawhi this series, given his passing ability as well as gravity.
* Defense: I won't pretend that I could tell individual defense on live games so it's up to you. I feel neither made a big defensive impact in the whole series, but Kawhi played better defense.
* Clutchness: Neither players were particularly clutch in the last 2 minutes of close games, as far as I can tell. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Wagner miiiiight be playable as a backup big if he makes a large leap this offseason but let’s assume he doesn’t. How do the Lakers fill it their squad? It seems likely they’ll chase Kemba/Kyrie for obvious reasons, but do you guys think that’s the way to go? 

Personally I think they’d be better off pursuing 3 solid role players with that money and a good bench piece with the MLE and spend the minimum on mostly vets looking for one last chance to contribute to a roster. For those role players, I think they could do with a 3&amp;D wing and pure point guard (maybe Ricky Rubio, but he could be too expensive and lacks shooting ability) and then a good big, and probably spend the MLE on a scoring two guard (maybe switch the big and guard in terms of money). 

It seems there won’t be any teams with more than 3 superstars next season (KD will reportedly out all next year, even if he does sign with the Warriors again), and judging by what the Raptors did I think the Lakers should follow suit in not trying to match the Warriors with 3 superstars. I think 2 is good enough to compete with any other team in the league at this point for next season, and barring the creation of a Warriors+KD-esque superteam, I think they are better suited getting a good supporting cast rather than hunting for a bird superstar and having only their core 4, a guy on the MLE, and then 8 minimum players on their roster.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,49647,public,self,How should the Lakers spend their remaining $32m + MLE?,0,1560735735,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/c14rqd/how_should_the_lakers_spend_their_remaining_32m/,,,,,,,,,,

Should they re-sign KD and Klay, they won't have any cap space to replace an apparently retiring Livingston. Andre Iguodala is still on the books, and Boogie is as good as gone. Now, if they let KD walk and just re-sign Klay, they'll have more leverage and chances to pull a better supporting cast alongside the original three. 

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I'm hoping that they re-sign both even for a non-contending season and fill the roster out with vets on the minimum who can still play, but this isn't 2K. Their most plausible course would be to let KD walk, re-sign Klay, trade players like Cook and Bell and fill out the roster with options.

[Which, in their case (since they're in the luxury tax) would be about $5.7 million, according to these projections.](https://www.hoopsrumors.com/2019/02/early-mid-level-bi-annual-projections-for-201920.html)  Where things start getting murkier, however, is when you consider the [disabled player exception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_salary_cap#Disabled_Player_Exception).  According to that link, this exception:

&gt;Allows a team that is over the cap to acquire a replacement for a disabled player who will be out for either the remainder of that season (for in-season injuries/deaths) or the next season (if the disability occurs during the offseason). The maximum salary of the replacement player is either 50% of the injured player's salary, or the mid-level exception for a non-taxpaying team, whichever is less.

So, if I'm understanding this correctly, if the Warriors re-sign KD for the max, and he misses the entire 2019-20 season (which seems likely), they will be eligible for the disabled player exception (which, according to the MLE projections linked above, will be worth about $9.25 million).  If KD signs elsewhere, they *might* be able to use this exception on Klay Thompson; however, I'm not sure that would be approved in Klay's case, as he might return later in 2020.  If anybody has a better understanding of NBA Salary Cap rules, then feel free to correct me; I don't know much about it to be honest, I'm just basing this off of the Wikipedia article.

Who are some players that Golden State could pick up with these two exceptions?  (MLE=$5.7 million, DPE=$9.25 million).",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,49384,public,self,Warriors offseason moves and salary cap exceptions,0,1560649076,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/c0ryod/warriors_offseason_moves_and_salary_cap_exceptions/,,,,,,,,,,

Now if Kawhi returns then this is obviously a moot point. 

However, I think we can all agree that everything came together perfectly for this Raptors team, such as getting the right players and some luck.

But, If Kawhi doesn't return, that team as currently constituted drops to being anywhere from a 4-8 seed team, who knows, they could be out of the playoffs all together. Meaning, there isn't a guy that they can point to and say, that's the future of the franchise.

Which is why I'm of the mindset, that if the Raports aren't true contenders after next season, they should just trade their assets and stockpile a bunch of picks and jump start the rebuild. The last thing you want is a slow decline into mediocrity because you prolonged the inevitable end.

I think the warriors could purposefully take their foot off the gas this upcoming season in order to gather assets that make them a stronger team once klay and KD come back.

Obviously , this scenario implies klay and KD come back ... which is not a given; but like I said earlier, this is just one of many possible paths the warriors front office could go down . 

I think they bring them back , even though , obviously, both guys are risks at this point . Unless, it was extremely transparent that both guys were offered maxes and preferred to go elsewhere. Then , I could see fans understanding it . Otherwise I think the organization takes a huge reputation hit .

Granted , bringing them back places GS in a tough position to compete this season . But, I think the front office and the fans are fully OK with taking the foot off the gas this year, if it means coming back stronger for the next 2-3 years . 

Look , KD and Klay may never be the same. I'm not saying they will be bad . Just that , there is a wide range of outcomes and I would say a decent variance within that range . Modern sports medicine is way better than before; but still, a player over 30 coming off of surgery to a knee or Achilles is a scary fucking prospect . 

To me , from here the solution is clear. They have to go younger . I'm not sure if they have the taxpayer MLE . If they do , they might not want to use it . They are deep in the tax . If I was in their shoes , I would use most of my available money to take a bunch of shots on younger guys with potential ... and see if anything sticks . I use potential in a relative sense. In other words , they aren't ""good"" yet . They have physical tools or skills that outweigh their current production. A gap in perceived future ability and current ability . 

IF GS takes this kind of approach . It's possible they might not be very good next year . They will do whatever it take to put themselves in a better position going forward. Curry and green (is he a FA ?) certainly have the ability to carry a team to regular season wins . But , the entire burden hasn't been placed on them for a while . How consistent can they be , how consistent can a bunch of vet-min type guys be ? 

Furthermore , how healthy can they stay ? Don't you think GS will be incredibly conservative with Curry and Green's health this year ? 

If GS gets off to a slow start this season , I think they could lose a fair amount of games this year . Definitely enough to miss the playoffs . The west is almost always a bloodbath. I don't know what kind of free agent movement will come this summer. But there is potential for a lot of development to already strong clubs . 

Point being , GS could end up with a lottery pick. They could end up with a top 10 pick . If curry suffers a moderate injury , they aren't going to rush him back just to try to get the 8th seed . 

Going forward fans could look forward to any promising young players GS has acquired over the last year and KD and klay returning. Klay returning to a fuller form is also a strong possibility. 

I don't know what percentage chance a situation like this has of playing out . But , I don't think it's outlandish and I think that if they hold on to KD and klay that this is a pretty strong move to be better 2 and 3 years from now .

Klay Thompson, although is not a as big as name and reputation as KD, was a Free Agent target for many teams. Klay suffered torn ACL which would likely to keep him out upto the All-star break. Just like  most who suffered torn acl, firt season back is like a rehabilitation process. Giving Klay max would essentially mean you're taking a huge risk more than taking KD inspite of the difference of the injury.

Players like Kemba, Jonas Valenciunas, Tobias Harris, Khris Middleton, D'Lo and even Brogdon are the one who can possibly gain on this.

&amp;nbsp;

- resigning both KD and Klay and keep competing (or resigning Klay and KD opts in): they are basically hard capped, could use the MLE again but it would cost them like an additional 30-40m in luxury tax alone (pending on KDs salary) so they could almost no chance to improve the bench and the 2 newly opened starting five spots AND the vacant center position

they probably cant keep Looney since he a) would be a costly luxury (unless Looney signs for the minimum, which he wont) and b) they rather should adress other needs and sign a center for the min

they would really have to fight for the playoffs and both Draymond and Curry would have to give 100% 36 minutes per night and cant really miss any games (which the again probably wont) - if Currys injured for his typical 8-12 game stretch they basically have no chance of winning anything in that period

they could improve their roster by trading for bench guys and potential starters but that would involve giving up nearly off their available 1st picks for guys on cheap deals / rookie deals 

&amp;nbsp;

- resigning Klay and KD and tanking: this would be crazy, imagine Joe Lacob paying around 250-300m in team salary + tax for purposely missing the playoffs and therefore also wasting a year of Currys prime - but it probably would be effective - this scenario tho is only even considerable if KD resigns long term, they would then have KD, Klay and Curry in 2020 + a fairly high draft pick 

again this scenario is somewhat very unlikely since it just has been done once in history (Spurs tanking for Duncan) but back then the Spurs a) didnt pay luxury tax and b) were almost guaranteed the first pick and with the new lottery odds the Warriors could very much end up with the like 7th pick

- resign Klay and KD leaves: this is probably the absolute worst case scenario since even with KD removed from the books and everyone besides Klay renounced and Livingston/McKinnie waived they have no cap space at all (right at 110m) and again cant get any improvements - only positive is they could use the full MLE 

- let both KD and Klay walk: again this is totally up to KD so they Warriors cant decide on their own to take this direction and its also highly unlikely due to the recent and past statements from Warriors officialls and their general approach towards the team

It was easily the highest motor series performance by any player ever. Not just in terms of scoring, but defense, rebounding, and facilitating as well.

He's the only player ever who can embody almost every role on a team throughout the course of a night. 2013 Lebron, in my estimation, is the single best version of any basketball player ever.

Yes, Jordan has the ability to make amazing passes, but it didn't play well into his skill set, which is why Pippen was the primary playmaker for the Bulls.

From DraftExpress:

""Defensively, Green has some very good things going for him mainly his terrific timing and soft hands, things that allow him to contribute significantly in terms of making plays on the court and getting his team extra possessions. He's an excellent rebounder (12.3 per-40p), particularly on the defensive end, and gets quite a few blocks (1.5 per-40p) and steals (1.9 per-40p) thanks to his ability to anticipate with his terrific feel for the game.

.

**Unfortunately, Green's physical limitations make it quite difficult to project him as being anything more than a liability on this end of the floor in the NBA. His lack of size means he's quite easy to post up and just shoot over the top of even at the NCAA level, and his poor lateral quickness makes it tough to envision him being able to guard most power forwards on the perimeter or even less likely small forwards, which his height suggests he'd have to. This will be a major hurdle for Green to overcome, and it's not quite clear whether a NBA team will be able to get past this issue, despite what he contributes in various other facets of the game.""**

.

This is his coach Tom Izzo though before the draft:

“He may be the best player in college basketball because of what he does. I mean, I know Kentucky, I know Kansas; I know the players they’ve got. But if you talk about a guy that does more things, and we don't even get to the leadership stuff because coaches can't, media people voting around the country can't understand that, can't see that, they're not in the places where that happens.

.

**“When you talk about defense, I'd be the first to tell you, he's not our best defender, but he might be by far our best cerebral defender, understanding the things, reminding guys who is going where, knowing all five positions. I think I've had some pretty good guys at that. I don't think I've ever had a guy like him. “So when you talk about a valuable guy, this kid has done it all.”**

.

All things considered, Green falling to 35 probably worked out best for him. But the point I'd like to discuss is that Draymond was statistically an excellent college player with high intangibles who dropped to the 2nd round due mainly to stereotypes of the body type a PF or SF should have.

It is unlikely because 

1. Kevin Durant is out now completely 
2. Toronto has home court for game 7 
3. For almost all of the series, Toronto has looked like the better team.

Even with all this said, you NEVER know with Golden State. They could get hot any minute. They will 

1. Be playing motivated and angry due to Kevin Durant's injury 
2. Have home court for game 6 
3. Have the momentum going into game 7 (if necessary) 

So there is a chance that Golden State comes back and wins the series. Putting in my personal bias I hope this is not the case, but I will be objective and stay open. It's fair to say that there will not be many differing opinions. In these situations, a general consensus or hivemind/circlejerk emerges. The media along with fans in general are very reactionary. We see it on the other sub all the time. After the Cavaliers completed their 3-1 comeback, this was the following response I had gathered: 

1. Stephen Curry became the most hated player (until July 4th)
2. The Warriors fanbase was accused of all being bandwagons 
3. Many people started to believe Kyrie Irving was better than Stephen Curry 
4. Although in my estimation he is the 2nd or 3rd greatest player of all time, many were saying LeBron James had passed MJ 
5. The Warriors were now accused of being overrated 

I think we may see a similar circlejerk, just on the flip side

1. People will start shitting on Kawhi 
2. The raptors along with there fanbase will become the most hated team by far 
3. People will say this proved a point of Kevin Durant not being needed and being overrated 
4. Stephen Curry will be the Goat PG to many

**When is the optimal time for surgery?**

Preferably 2-3 days

Credit to /u/Jrelis, same thing I was taught in pod school: https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bzvw45/charania_warriors_allstar_kevin_durant_has/eqxj98w?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x

**Why?**

Surgical treatment has historically thought to allow a quicker return to sport and less chance of re-injury within the first year. However, this line of thought is changing with newer functional rehabilitation protocols versus classic serial casting and immobilization. It is taught that conservative treatment is often chosen for older individuals or less active individuals versus athletes at this time. Interesting classic and newer articles talking about the rise in functional, non-surgical rehabilitation with short immobilization times:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4912260/

https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39871

**How?**

Most commonly done as an open surgery. An incision is made adjacent to the tendon for access. The two ends of the tendon are located within the lower leg. A lot of times the ends of the tendon are frayed like a torn string and require clean up. This loss of tissue can be replaced with graft, fascia/aponeurosis that covers muscles, or grafts from less necessary tendons such as the peroneus brevis in the case of chronic ruptures. The tendon is then held together with suture, generally interlocking knots are preferred due to their rigidity and resistance to gapping: http://www.texasorthojournal.org/Vol1_Issue2/03VEURINKetal.aspx

**Then what?**

After surgical repair patients are generally kept in some sort of protective boot or cast with the foot plantarflexed (toes pointing downwards) at 10-30 degrees. 

There is a shift to early rehabilitation and mobilization even post-surgically (see above articles). Patients will begin with gentle range of motion exercises, stretching, and strengthening the rest of the kinetic chain (lying hip abduction, straight leg lifts, etc). Oftentimes an injury in one part of the chain causes more tension to be transmitted to other parts of the chain that must compensate for the loss. They will be encouraged to perform isometric contractions at this time as well and then begin to progress to resisted range of motion to work on strengthening the lower extremity.

Once pain begins to subside patients may begin to weight bear and perform progressive strength and balance exercises starting with just lifting their heels of the ground and progressing to things like balancing with one leg on foam and single leg squats and step ups on a platform, as well as calf raises. 

After these exercises have been performed and patients are in minimal pain with restoration of muscle strength, they begin light activity like intermittent jogging and transition to sneakers, etc. Usually this would begin 3-5 months post-op. Progression from there is on a patient to patient basis depending on what they are returning to activity wise and the physician managing them. RTS factors include measures of functional strength and stability. Many times the strength and biomechanical effects of these injuries can stay for years, so function is important Generally, NBA players have returned at 9 months or later. In KDs situation, he’s likely to miss the entire season or at least most of it.

Just a three-team trade I had an idea of. Who says no?

&amp;#x200B;

**Raptors get: Mike Conley, Joe Ingles, Kyle Korver**

This is only if Kawhi does resign. As important Lowry is to Raptors fans, Mike Conley would be a better point guard and would play better alongside a talent like Kawhi. Getting Joe Ingles and Kyle Korver would also give them two high-quality role players that could help them win (another?) Finals should 

&amp;#x200B;

**Grizzlies get: Dante Exum, Norman Powell**

Ja Morant is most likely their draft choice. Trading Mike Conley for a younger point guard in Dante Exum that could play the backup role if healthy, and also getting a good role-player in Norman Powell, would be great for a team that could be back in the playoffs in the next couple of years.

&amp;#x200B;

**Jazz get: Kyle Lowry, OG Anunoby**

Rubio is gone. Jazz need a point guard, plain and simple. I'm sure many Jazz fans don't want Lowry, but he could definitely provide all-star level scoring and passing for a couple more years if healthy. Getting OG Anunoby would be a big plus also, someone that could develop into a long-term starter easily. He is only 21.

During 1990-91 season, Wilkins averaged 25.9 points on 55.0 TS% while playing 81 regular season games.

In the following season, a 32-year-old Wilkins suffered a season ending Achilles injury after playing only 42 games.

When Wilkins returned for 1992-93 season, he avg. 29.9 ppg on 55.0 TS% while playing 71 regular season games.

From what I know, he's the only superstar player in NBA history to be as brilliant as pre-Achilles injury.

I'll always have tremendous respect for this man.

Having that said.... **Dominique Wilkins never returned to his previous old self.**

Wilkins was forced to change his game after the injury, relying less on his leaping ability and aerial acrobatics. 

His game was now farther away from the basket  developed a more consistent 3-point shot to compensate.

Wilkins in his own words:

&gt;“What the tear does,” he continued, “is force you to play on the ground. You aren’t in the air as much. You become more fundamentally sound. It’s almost like the game slows down in your mind a little bit. And it’s funny, because before the injury, I didn’t really like shooting from outside. I liked attacking the rim, using my quickness to score or get into the paint and find open teammates. But you adjust, and Rudy (Gay) will adjust.""

 -- Herodotus (480BC)

The on going discussion seems to be centered around how critical game 5 was for the Warriors and they were driven to bringing KD back to avoid elimination. However what remains unclear is who to blame and how much. 

Even if KD had not got injured in game 5, bringing him back would not be a good decision. It wasn't just 'hindsight' to say playing him in game 5 was a mistake, the decision was a bad one regardless.

Eg, you could put 40% of the blame on KD for insisting he must play, 40% on management for not vetoing and 20% on medical for not diagnosing the injury correctly in the first place. The logic would go something like: management should be able to say no to KD but supposing they say no, KD being a bitchmade snake would hold that against them in the event he becomes a free agent and holds a grievance against the GSW front office for not allowing him to play, thus the FS felt obligated to appease KD despite the risk of re-injury. 

Now the interesting thing is that KD having become seriously injured, whether or not the GSW should feel obligated to give him a max contract. I don't think so, if it turns out this was a 40% KD decision then he should take responsibility for his decision to make a high risk choice.

Before ABA merged with NBA, it was extremely strong in the 70s where they had top players.

Some all time greats played in the ABA and made the transfer to the NBA at some point. Rick Barry, Julius Erving, George Gervin, Artis Gilmore, Connie Hawkins, Spencer Haywood, George McGinnis, Moses Malone, and David Thompson are all players who are talked about quite a bit who played in the ABA as well as the NBA. 

And even during the 1980s in NBA, Dr J was still excellent during the 1st half of the decade.

Dr. J's career resume looks pretty damn impressive if I'm honest.

&amp;#x200B;

Try to sign good players for short contracts (1-2 years). Maybe try to push for an 8th seed. People like Bojan Bogdanovic, Al Horford, JJ Redick, Julius Randle. 

&amp;#x200B;

Players that are GOOD. Maybe some older ones like for instance Al Horford and JJ who would be willing to accept shorter contracts if the salary is decent. Bojan Bogdanovic to a solid 3 year deal since he is relatively young. Try to get team-friendly contracts that won't cripple the franchise. 

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially, build through free agency like originally planned but have it be through FA's that can be beneficial to our young guys. People like Bojan can help Kevin Knox with his shooting. Al Horford could help Robinson develop as well. JJ, even though he is a SG, could maybe help Ntilikina and DSJr with their shooting and efficiency.

&amp;#x200B;

Another option that's being thrown around on /r/NYKnicks is just going down the Hawks route and take on bad contracts for more draft picks and go on from there. I'm not totally opposed to that since some of the guys on bad contracts are certainly decent players. 

&amp;#x200B;

An example off the top of my head is that if the Orlando Magic are willing to package Mozgov with their first round pick this year, screw it. We can take the cap hit for one year, and maybe trade a low-end player (maybe Tacko Fall if we draft him? Idk).

Obviously still involved. The team that is the most eager to get AD due to a short championship window

IN

2. Knicks

Do you guys think that the Knicks are out because of KD’s injury? Getting AD would have been a no-brainer if KD and Kyrie came to New York. But now that KD is out it looks like the Knicks getting AD would be a bad idea unless they get Kyrie? Even then they appear to not have the assets to acquire him. For the purpose of this exercise, I assume they are out.

OUT

3. Celtics

All indications are pointing towards Kyrie leaving the Celtics. He seems like he wants to come to the Nets at this point. Without Kyrie, the Celtics trading for AD would also be a bad idea because they will lose a lot of young assets to build around in the future. And only AD isn’t gonna win a championship. So I assume the Celtics are out

OUT

4. Nets

The Nets have come out of nowhere in this whole saga. Due to Kyrie wanting to come to Brooklyn, acquiring AD might be a trade they want to make. However, with KD’s injury, Kyrie may have changed his mind on coming to Brooklyn. But we don’t know for sure. The Nets are a darkhorse in this trade saga and they might go after him IF Kyrie comes to Brooklyn. So we’ll consider them in

IN

5. Clippers

To my knowledge, there really hasn’t been any trade rumours about AD to the Clippers. They definitely have the assets. If Kawhi comes, trading for AD would be a good idea imo. 

IN


So I think that right now it’s the Lakers, Nets and the Clippers that are in the AD trade saga after KD’s injury.

Lakers get: AD, DSJ

**What is the Achilles tendon?**

You have three main muscles in the calf, the medial and lateral gastrocnemius on the surface and the soleus under them, referred to as the triceps surae [image](https://rontherapist.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/14073272_237095860019204_936413939_n.jpg). The Achilles tendon is where those three muscles combine to attach to the heel bone aka the calcaneus [image](https://www.sportsinjuryclinic.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Insertional-Achilles-Tendonitis-Diagram2.jpg). 

**What does the Achilles tendon do?**

When the triceps surae contract, they shorten and pull the heel upwards, called plantarflexion. Plantarflexion is important for walking, jumping, running, etc. and is where the power to push off comes from. The opposite of plantarflexion is dorsiflexion, where the heel comes down and the toes go up in the air. Dorsiflexion is what stretches the triceps surae and the Achilles tendon. 

**How does the Achilles rupture, classically?**

The Achilles tendon is incredibly strong and resilient. It normally ruptures under high load. In most cases this is when someone is trying to push-off/plantarflex as the ankle is strongly dorsiflexing. For example, f someone is planting their foot and the heel is coming to the ground, but at the same time they are trying to push off (jump, change directions, etc.). The heel is moving down towards the ground with high velocity, but the calf muscles are trying to pull it back up to come off the ground. This push and pull on the tendon will cause immense load and can lead to partial tears or a rupture.

Think about a rubber band. If someone is pulling it one direction and you suddenly try to pull against them with all of your strength it’s likely going to snap. 

Classic literature says that the Achilles tends to tear in the “watershed” area. This is a few cm above where it attaches to the heel bone. Watershed means an area with decreased blood flow and thickness, which predisposes the area to tears.

**Why are people saying that the trainers/doctors probably knew it right away in the locker room?**

You can do a Thompson test. Have the patient lay on their stomach and hang their feet off the table. Squeeze the calf to simulate a contraction. If the Achilles is ruptured, it can’t pull the heel and plantarflex the foot. [image](https://litfl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Thompson-Test-1962.jpg)

Other tests include just asking the patient to plantarflex on their own. Different variations of tests like the Thompson test. A palpable defect in the tendon or noticeable swelling and loss of visualization of the tendon [image](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/tarupture-140227012909-phpapp02/95/tendoachilles-rupture-and-its-management-13-638.jpg?cb=1393464613).

**Can a strain (tear) of the calf muscles lead to this injury?**

Likely not. If someone had a tear in the muscle belly of the calf, they’d have pain and likely not be able to put that high stress load on the tendon. It’s likely that KD’s “lower calf strain” was actually some sort of minor Achilles tendinopathy (injury) to begin.

**Why I don't think it's a full rupture**

https://imgur.com/a/GBXZuGu

I did notice the KD was able to kind of plantarflex his foot when he was on the ground and even walking off the court which might be indicative of a less severe injury, maybe a partial tear.

This is a conversation of who the better basketball player is. 
The argument: Michael Jordan got to play with Scottie Pippen. Essentially the LeBron of the 90's. This is the reason the Bulls were favored going into every finals. They had the best scorer(Mike) and best all around player(Scottie), in the era before superteams. Any assemblage of decent role players was enough to make that duo a title contender. Mike was a pure scorer and facilitating did not fit well into his skill set as far as making the Bulls a winning team, which is why he couldn't win without Scottie and which is why Phil Jackson made Pippen the primary playmaker within the offense. And contrary to popular belief, Pippen was the one who guarded the best opposing player not Mike. In the 1991 NBA finals after Magic torched Mike in game 1, Scottie guarded him the rest of the series.  This is why I find it laughable that people think MJ could lock down LeBron. LeBron is better than Jordan because he takes on the role of Jordan and Pippen on a nightly basis, especially in his Miami run. He is his teams primary scorer and playmaker, and could legitimately lock up 1-5(2013 Lebron guarded Parker/Kawhi/Duncan all while being the primary scorer and facilitator). Yes LeBron had played with some great players(Wade, Bosh, Kyrie, Love) but none of those players bring to the game what PIppen brought. Pippen is one of the best defenders ever, could create his own shot, and was an elite facilitator. He finished 3rd in MVP voting when Mike left to play baseball. To understand how good Mike really had it, imagine if LeBron and Kd played on the same team(best scorer and best all around player), yea they'd win the championship almost every year. This is essentially why the Bulls were unbeatable and ultimately why Jordan is 6-0. Granted, with a good roster Jordan still would have a few chips even without Pippen, but it wouldn't be 6. Jordan is still the best clutch player ever, but putting him in the same sentence as LeBron is absolutely laughable. The fact of the matter is that at his peak, no other player is capable of doing what LeBron does on the court.

KD injured his calf May 9th, basically one month ago.
We dont know if he had a small tear  ie grade 1 or  a strain with no tear.  The management for a grade one tear is basically over 3 months for normal humans, however in the professional sporting world, they can perform miracles, and they did to get him back on the floor.

We saw him elevating for 3's and even a pretty big dunk in his warm up.  Believe me, to have the confidence to do that, means he had rehabbed very well.  Even after rehab, there is lingering lack of confidence in a healed calf, however KD seemed to put that all behind him, suggesting he has been training well and was confident.

Here is the rub.   you need KD for 3 games if you are going to win. so what did the warriors screw up

1. OVERPLAYED: KD injured at the 10 min mark of the second qtr.  thats 14 mins of gametime.  after 1 month out, and injected into a closeout game of the finals, he had played 12 mins out of possible 14.  That is blatant mismanagement of a returning injured player.  he did not have the conditioning for this, and fatigue on injured muscles leads to injury.  This was an unnecessary risk.

2. USAGE and AWARENESS of ROLE and INJURY:  KD had a calf injury which was healing.  He is coming back before he is ready,  to help the team.  He was not completely healed but was taking a risk.  That was the situation and it needed to be worked around.  ie  it is not ""KD"" coming into the game, it is an rehabbing calf injury , out of game shape KD returning.

what can he do which reduces the risk of reinjury.... 
a. avoid excessive force on calf, ie  NO contact esp in the post, NO 1 v 1's
b. shoot jumpshots in as controlled setting as possible.  his affect on drawing defence would be profound, 
c. get thru the game , aiming for next game to gradually increase impact.  if this is not working from a scoreboard perspective, stay on the bench.

3. ICE ? after warming up
after warming up, and playing the first qtr, getting the muscle nice and warm, why are you on the bench with ICE.  I must admit when i saw him put the ice on , i figured he was out for the game .  how does he get back on the floor after putting ice on an injured calf.  you dont ice a muscle that is injured and then jump into a finals game.  moments later, he reinjured.

This situation could have been manged better.....

1. reduce minutes
2. reduce role, use as decoy and spot up shooter, team and player advised NOT to exceed these limitations
3. aim for 3 game ramp up, not  playing 12 of 14 minutes in first game in one month with a healing injury.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,45233,public,self,KD was mismanaged by the warriors.

These centers difer from one another in terms of their play style.

An injured cousins loves to strech the floor and power his way inside the paint. He is not athletic anymore and gets way less rebounds than he should be. His upside amonst other center in the roster is his ball handling and passing.

Kevon Looney is a stable center that fits the warriors system. A guy that is strong defensively and can't be beaten easily in Pick and roll situations which cousins certain lacks of. He is a decent offensive rebounder and also sets good screens.

Andrew Bogut is a very smart center who likes to play underneath the basket to be the recipient of an extra pass courtesy of PnR of Steph and Draymond. He is slightly more mobile than Cousins but he lacks offensive threat to be in the final minutes of any close out games. He plays decent defense to opposing centers.

Jordan Bell is a failed experiment for the next Draymond Green of the franchise. He is the most athletic and fastest center in the roster but he lacks the Basketball IQ needed to be take his game in the next level. Being good at blocking on the weakside of any opponent and running the in break is the only thing that is keeping him on an NBA Roster. He also have the most weak hands among all centers in the roster as he tends to drop every single pass given to him.

Certainly Warriors right now doesn't need a true bigman who will be filling up huge minutes as their system doesn't require that at all.

Kawhi is currently averaged 31/7/4 on essentially 50/40/90 splits across 22 games. It's also important to consider who he has played against, Milwaukee and Philadelphia being quite good teams.

To put this into context, last year Lebron put up 34/9/9 on 54/34/75 across 22 games against Indiana, Boston, Toronto and Golden State. I'd say that Kawhi definitely had the harder route going to the finals, though his numbers are slightly less spectacular.

This fills David Griffins requirement of an All Star, young player with all star potential, and two picks. I'm not sure their is a better package he can get unless they go to Detroit and replace Beal with Griffin, or hit up Denver for Gary Harris, Barton, and MPJ. This opens up a max slot for Denver, but it doesnt seem like enough for NOLA.

Lakers will get to keep Kuzma in this scenario and receive AD and a shooter in Moore. They will have 6 players under contract with committed salaries of 88 million (Luol Deng's 4.9 million included). They'll have around 21 million left over to fill out the rest of their roster.

Wizards get this because with the 4th pick, Lonzo, and Hart, i think they'll have a good foundation if/when they decide to completely rebuild. I think that 4th pick belongs to Culver, and I personally believe that hes just a good a prospect as Ja and RJ.

Hey everyone - we got a recent update that Michael Porter Jr. has been dealing with “foot drop” after multiple back surgeries and will wear a brace for summer league.

This allowed him to conserve more energy for offense. Then KD came along, and LeBron could no longer relax on defense.

In the 2019 Finals, Kawhi has been guarding Iggy/Dray. If he ends up defending KD, he'll also lose more energy on offense. 

Even though KD is going to be hobbled, I don't think it'll impact him too much on offense, honestly. It's not like he's running around like a guard. His midrange jumper should still be money as always as long as the Warriors can get him into his spots.

However, his defense might be an area for concern. He'll likely be guarding Siakam, right? Do you think a hobbled KD will be able to guard him? Will the Raptors attack KD on defense?

The box-and-one obviously won't work when Steph can pass it out to Kevin Durant instead of Klay Thompson. Steph should have a greater opportunity to succeed on offense as a result.

The game video is at [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V79dfs_1sFo&amp;feature=youtu.be) (it's 2.5 hours long so plan accordingly), and we'll start it today at exactly 5:00:00 pm Pacific Time using this clock ([PT clock](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/usa/seattle)), so even if you show up late, you should be able to use the clock to advance the video to the right spot. I'll set up a game thread for comments on r/VintageNBA around 4:30 where we can all react to and discuss the game together. 

I hope to see as many interested people as possible then!",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,43192,public,self,"JOIN US TODAY TO WATCH GAME 5 OF THE 1976 FINALS ONLINE (""The Greatest Game Ever Played"") AND COMMENT IN THE GAME THREAD -- 5:00pm PT (8:00 ET)",0,1560373045,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/bybmks/join_us_today_to_watch_game_5_of_the_1976_finals/,,,,,,,,,,

Theres no room for error, the Raptors have just taken two games off of your home court, and two of the remaining three games will be away.

In general people might think KD and Kyrie should be the obvious choice. Thing is it isn't always about talent on paper. Kyrie is for my opinion is very mysterious and see him as someone with an ego and might not just fit with KD who rleeis a lot on iso scoring, but our system. 
   My case is this. KD wants to be the best in the world. He went to GS to make his own legacy and he most likely will win two rings and only lost one time. I know majority of the time you need stars to win but why not prove to the media you can do something Lebron hasn't done. Win a ring or come close without superstars like Curry or Wade. I know people think D lo is overrated and I'm a bit biased, but I believe our story was incredible. We have guys like Levert who people like more than D lo and great depth like Din and Harris. KD going there a lone can be a great challenge and the Nets can very well be top three in the east and even better if D lo and Levert take leaps. I watched a clip of the Herd and Broussard talked about if KD followed Kyrie to BK he would look a bit bad or even more. KD needs to just stop being insecure and take a challenge and play for himself. He won two rings and if GS loses his decision looks less bad tbh.

  I still would love a KD and Kyrie tandem and I'm getting more excited for it when I think about it. But even as a Nets fan I have really wanted D lo on this team and rooted for him even when we got him fro longtime Net Brook. KD can prove to the NBA that he can win without the help he went for and that he can truly be better than guys like Kobe or Lebron.

Grouped into (subjective) loose tiers - I guess it would break down something like: max, $15M+, $10M+, etc.  Obviously I don't know every player and I probably missed/mistiered a bunch.


As tier 2 is pretty thin, looks to me like a lot of guys are going to overpaid by the teams that hoarded cap space after they miss out on the top tier FAs - a lot of these guys invariably stay with their current teams. 

Beyond Green and Davis, next year's free class is headlined by the likes Reggie Jackson and Bogdan Bogdanovic so teams would probably wise to overpay this year unless they want to wait 3 years to save a few million.

But people are saying if the Dubs are down 3-2, or even 3-1, and KD comes back, that the Dubs will win for sure.

Last time I checked, a fully healthy Dubs squad lost 3 games to the Rockets last year, 2 games to the Clippers this year, and 2 games to the Rockets this year.

Frankly, they should've lost a game against the depleted Cavs last year as well if not for JR's boneheadedness.

The Raps are significantly better than the Clippers, probably even with the Rockets from last year (and definitely better than the Rockets this year), and definitely better than the Cavs from last year.

To me, even if KD is back (let's say 80%), with the Dubs needing to figure out how to reintegrate him back into the lineup and adjusting away from their ball movement style, I don't see how they could win. Even if the series is tied 2-2 and KD comes back, I just don't see the Dubs pulling it out.

Figured this was worth posting since it's been such a big factor of these Finals. I think most of us expected Klay to return but I doubt he's close to 100%. He'll likely spend a lot of plays spotting up in the corner. Much needed for the Warriors but I don't think he'll be running off screens like he usually does. It'll also be interesting to see how Kerr uses him defensively.


Looney may not be out indefinitely so at least that's something. I doubt he returns unless the series goes deep though. Wouldn't get my hopes up if I was a Warriors fan but it might be factor if they force a game 6 or 7.

One part of this conversion is the anecdotal observation that the team has had ""good injury luck in the playoffs"" until now throughout their run, an observation that typically includes an allusion to the fact that Curry does have a significant injury history overall in his career. So there's a sense from this perspective that things are just evening out from a statistical perspective; and on that same anecdotal level, this _feels_ valid to me, or at least plausible - obviously, it's purely a Gambler's Fallacy to think that they were ""due"" for a run of injuries because they hadn't had any big ones recently, but the notion that if you treat their championship run as a whole this amounts to a regression to the mean (perhaps not in a rigorous sense, but you know what I mean, a return to expected rates) makes some sense.

So my question is not so much is this true or false (though if someone can just roll out a clearly quantified answer great) but how would you go about investigating this idea in a rigorous way? I haven't done deep NBA stat analysis before, and so my quick attempts to dig up some relevant numbers to compare quickly ran into a bunch of dead ends of not knowing where to even find the available data to decide what numbers to compare. It seems like you'd want to do something like ""playoff games missed by starters (or rotation players, defined somehow) for every team that ends up in the Finals"", perhaps normalized against the number of playoff games they actually play in each run. Establish what the statistical norm is, and see where the Warriors are relative to that both now and before this season's run...

(Zhaire Smith, PJ Dozier, Tony Bradley, Wade Baldwin, Angel Delgado, Lonnie Walker IV, Theo Pinson, Chris Boucher)

&amp;#x200B;

**Now let's cover 3 players who I believe could be rising stars as we enter the new decade.**

Here's what I mean by that: the 8 players mentioned before have an enormous amount of potential but right now we are betting on potential with them. 

These 3 players we'll be discussing today are up a tier in talent right now (all 8 players mentioned before were outside of my top 390 players). They've proven a little more, enough to where they are a step or two up on the success ladder.

In my opinion a couple of these players are obvious, the 3rd player isn't as much. Let's have some fun:

&amp;#x200B;

**Anfernee Simons (Portland Trail Blazers)**

The way Portland handled Simons' development in year 1 was very intriguing. Portland only allowed him to play 4 G-League games (17 PPG in those 4) and decided it would be better for him to ride the bench and learn from Damian Lillard + company instead of letting his feet get under him.

Even during the season, this was noticeable and I disagreed with this decision. Then Simons got a chance to shine in his last game and oh man this kid could be something special.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtUlg3Kfu6o&amp;t=163s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtUlg3Kfu6o&amp;t=163s)

He scored 37 points with De'Aaron Fox guarding him most of the time. He showed an arsenal of a smooth offensive game combined with the knowledge he's clearly learned from getting a 1st hand look of watching Damian Lillard play.

*Only 4 other players have ever scored 37 points or more as a teenager:*

LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony

Yes, good company. The record for most points ever scored as a teenager? 

Cliff Robinson, who scored 45 points two days before he turned 20 in March 1980.

Simons turns 20 two days from today. With Portland's roster situation, I would be shocked if he weren't getting exclusive 2nd string opportunities next season. The bench for the franchise improved drastically from the previous season but still needs work, Simons has shown the scoring ability to give this team that made the Western Conference Finals an exciting gigantic boost desperately needed.

&amp;#x200B;

*Again, I want to emphasize, the ceiling is the absolute highest I think a player can go and it's up to them to reach that.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Ceiling:** *If the playmaking progresses at a higher than normal rate for a player of his ability,* ***top 30 overall, multiple time all star, could be the face of a franchise whether it's Portland or elsewhere.***

&amp;#x200B;

**Robert Williams III (Boston Celtics)**

When your giving Anthony Davis problems as a rookie, eyes are going to be opened.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7\_8wUYSm8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7_8wUYSm8)

I mean there are very, very, very few NBA players who have the ability to block Anthony Davis's jumpshot with ease like Williams' does during the above video. 

RWIII was considered a potential (even likely) lottery pick for 2017 before returning to college one more season. Although he didn't get picked until the end of the 1st round, he eased into a fortunate situation with a franchise willing to develop him the proper way.

Which I believe the Celtics' are doing an excellent job of so far. I don't think RWIII was ready for extended prime time minutes as a rookie, but he should be next year.

6'10 with ridiculous athleticism and wingspan, efficient from the field (71% FG PCT), potential to be one of the best shot blockers in the entire league, I wouldn't be surprised if he was the starting C for the Celtics by 2021. For now, in continuing his progression and visualizing Boston's big man rotation last year, he should be the 2nd string C behind Al Horford next year.

**Ceiling:** ***Top 80 overall,*** *one of the most effective defensive energy forces of the 2020's.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Antonio Blakeney (Chicago Bulls)**

The last 3 players on this list aren't going to be as obvious as Simons/RWIII. Those two were 1st round rookies who were picked there for a clear reason.

The remaining discussion will center around 3 guys who, although the hype isn't raining down upon them right now, I truly believe could be extremely effective NBA players who could be remembered as important players in the 2020's decade.

When reviewing Blakeney, no player has improved their reputation in my eyes more so far than when watching his game. Such an impression was made that I moved him up 50+ spots on my overall ranking.

Part of this perception could have been the rumor early in the season that Blakeney cursed out Fred Hoiberg (a rumor Blakeney flat out denied). The dude can flat out score though, and that's the bottom line.

More importantly, he showed he can score on an efficient + consistent basis over the course of an entire season (40% 3 PT in 57 games). When he's on, he can be an emotional spark plug that pumps his entire team up.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTrrGnauceg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTrrGnauceg) 

The downside of that wave is that there is a downside, but I'm not kidding when I say this: If I were a playoff contending team I would take a serious look at him to bring firepower on the 2nd unit. 

Blakeney would be a better fit for a team going for a playoff contention right now than a tanking franchise. His demeanor + skill set could make him a low key great addition for a team that desperately needs a rotational scoring spark. 

He can give that, he improved clearly in all areas on the court from year 2 to year 1 which is a crucial sign for development, and given the right opportunity I think he could make a serious name for himself.

1) They need this win today. The warriors are missing several important pieces and with Klay not 100% a loss today is going to be demoralizing.

2) Lowry needs to step up. He is great even without his shot and while drawing charges, setting screens, and making hustle plays are important he needs to put up some points. The Warriors are going to give more minutes to Cousins and he needs to attack DMC hard. FVV did a good job of this  and you could tell DMC was gassed which is understandable. 

3) They can't give up easy points in transition. They can't ball watch. They need to make GS work hard every possession. Most importantly they can't let the warriors go on a 3rd quarter run. 

4) With Klay questionable GS loses a great defender. This is huge for the Raptors and they need to take advantage. There were stretches where GS put Klay on KL, slotted Dray to guard Lowry who has't been a threat making it easy for Draymond to help, and Iggy was Siakam. Klay is much better at slithering past screens giving Leonard less time to operate but with him questionable...GS loses a big chunk of offense and defense.

Also was I the only one who thought the Raptors weren't switching as much in the last game? 

Warriors

1) GM2 was a big win but they took some big losses as well. Kerr has a nightmare to deal with but also has the opportunity to showcase his coaching. He had the luxury of having a healthy warriors team for 4 years but let's see what he can make of when the odds are not in his favor. 

2) Even if Klay does play I don't think Kerr is going to risk big minutes out of him. This is their 5th Finals appearance and the players are in their 30s. This is going to hurt their offense. Klay kept them in the game till he got injured. Curry, Draymond, and Cousins are going to be seeing a lot of minutes. 

I think they are going to have Cousins in high post and run the offense but from what I say it felt like he had a great chemistry with Klay. Who has cutting a lot and finishing at the rim. Draymond needs to take over that role. 

3) Their bench made some big buckets. I don't know much about Cook but it looked like he wasn't afraid to take big shots and make them but the Raptors will be keeping an eye on him. The Raptors *might* bring out Box-1 defense here and there depending on if Curry is hot and the lineup on the floor and Kerr is going to ready for this so it's not going to be an issue. 

4) Finally how will Kerr play this? He can't afford to double KL. Curry is going to be hounded. He lost a big who could protect the paint and not be a liability on the perimeter. He has a star who is questionable and has to decide if he is going to risk him or hope to put up a big fight and hope Klay/KD are ready for GM4...

Personally I think the Raptors are going to get this win. I think the refs really threw them off the rhythm early and they gave up a big run in the 3rd which I don't expect them to do it again.

Most of their early picks were players from the 90s and prior and it made me wonder how league has changed and who the new faces and leaders of the nba are. 

It’s been almost two decades since the 90’s and in that time we’ve seen a lot of players start, finish and reach the peak of their careers. 

So my question is simple in your opinion what would the best dream team from  2000-2019 look like?

A few stipulations: 

1) This isn’t the best players at each position, so thinking about how the players would play and what kind of system you would play them in matters. 

2) This team or teams would be playing across an entire season and playoffs. So essentially if all of the teams we think of were in the same league which would be best

3) Feel free to give not only your starting 5 but also another 5 you would play in rotation in the spirit of the afore mentioned 10 round fantasy draft.

It had 3 overtimes, a massive comeback, numerous clutch moments in the final seconds of multiple periods, a court storming at the wrong time, tons of controversies, all sorts of role players and Hall Of Famers stepping up big, a bizarre intentional technical to set-up a buzzer-beater ... it had A LOT of drama. **This Saturday, June 8, at 5:00pm PT (8:00pm ET) a group of NBA fans will be watching it together online, along with a Game Thread for commenting.** Here's how it will work:

**1)** The game is posted in its entirety on Youtube at [this link](https://youtu.be/V79dfs_1sFo). I'm a bit of a luddite so someone recommended I show this video through some site online that has built-in commenting capability, but I looked into it and that site required email log-in for everyone, so I'm passing on that. We're going to watch it straight off of Youtube, all hitting play at the same time (again, I'm not a tech person so that's my solution).

**2)** We will hit play on Saturday at 5:00:00 pm Pacific Time using [this clock](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/usa/seattle) so we're all watching it at the same time. Even if you come in late, you should be able to sync up with us easily by using this clock and the video's timer. Keep in mind the game is 2-and-a-half hours long, so plan accordingly. 

**3)** I will start a Game Thread for it 30 minutes or so before we start watching the game, so maybe around 4:30 PT. I am the moderator of r/VintageNBA, a sub for discussing and learning about old-school NBA (loosely defined as pre-2000). The Game Thread will be on that sub. I have been given permission by the mods here to post this event and a little bit of info about my sub. 

**CONTEXT FOR THE GAME** (it's OK: no game spoilers)

**4)** For the Suns to even make it to this point was simply incredible. On January 29, they had lost for the 17th time in their previous 21 games, falling to 18-27, last place in their division. They improved and eventually went 9-4 to end the season and barely earned a spot in the playoffs with a 42-40 record. From there they beat the 43-39 Sonics in Round 1 (*no big deal*), and then went onto the WCF where they should have been smashed by the defending champion, heavy-favorites-to-repeat Warriors who were 59-23…. 

**5)** In the WCF, the underdog Suns barely won 3 of the first 6 games in the series by an average margin of victory of 4 points, before Golden State’s [Rick Barry quit on his team in Game 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/VintageNBA/comments/bp7x8z/on_this_date_may_16_1976_rick_barry_allegedly/), allowing “The Sunderella Suns” to make it to the Finals against the 54-28 Celtics. Part of the reason the Suns got so hot late in the season &amp; could even make things get to this point is that one of their top-2 players was rookie Alvan Adams, who was the Rookie of the Year and an All-Star with one of the most uniquely well-rounded rookie campaigns ever (19/9/6/1.5/1.5), and his play improved as the season went on. He was actually [the star of Game 3 of the Finals](https://www.reddit.com/r/VintageNBA/comments/bunh9q/on_this_date_may_30_1976_rookie_alvan_adams_lead/) which kept the series from becoming a Boston blow-out. 

**6)** The Finals seemed like they’d be a run-away for the Celtics. They had the vastly better regular season record (*54-28 vs. 42-40*), they won it all in ‘74, and had the league’s best record in ‘75 at 60-22 (*Phoenix was 32-50 in ‘75*). The Suns, on the other hand, were barely in the playoffs, let alone the Finals. Boston won each of the first 2 games by double digits, then the Suns eked out victories at home by 7 and 2 points in Games 3 and 4.

The next player in the list with a lower rate than Kawhi is Julius Randle. 

The first 3 players below 4 assists among non-centers in the list are Kawhi, Jordan Clarkson and Emmanuel Mundiay.

All 3 of the above players not only have significantly lower usage than Kawhi (30% is almost 1/3 and 25% is 1/4) but they also play ~7 (~20%) less minutes than Kawhi.

Not exactly elite company.  

Someone in the other subreddit actually countered with something along the lines of ""it's not a big deal that his assists are low because we usually make 3-4 passes after Kawhi passes"", like he is totally incapable of finding an open man, so I included pass rates as well. 

He is ~150th in the league in the passes per game.

The other interesting thing that's almost immediately apparent is how effective Lou Williams and Demar Derozan are at generating assists in spite of their low pass rates  - they produce an assist every 6.4 and 5.5 passes, compared to a pretty consistent ~10 among most of these players. In ~5 more passes than Kawhi, they almost double his assist output.

Also, anyone able to figure out what the fuck Lauri Markkanen is doing?

By setting ball screens closer to half court, the Warriors paid homage to their Canadian hosts by creating the basketball equivalent of a hockey power play.

2 . Going From Small Ball to Boogie Ball

&gt; Warriors have outscored teams by 13.9 points per 100 possessions in the playoffs when Curry and Green have been in the game without another big man alongside them, per PBP Stats. Especially following Durant’s injury, you’d think that Kerr would lean on this duo as much as possible in the Finals, but Draymond didn’t play a single minute at center in Game 1. Entering Game 2, the expectation was that Kerr would unleash it. Nah. Instead, Kerr featured Green at center for only three minutes (and the Warriors were outscored 8-5) and went about supersizing Golden State’s lineups.

&gt; DeMarcus Cousins started Game 2 and played 28 minutes, tallying 11 points, 10 rebounds, and six assists. Bogut came off the bench and went 3-for-3 from the field in seven quality minutes. Kerr often screws around at the center position, starting Bogut or Jordan Bell over Kevon Looney, who’s his team’s best option there. Starting Cousins seemed like the coach’s next goofy choice. But Boogie’s playmaking in the post quickly made it apparent why Kerr went this direction.

3 . Putting Draymond in Position to Thrive on Help D

&gt; Nurse must find better ways for the Raptors to attack Cousins on defense moving forward, but it’s not like he didn’t try in Game 2. Toronto ran countless pick-and-rolls against Boogie, but the Warriors neutralized their effect by dropping the big man and happily allowing Gasol to shoot from deep. Gasol often hesitated, and even if the Raptors attacked the paint, Cousins had help as a result of Kerr’s other changes.

&gt; The Warriors opened the second half with Thompson defending Leonard, either Iguodala or Draymond guarding Kyle Lowry, and whoever wasn’t on Lowry sagging off Pascal Siakam. It worked wonderfully: Lowry can shoot but is an infrequent cutter, so two defenders as intelligent as Iggy and Green were able to successfully help off the ball to halt other players’ drives, keep track of Lowry, and afford themselves enough time to recover.

Siakam and Gasol combined for 18/14/7 in 72 minutes on 7/25 shooting (0/5 from 3) while Ibaka only played for 16 minutes and he still managed to post 7/10 and 2 steals.

I've been told this is due to foul trouble, which seems like a cop out to me, seeing as half the team was in foul trouble and Ibaka finished the game with 3 fouls. Surely he could played 10 more minutes in the game without fouling out and provided the Raptors with a few extra rebounds then Siakam/Gasol did.

For some context, 14 rebounds in 72 minutes is one every 5 min, 8 seconds. Whereas, Ibaka was getting a rebound every minute and 36 seconds, so even if he wasn't taking the shots they would have had 4 extra scoring opportunities if Ibaka played 10 minutes extra (at the rate he was rebounded).

His older brother plays at Missouri State although there is a strong chance Aminu is a one and done, there is pressure on Missouri State to land the recruit, especially after missing out on Darius Garland (Garland's father was a  star at Mo State, then SMS).  Aminu was recently named the Gatorade Player of the Year for Missouri.  The only other high school sophomore to receive the award for Missouri was Jason Tatum  currently of the Boston Celtics.   

Aminu is a lanky player that should fill out nicely as he matures.  He is already one of the top five players  in Springfield history and should soon take over the top spot if he remains at Greenwood until graduation.  Longtime Greenwood coach has said he's the best sophomore he has seen play (this coach has numerous state final four appearances).  The most likely reigning 'best player from Springfield' is probably Dorial Green-Beckham.  Yes, the same DGB who played for the Titans and Eagles in the NFL.  He was an exceptional high school basketball player with numerous D1 offers and he has a state title under his belt as well.  He could have went the NBA route but for whatever reason went with football - national player of the year honors will do that sometimes.

What do you guys think the Raptors will do differently or adjust? Here's my two cents 

Defensively:

- Know your opponent:: TOR gave up several dunks and layups out of timeouts and set plays (at least 4 I think) ... And several more on backdoor cuts from over-pressing + late help on defense. Understanding when to press on D will be important, and being more familiar with GSWs playbook will help with that 

-Smarter fouls:: Let Steph beat you shooting contested 2pters or going to the basket... GSW made their run last game when TOR fouled away from the rim. Save those for hard fouls to prevent open dunks and layups.

As good as TORs defense was, I think they can be even better. ORebs were an issue in g1 but shouldn't be as much of an issue today, given GSW will probably focus a lot on getting back in transition 

Offensively:

-Get Kawhi/Kyle the ball in different spots:: The warriors weren't letting either of those guys get comfortable or initiate offense. Some solutions could be running Kawhi/Kyle PnRs... Or initiating the offense elsewhere and trying to let Kawhi catch the ball closer to the rim (facing up at the top of the key, baseline etc).

-Rely more on cuts than 3s: Warriors are blitzing and crowding the paint, and TOR settled for open 3s from players that may not be consistent over 7 games. A better option would be to attack the paint, as GSW has basically zero rim protection when they blitz, and Siakam has shown he can finish over the defense when it's not squared up/in scramble mode.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,40440,public,self,What are some tactical adjustments Nurse should make for Game 2?,0,1559679154,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/bvy2yt/what_are_some_tactical_adjustments_nurse_should/,,,,,,,1.0,,,

Rapidly, like never seen before.**

The 2020's will be a Golden Age for the league. A near perfect combination of top level talent + ridiculous amounts of depth will please the casual and hardcore fan alike.

&amp;#x200B;

***Last week we discussed 3 stud muffins on the rise: Tony Bradley, Wade Baldwin IV, Angel Delgado.***

These 5 players discussed are chilling in a higher tier. Whom we discussed last week, they have ridiculous potential that still needs to be realized and have the mindset to do so.

The professionals mentioned today have realized that potential a tiny bit more. I feel very strongly about the positive heights each of these players can triumph in 2019-2020.

Let's get right to it:

&amp;#x200B;

**PJ Dozier (Boston Celtics)**

Let me be the first to say this:

*Do not be surprised if PJ Dozier is the starting point guard for the Boston Celtics next year.*

At the very, very least he should be in the rotation. With Kyrie leaving and I highly doubt the Celtics re-sign Terry Rozier, unless they sign Kemba Walker there is a wide open race for the starting point guard spot. 

Dozier was more than impressive in the G-League this past season: 21 PPG, 7 APG, 7 RPG, solid perimeter defense, good AST/TO ratio (2/1), incredible size + athleticism + length for a player of his position at 6'6.

Here are some highlights of a 37 point/13 rebound/8 assist performance in the G-League back in December:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc2mO5uLXHQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc2mO5uLXHQ)

For a recently having just turned 22 year old at the time, the natural feel for the game is noticeable. 

Another factor is the late great Reggie Lewis is his cousin, Dozier is hungry to prove himself in this organization.

The biggest area of improvement is his shot (31% from 3) his release is a little slow but the mechanics are there. He also put up a 12 point/11 rebound/5 assist game late in the NBA season vs. the Wizards.

*I want to emphasize the future can only tell if these players will reach their ceiling or not.* 

**Ceiling: Top 50 overall NBA player, with a consistent jump shot + continued progression multiple time all star and can etch his name in Celtics' history.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Lonnie Walker IV (San Antonio Spurs)**

The expectation from myself was for LWIV to be the rare rookie to crack the Spurs' rotation and make an immediate impact. If not for a torn meniscus in the preseason he would have.

Stats are good and tell a story (17 PPG in G-League, 44% FG, 36% 3 PT) but the bigger picture is seen by simply watching him play.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybKSWL2SNyc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybKSWL2SNyc)

Here was an opportunity he got late in the season where he put up 16 on the Nuggets. This video currently sits at about 85,000 views and the comments are in awe of his natural ability.

I didn't even look at the comments until right before I typed that and I was as well. The athleticism and IQ are there, personally the most impressive aspect was his uncanny mechanics for a freaking 20 year old. He looked like a veteran role player in that regard, and he's not even 21 yet.

LWIV is one of the more unique personalities in the league and has the right mindset as well:

*“In this family, we don’t fear failure. We have a win-win situation, no matter what it is."" (TheUndefeated)*

A prototypical Spurs' prospect that is further ahead in maturity and development than draft picks' of years past. As long as he's healthy, expect major progression in 2019-2020.

**Ceiling: Low end top 100 player, one of the more consistent + unique SG's of the 2020's.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Theo Pinson (Brooklyn Nets)**

Pinson was one of the more intriguing prospects of the 2018 NBA draft. In basic terms, my evaluation was *""He's great at everything but shooting and that has a long way to go for him to make an impact"".*

Well, he made unprecedented progression with shooting and the other aspects of his game remained great. 

I first was impressed with him in the NBA, but he destroyed the G-League this past season. Led the Nets to the G-League Finals and was Ridiculous Upside's G-League Rookie of the Year. Here are some highlights from a 43 point game he put up in January:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqN8L8U9YVU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqN8L8U9YVU)

His G-League season was eye opening: 20 PPG, 6 APG, 6 RPG. He showed potential role player abilities at North Carolina but he did not show this.

Here's what gets him on this list though:

*4 years at UNC: 26% 3 PT PCT*

*2018-2019: 39% 3 PT PCT*

His game was also noticeable in the NBA (where I first became impressed). Scored 19 points on the Knicks and Brooklyn converted his contract to guaranteed in April.

I would expect him getting consistent minutes in the rotation as the 9th man next year, looking at how Brooklyn used their SG's this past year I'd expect some starts as well.

**Ceiling: Top 120 overall, one of the best role players of the 2020's.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Chris Boucher (Toronto Raptors)**

The story of this young man is absurd.

A dishwasher at 19 years old (never played basketball until he was 18) he was noticed and long story short he's progressed to the point where he was the 2018-2019 G-League MVP and DPOY.

27 PPG, 11 RPG, 4 BPG. Dude was pretty much the Anthony Davis of the minors.

He impressed at times in the big leagues as well. Here are highlights from the last game of the regular season where he put up 15 points/13 rebounds/2 blocks on the Timberwolves:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am1hRd2ux4Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am1hRd2ux4Q)

The block at the :35 second mark is one of the more ridiculous displays of athleticism and natural ability I've seen in the entire 2018-2019 season.

I'd be surprised if he didn't get a bigger opportunity in 2019-2020 (28 GP for Raptors in 18-19). There are some areas for improvement still as well: he still needs to put on 10-15 pounds. AST/TO ratio in NBA and G-League no bueno (2 TO to 1 AST)

He's overcame a lot of obstacles in his life, has continually progressed in his game in (really) the 7 years he's been playing basketball, and I'd expect him on the opening night roster next year.

**Ceiling: Top 140 overall**

&amp;#x200B;

**Zaire Smith (Philadelphia 76ers)**

One of my favorite prospects of the 2018 NBA Draft, I have been on record comparing him to Donovan Mitchell.

His impact in 2018-2019 would have been through the roof if healthy. Unfortunately one of the more bizarre incidents of the season set his progress back as an allergic reaction to a peanut had him hospitalized for 6 weeks with feeding tubes even longer and down to 160 pounds.

That's in the past, here's the deal now:

He's healthy, like fully healthy as far as we know. The fact that he came back from that (and a serious foot injury as well not to mention) even before the season was over is remarkable, arguably the most remarkable comeback considering he played great too.

The G-League was an adjustment, but he took off in the last regular season game in the NBA showing off a glimpse of the future. 

Here was his 17 point/5 assist performance vs. the Chicago Bulls:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLnpMhbmfBg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLnpMhbmfBg)

The athleticism is evident with a play at 1:30. With ridiculous contact from Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, Smith attempts a layup that borderline defies the laws of nature. Although he misses the shot, he quickly gets to the basket for an offensive rebound and puts the ball in the basket.

The really great news: He will still be only 20 years old the whole season in 2019-2020 (turns 21 next June) the 76ers' are essentially getting a rookie. 

His shooting form needs a little work (and is just a tiny bit too eerie to Markelle Fultz) but in 6 NBA games he shot 38% from 3 on nearly 3 3PA a game. I'm not concerned.

Smith is a long term project, but at the least should be in the rotation next year. If he can stay healthy and move in the right direction, I see a steady progression where he could be making a serious, serious name for himself by 2022-2023. Could be sooner.

I thought it wouldn't because the 73-9 Dubs were clearly superior. 

Now, the question is: **Is this Warriors team without KD the same as the one LeBron had to face in the Finals in 2016?**

So, here are my thoughts:

1 - Curry was on a superior level back then, but he looked hurt in the finals. I dont think those two versions of him are on the same level. This year's one is better. 

2 - Draymond and Iggy were better shooters. I don't have the numbers right now, but I remember both of them hitting a lot more open shots than now. That's a big difference. 

3 - Klay looked more consistent and threatning. This is one I definitely don't have the numbers to back me up. You can criticize and expose me for saying this, but now it looks like he isn’t hitting the same shots as before and is more likely to have a bad day than 3 years ago.

4 - They had Bogut to provide great defense inside, to set screens and make good passes. 2016 Bogut is far superior than any center they have now, and that's a big advantage. 

Now, my conclusion would be that the 2016 team was better, but they did had to play one or two games without Bogut and Draymond, and Curry got hurt a few days before the finals.

Imo its the best available guy the rockets could aim for that is realistically available for the right price and think that Griffin would definitely improve their team.

also, as far as the trade specifics go its kinda hard to narrow it down to a tee. on one hand, blake is a 30 pf that just had a all nba season although he has a injury concerns that comes with him. The rockets did offered 4 1st for jimmy butler but I dont think Griffin will garner such a high price. although cp3's contract is a negative in this trade. because of all this ive been thinking 2-4 1st rounders in the ballpark the rockets would have to give up for this trade. how would you guys say this trade sounds (note this trade would have to happen after the draft):

Obviously the Warrior's offense was stymied by the resilience and versatility of the Raps defense last night, and their defense, while accomplishing their goal of keeping Leonard relatively kawhi-et, allowed Siakam a spectacular shooting night in the paint and restricted area, and allowed Gasol to shine as well. There are several questions that I think Kerr needs to answer before Game 2: 

**Offense**

* One of Steph's biggest strengths as a tactical tool in the playoffs is his ability to play centers off the floor utilizing his excellent handles and quick release from 3. The Raps neutralized this by having Gasol trap quickly, and use his length and quick hands to pressure Curry on the ball. Going into Game 2, should Curry simply execute his reads out of the trap more effectively, or are there simply better tactical options than trying to get that 1-5 match up using the Curry-Looney PnR?
* Has Kerr been underutilizing Cousins? Although not entirely healthy, nor effective on defense, perhaps Cousins' comparably respectable jumpshot would force Gasol to guard him on the perimeter as a spot up shooter, giving Curry an easier lane to the basket with any 1-4 PnR action he does with Green. 
* Speaking of Green, he had an underwhelming game offensively (although good on the boards). What can Kerr do to make Green more effective as a playmaker? 
* Second chance points were huge for the Warriors, but their transition defense was terrible. Should they rely on just better ""execution"", or do the Orebs need to be sacrificed to get back sooner?

**Defense**

* Although some of Siakam's dominance was the aforementioned transition, his length and strength in finishing over Green was on full display. What can Kerr do? Is it just better execution and contests on Green's part or is there possibly a better match up (maybe Iguodala before KD returns) to cool down Spicy P? 
* Kawhi's normally spectacular impact was somewhat minimized (although he was still very effective from the line) due to the trapping ""wall"" strategy the Dubs used. Do the Warriors keep sending this help when the role players have been capitalizing on their open shots so effectively?
* Beyond better perimeter rotations, what can Kerr do to neutralize Gasol on offense? Is Looney an adequate solution? 

**Conclusion**

The matchups here are more fascinating than we've seen in a Finals series for a while, and the chess match between Kerr and Nurse looks to be a treat in what could be a competitive Finals even if KD returns less than 100%.

Initially it sounds simple enough but puts a cap on his claim for most improved player in the NBA this past year.  Taking what the defense gives you is an old saying that goes back generations.  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXjMuexQ7s8

A few things are needed for his strategy to work and it goes back to an older saying:  good players take what the defense gives them and are able to do something with it; great players take what they want.  This is not a knock on Pascal but a compliment as a player.  Every player has to get past step one (taking what is given them) to become great.  

To me 'taking what the defense gives you' means the defense is going to deny your greatest strength - whether that's driving to the right or left, whatever.  And being able to recognize what the defense is giving up (maybe the d is giving up a mid range, pull up jumper or just a straight pull up).  Normally it means the d is denying a drive one way or the other; and the d gives up the jump shot (hands down, man down) over the top.  It can mean the d is funneling all drives toward help and giving up anything that direction.  Yet, whatever is being given up by the d is able to be recognized by Siakam and he's developed his game to the point where he can still be effective.  For instance, the d may be giving up a straight shot but is denying the drive.  Pascal is able to recognize this and simply take the shot and be effective. 

It will be interesting to watch Siakam the rest of the playoffs and see what Golden State is giving up.  That may change over the course of the finals.  Perhaps GS decides to start giving up the drive in order to hope for a trap.  Pascal will have to show the ability to take these drives and be productive at being able to pass out of them or simply continue trying to score (drives and pull ups or straight pull ups).  

Either way, the ability to have a viable mid range game is key to all this.  Being able to be a triple threat offensively - especially having a quick and accurate mid range jumper or pull up shot- allows Pascal to take what the defense gives him and do something with it. We'll see Game 2 what adjustments are made by the two sides.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,40200,public,self,"The wise words of Pascal Siakam ""taking what the defense gives me.""",0,1559665705,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/bva4w1/the_wise_words_of_pascal_siakam_taking_what_the/,,,,,,,,,,

I was reminded of the 2004 Playoffs. An eastern conference where no one was positive who was going to come out on top vs a stacked team in the West with two main superstars. Here some some comparisons I see interesting:

-	04 Lakers = 19 Warriors 
-	04 Pistons = 19 Raptors(Great defensive Eastern team) 
-	04 Spurs = 19 Rockets (lost in 6 after tying up 2-2, lost to eventual Champion 2 of last 3 years) 

-	Kobe, Shaq, Malone, Payton  = Curry, KD, Draymond, Klay (Who'd like to see a Malone vs Dray fight)
-	RIP, Rasheed, Billups, Prince = Kawhi, Gasol, Lowry, Siakam(cornrows amirite)
-	Duncan, Ginobili, Parker = Capela, Harden, CP3 (CP3 never gonna get a ring tho) 

 There so some other interesting connections such as the Raptors and Pistons both getting taken to 7 in the Eastern conference semi-finals, with the Raptors winning at home and the Pistons winning on the road.

To do so, I’m wondering a game between the ‘96 Bulls VS 2017 Warriors. 

I would like to know what you guys think about it? Who would you think will be more likely to win this game? Why? Especially with the different kind of basketball played today in the NBA.

The plan has two parts, one for the team and one for players. The players one is simple, they get a bonus depending on where the finish in the tournament. Pretty simple. The teams incentive would work something like this. The first round of the NBA draft would become 31 picks. The winner of the tournament would get a mid lottery pick or maybe even the odds of that pick if you want to incorporate the lottery into this.

So an example could be if a team wins they are locked into the 10th pick and the lottery is done around that pick. Or you could give them the odds that the 10th pick gets now and they would have like a 3% chance at the first pick.

I think that this would be more than enough to get teams to try in this tournament while still keeping league balance intact. Let me know what you think.

If the raptors win, does Kawhi have a case for top 20 all time? I do not like Steph I'm a Lebron fan

&amp;#x200B;

If GSW wins and steph is the finals MVP, he'll have 4 rings and a finals MVP (should be 2, one from 2015), 2 MVP's (one unanimous), leader of a 73 win team (a Draymond suspension away from winning), a million shooting accomplishments and records I won't even get into, and 6x all star/ all nba and counting. I think one could easily make the argument Steph was also the most important player for all 4 title runs, even the years KD won finals MVP. even if he doesn't win a title for the rest of his career, if he makes say 4 or 5 more all star/ all nba teams, can he crack the top 10? I think you could make a case for him against kobe or hakeem. 

&amp;#x200B;

If Toronto wins and Kawhi is finals MVP, he'll be a 2x champion, 2x FMVP, 2x DPOY, 3x all star/ all nba, 5x all defense. Obviously he doesn't have the longevity stats yet, but I think his current peak is better than many players generally considered around the top 20 range, some of whom have no rings or finals mvps. Is Kawhi better than guys like D wade, barkley, KG, Dirk, Isiah Thomas, Karl Malone? I think Kawhi will win an MVP at some point, possibly more DPOY awards, and obviously get more all star/ all nba selections. Toronto's playoff run this year I feel is also underrated. The east this year was probably the strongest it's been in a decade, even with Lebron out. Toronto beat a stacked Philly team with 4 all stars, and Milwaukee with the MVP. The conference also had a stacked boston team, and Indiana (very good with oladipo).",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,38764,public,self,Where will Steph and Kawhi rank all time after this finals?,0,1559654943,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/buqm7y/where_will_steph_and_kawhi_rank_all_time_after/,,,,,,,,,,

Some fun numbers:

* 53% (8/15) of top overall scorers were FMVP, but 80% (12/15) of top winning scorers were FMVP.
* 40% (6/15) of top overall scorers came from the losing team. Half (3) of those instances are LeBron James.
* Average PPG of top overall scorer: 29.2
* Average PPG of top winning scorer: 26.8
* Average PPG of top losing scorer: 25.4
* Highest and lowest top overall scorer: LeBron James (2015, 35.5) and Tim Duncan (2005, 20.6)
* Highest and lowest top winning scorer: Kevin Durant (2017, 35.2) and Tony Parker (2014, 18.0)
* Highest and lowest top losing scorer: LeBron James (2015, 35.8) and TIE between Paul Pierce and Hedo Turkoglu (2010 and 2009, 18.0)

Some observations:

* Win or lose, almost no one outscores LeBron James on his team. The only year (2011) he did not lead his team in scoring, he (17.8) was outscored by Dwyane Wade (26.5) and Chris Bosh (18.5).
* Spurs unselfishness is real, not that you needed me to tell you. All top team scorers are below the respective averages above. Regardless, over this span, Spurs were 3-1 in the Finals.
* Unsurprisingly, Kobe was the top overall scorer in the Finals he played in over this span. Not only that, he scored at least 10.0 PPG more than his next-highest scoring teammate, which was Pau Gasol in all three instances (2010: 18.6, 2009: 18.6, 2008: 14.7).
* Paul Pierce? Better than Dwyane Wade? Over this span, Dwyane posted a higher PPG than Paul's highest (21.8) in 3 of his 5 appearances. The two other appearances were Dwyane's last two appearances in the Finals (2013: 19.6, 2014: 15.2).",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,38706,public,self,Let's talk scorers: NBA Finals top scorers over the last 15 years,0,1559651695,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/bukls1/lets_talk_scorers_nba_finals_top_scorers_over_the/,,,,,,,,,,

A weakness in any of these attributes severely limits their ability to become the BEST and win Rings.

1. Four Level Scoring.

Its not just about scoring alot of points. Its not just about being efficient. Its about being a 4 level scorer. 3-point range. Mid-range. In the Paint. Free throws. If you are missing one or two of these you will be exposed deep into the playoffs. We saw how Giannis was exposed for being a 1 level scorer. And Lebron in the past was also exposed for being a 2 level scorer. The truly great are able to score in all 4 levels with great efficiency. A defense can only take away so much. And a 4-level scorer is almost impossible to contain.

2. Play making

Being able to pass out of double teams. Being able to control pace. Being able to understand what the team needs and when. Being able to make the correct pass and at the correct time. Even the GOAT scorer (Jordan) had to increase his skill at play making to reach the highest level. I think we will see Kawhi hit a glass ceiling in the NBA Finals because of a lack of play making. With strong play making you can punish teams that double you and make others around you better.

3. Defensive Versatility

This is getting more and more important each year. Yes, teams can figure out how to hide players on defense. But ultimately if you want to be the best you need to be good to great on defense. But you can't just be great guarding your own position. With switching and small ball you need to be able to guard multiple positions at a high level. Look at Gobert. He is an all time great rim protector. But his lack of defensive versatility means he can easily be played off the court. A less dominant rim protector like Draymond Green is actually superior on defense because of his versatility. Look at Curry. His lack of size and strength harms his defensive versatility. 

4. Closing

You have to be able to close. You have to be able to be clutch and WANT to take the big shot and make it. This is about attitude and skill. This is really a combination of 4-level scoring and play making but it deserves its own category because the mental side is so important. Look at Giannis. He cannot close. Because of a lack of a jumper he does not have the game to close. Look at Shaq. Because of poor free throw shooting he cannot close. Ultimately most games in the last 2 rounds come down to 1 or 2 possessions. So being able to Close is the difference between Rings and Tears.

Good article on dissecting the match ups in the series. Generally I believe the match ups are fairly even but what can swing the series is what is mentioned below:

&gt; The Raptors have a lot of answers. They have home court. Maybe in getting this far, they shed the mental yips that pockmarked their play at times before the Milwaukee series -- the bouts of hot-potato timidity from Lowry and Gasol.


&gt; But the pressure of the Finals is new, more intense. Golden State has lived it many times over. The Warriors are ready. Part of them is excited to start on the road. After all these years, they crave new challenges.

I would go as far to say that if they shoot like they did on open shots games 1-3 of the ECF they will have trouble. 

Here are my two points of emphasis from the article.

**1**

&gt; To beat even the non-Durant Warriors, you have to be able to switch the Curry-Green pick-and-roll. That is just a fundamental truth now.

The hard part about this one is the Cavs won in 2016 not doing this. They doubled Curry, chose the 3 that weren't HB on the 4 on 3 and prayed HB would miss. Generally I believe switching everything (including off ball) similar to the Rockets the past two years and OKC in 2016 is the best way to defend this version of the Warriors however the teams are still entranced by the doubles when Durant isn't playing - see Rockets at the end of Game 5 and Game 6 this year. If Curry starts tearing the centers up like he did to TT in 2015, 2017 and 2018 and Adams in 2016 then he may force the Raptors into 'letting the other guys beat you' via the Draymond 4 on 3. That will take a lot of the Raptors defense skill out of the equation and lead to more chaos which GSW thrives on.



**2**

&gt; Toronto's role players will need to hit open 3s, though they might not get as many naked looks this time around.

This is really where that game or 2 swing comes into play. If the Raptors shoot like Game 1 through 3 of that Bucks series this will be over fast. If they get 2 of Gasol, FVV, Ibaka or Green hitting close to their season averages it will be closer.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,38675,public,self,"[Lowe] Predicting who wins a tight, tense NBA Finals",0,1559649029,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/bufk5j/lowe_predicting_who_wins_a_tight_tense_nba_finals/,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'SBapxomAbgnPpNnng9kED8ozMrjhZ1AFDMmGBOCl4iI', 'resolutions': [{'height': 60, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/GACF86BrV2X4akwqk9KsC2zyeb7kI5hum0pWpR1FdNI.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fb05ad2bf987dd82ee0a51fba9257a3fa146c22', 'width': 108}, {'height': 121, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/GACF86BrV2X4akwqk9KsC2zyeb7kI5hum0pWpR1FdNI.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f637dac80d5a56c1e60442d1bb1fbc6bd7914236', 'width': 216}, {'height': 180, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/GACF86BrV2X4akwqk9KsC2zyeb7kI5hum0pWpR1FdNI.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88c1b7d2b24dd6bbc5cdab5a2f15fe8222762411', 'width': 320}, {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/GACF86BrV2X4akwqk9KsC2zyeb7kI5hum0pWpR1FdNI.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e743ccd5b7b1173abd3fe47b3e9cbe1f0a51f221', 'width': 640}, {'height': 540, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/GACF86BrV2X4akwqk9KsC2zyeb7kI5hum0pWpR1FdNI.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d421c66970c444b26f982597737663d0a5ea50d6', 'width': 960}, {'height': 607, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/GACF86BrV2X4akwqk9KsC2zyeb7kI5hum0pWpR1FdNI.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1285fd1c8c0ef8ce5eb6b67e55d049b658a9d88a', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 729, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/GACF86BrV2X4akwqk9KsC2zyeb7kI5hum0pWpR1FdNI.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=88cbe5a9fab1655d4c9eb195bc9522ad73787532', 'width': 1296}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,

I thought this might be a good spot to go into more depth, and pick out a few of the most incredible bits from the article.

The point I'm looking to make is that the Lakers' mess-ups were independent and exhaustive. Nearly every person involved in management, on their own, did something incompetent or character-revealing. 

&gt; ""It was shocking,"" said one Lakers coaching staff member who was present. ""If you're going to be in this business, you bring enough pressure on yourself. You don't need more pressure, especially from someone who's supposed to be an ally.""

In the context of Magic's ""we could fire anyone"" when he was first hired. Thought this was a good look behind the curtain to realize how a culture of complacency had taken over the Lakers, even before this mess. While I understand the sentiment, Magic was brought in to shake things up. It appears people were ready to dig their claws in off the bat.

&gt; ""Does Magic Johnson feel betrayed, and if so, by whom?"" Smith asked.
&gt; 
&gt; ""If you are going to talk betrayal,"" Johnson replied, ""it's only with Rob.""

Incompetent and immature. You're grown ass men airing this out over First Take rather than with the Buss family or 1on1. Baffling.

&gt; In November, NBA commissioner Adam Silver and Maverick Carter, LeBron's longtime business partner, met for lunch. James' agent, Rich Paul, was seated at a nearby table, and at one point, approached Silver to complain about Walton, multiple sources familiar with the interaction told ESPN. Paul said he didn't believe Walton was the right coach for the Lakers. Silver shrugged off the remark and asked whom Paul thought would be the right coach. Paul suggested Tyronn Lue.

IMO, this is the most mind-boggling part of the article. We get a pretty clear picture of the ways LeBron tears at an organization's seems and bends them to his will. This is such a gross ploy, and one that doesn't even make all that much sense from LeBron and his team. Going to the commissioner to get your coach fired or drum up controversy? 

Ending with ""he wanted Ty Lue"" is fucking perfect. Fuel to the fire that LeBron just wants a yes-man.

&gt; For example, three people close to James are listed in the Lakers' staff directory as employees: Robert Brown, whose title is personal security officer; Randy Mims, whose title is executive administrator, player program &amp; logistics; and Mike Mancias, whose title is athletic trainer &amp; athletic performance liaison. All three were also on the team payroll with James in Cleveland.

Comedy

&gt; Paul didn't deny to ESPN that he had ridden on the Lakers' team charter, though he said he also did so while James played in Cleveland and Miami. Sources who rode on those team charters while James played there dispute that claim.

One of the big takeaways from this article are that agents are lying scumbags. And they do it effortlessly. Maybe this is a ""Get off my lawn"" moment, but I can't see how sicking these types of guys on 18-year-olds is a good idea.

&gt; And so the perception existed among the Lakers' coaching staff that Paul sought to oust Walton. And some players also believed, according to coaching staff members and those players' agents, that Klutch Sports was working to trade them away for a superstar. Given those perceptions, one former Lakers player described Paul's presence on the team charter as a ""culture killer.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""Coaches know Rich is trying to get them fired, and players know Rich is trying to get them traded,"" said one agent with ties to the Lakers, who called Paul's presence on the plane ""destructive.""

I mean, anyone who's followed the NBA for the last 10 years could tell you this. He did it with Cleveland, he did it with Miami, he did it in Cleveland again, and yeah, of course he did it with the Lakers. Everyone not blinded by their admiration of Bron or LA said this at the time. 

We should probably expect Windhorst to go on TV this week and say how LeBron doesn't do things like this. Mouthpiece gonna mouthpiece.

&gt; ""I understand my position. I respect all those in our industry. At the end of the day, all I can do is continue to do a job for my client. That's it. I can't worry about what somebody thinks, the perception. All I can do is work hard and continue down the path that I'm on.""

Agents are soulless creeps.

&gt; Said one Lakers front-office staffer: ""What wasn't in good faith? We proposed something and they turned it down. It's very arrogant on our part.""

Again, something that I think most neutral fans realized at the time. Magic was just throwing a tantrum. The whole situation was unfair and BS for the Pelicans. The media of course helped perpetuate this.

&gt; In the office, the staffer apologized and later, off site, began to cry, according to multiple people with knowledge of the incident. In the months ahead, she would suffer increased anxiety and panic attacks. She was prescribed anti-anxiety medication, quit the Lakers after more than two decades with the team, and began several weeks of therapy, multiple people familiar with the matter said. She gave her notice on Dec. 18, 2017, the same day Kobe Bryant's two jerseys were retired.

This jumped out at me. I really would like more details on that. It seems like Magic over-reacted, but getting chewed out and let off with a warning doesn't feel that severe. Either something else had to go on here, or it again points to the lack of sense of urgency the Lakers' FO had before Magic even arrived.

&gt; He once called point guard Lonzo Ball ""transcendent"" and mentioned him alongside Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. He compared the young Lakers' potential to Taylor Swift. After signing Caldwell-Pope, Pelinka again referenced the Bible. In a news conference after signing James, Pelinka put on glasses and started reading from Paulo Coelho's ""The Alchemist,"" noting that James had read it and that Bryant had also given him a copy.

r/NBA has done a good job of collecting these videos. The one with KCP is legitimately hilarious. Pelinka is a Gary Vee level bullshitter. It amazes me when agents and salespeople gain these massive followings despite being so transparently empty.

The Kobe/Ledger story is also almost too good to be true. Luckily, we have video receipts there as well.

&gt; ""We think, more often than not, he's not being truthful,"" a coaching staff member said. ""That goes throughout the organization.""
&gt; 
&gt; Johnson, in his comments on First Take on May 20, referenced Pelinka's reputation, saying, ""When I took the job, you know how many agents called me and said you got to watch out for [Pelinka]?""

Again, just an amazing amount of trash from Pelinka and an immature reaction from Magic. It's too perfect.

This post is getting too long, so I'll wrap it up. The Lakers' incompetence cannot be summed up by any one anecdote or blamed on any one person. The fault lies at nearly every level of the organization. If you've ever watched HBO's veep, you realize that all the characters are mostly trash humans with tidal waves of faults. That's what it felt like reading this article.

Magic came in as the charismatic and loud business executive who thought he could Linkedin post his way to success. When things didn't go his way, he dragged people through the media gauntlet and deflected blame.

Pelinka was the scumbag agent turned GM who showed an aversion to the truth and managed to somehow coming off worse and worse and worse every time he opened his mouth to spew more BS.

LeBron is the superstar who came in, and basically hijacked the organization. His puppets went behind the chain of command's back to manipulate people and force changes he saw fit. In traditional LeGM fashion, the team acquired a bunch of veterans that didn't fit together. Unlike past teams, at least the Lakers knew to keep them on one-year deals.

Then there's Buss and the FO. Reading some of these lines felt like scenes from the office. The amount of apathy and complacency within one of the most storied organizations in sports was jarring. They've been a losing, media mess for years and were shocked Magic wanted to shake things up? Needing therapy because you got chewed out for a decent sized mistake?

He was an All-Star talent, athletic, a versatile defender, but was held back by his tendency to shoot too many long 2s and 3s. However, given his skillset I think he could really thrive in the modern NBA in the Draymond Green role.


I was watching [this highlight video] from his short time with Houston. A lot of it is him running point and throwing some great passes across the floor. In a few of those you can see Houston use a similar setup to the Steph/Dray/Dunker with Harden/Smith/Howard. The Mavs trapped, Harden slipped a pass to Smith, and he consistently hit Dwight for easy lobs.



To be fair this is against a Mavs team rolling out Dirk and Amare as bigs so Dwight was getting some comically easy looks at the rim. But Smoove's skillset is a perfect fit with the Green-type role. Letting him be the screener/catcher lets him use his passing ability (very good for a forward) or use his athleticism to finish at the rim (and in his prime he was a better leaper and dunker than Draymond is). It also would give him a role in the offense that prevents him from chilling on the perimeter, eliminating his biggest weakness.



On defense, he was never as good as Draymond. But he was known for racking up blocks and steals and you could easily see him as a multi-positional defender who could guard either forward spot, sometimes switch, and play good help defense. I doubt he'd be able to fully play the 5 like Draymond or fill as many gaps, but he was definitely a plus defender and a modern scheme could use his athletic gifts in all sorts of ways.



Smith was a pretty interesting player in Atlanta with some clearly defined strengths and weaknesses. I don't see him brought up a ton in all the ""what past players could succeed now?"" threads, partly because he's not that old and because you wouldn't want to encourage his bad shooting tendencies in today's 3pt happy era. But he'd be a perfect 3rd banana on a team like Houston or Portland as a secondary playmaker off Harden/Dame getting trapped, as well as a versatile defensive weapon.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,38642,public,self,Josh Smith in the Draymond Green role,0,1559646900,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/bubft9/josh_smith_in_the_draymond_green_role/,,,,,,,,,,

Obviously the number 1 factor is personnel, it's impossible to copy a team that has 2 of the greatest shooters of all time + a high IQ PF who can pass and initiate the offence as well as he does (and that's before we even mention the 2-time reigning FMVP in Durant). But for the sake of this debate, i want to focus more on the Warriors core 3, like Lowe did in his piece.

&amp;#x200B;

It would seem that the simple effort that Curry and Thompson exert getting around screens and relocating to get another look, involving their bigs in a lot of dribble handoff action - that seems like something that other teams should be exploring more imo.

&amp;#x200B;

We've seen so many of the other best guards in today's game: Harden, Westbrook, Lillard, John Wall (to a lesser extent) run offences, but then be passive to the point of inactive once the ball is out of their hands on offence. 

&amp;#x200B;

Denver seem the most equipped, and probably the only team i can think of that is trying to emulate their style, using Jokic in the Draymond role, and having Jamal Murray and Gary Harris moving off the ball. It obviously needs some work, and they arent nearly as good a shooters as Curry/Klay - but that's the only team i can think of that is attempting to copy it.

22 points per game

44.8% FG

58.3% FT

51.8% TS

Absolutely horrible compared to his regular season.

Next is Kawhi. I think his poor playmaking will be exposed in the Finals. Kawhi has tunnel vision many times. His passes are frequently late or off target. He does not have good feel for the game. Usually he makes the decision to pass or shoot before the defense makes its move. Kawhi's lack of playmaking will be exposed in the Finals.

This is what happens deep in the playoffs. The best teams expose your weaknesses. 

The Warriors will attack Kawhi constantly with double and triple teams. They will dare him to make the right pass at the right time. Over a series Kawhi will fail to make the correct decision enough. He will force too many shots. He will force too many passes. 

Kawhi has never been even an average playmaker. He is way too turnover prone. Even in this years playoffs he is struggling:

3.8 assists per game

3.1 turnovers per game

That tells me he can't consistently beat the double team. This tells me his playmaking is weak and is basically a net zero in playmaking ( almost 1 to 1 assist to turnover ratio). He will also be facing much longer, bigger, and more athletic defender. 

Kawhi will get his. Probably average 27-29 points per game.

[Without further ado, here are the results.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DzylFngUbxr85i8tg5rfS8w5E4gyR_MPC-fl0tD0qKY/edit?usp=sharing) As you can see, Win Shares concurs with the voters in 26/35 cases. On just three occasions (Dwyane Wade in 2011, Chauncey Billups in 2005 and Derek Harper in 1994) did the player with the most Win Shares come from the losing side. The other discrepancies were:

I'm someone who is more on the fence. 

Kawhi had to do a lot this whole playoffs to keep the team competitive, Lowry has been great, Gasol's D has been good but his offense is slightly more sporadic, Danny Green has been pretty bad, and Siakam has largely been a positive. The bench for the raptors has largely under performed aside from these last couple games from Norman Powell and FVV. 

I personally feel like if the Raptors get swept by the warriors or lose in 5 or 6 relatively noncompetitive games, that Kawhi wouldn't actually want to stay with the Raptors. They'll largely be running it back with the same squad as they don't have much space or trade assets to get new blood (and honestly if the warriors didn't exist, they'd be a pretty good team probably). 

I posted a similar thread in r/nba and got responses largely saying the finals won't matter in his decision, but I just don't see that and was hoping for more feedback. 

If the raptors get swept in the finals, I feel like it would be hard for Kawhi to stay there as a sweep the next year might be just as likely. Of course, if they keep it competitive even in a sweep, I could see him staying.

And to hopefully be incredibly fair, much like the sixers, many of the raptors starters and bench didn't have a ton of time to gel, largely Gasol and Powell (and maybe other trades I forgot about). Potentially Kawhi could see pairing up with the former DPOY in Gasol for another year as a major positive as they're both defense-oriented players. 

Kawhi, I believe, would also lose out on a good sum of money accepting a contract from a different team. That + that random offer from some rich person to give him a million-dollar penthouse may be enough to persuade him.

**TLDR/Conclusion**
**But I guess, the question I'm getting at here is - if the raptors heavily under perform in the Finals against a historically great team in the Warriors, (*I'm not saying they will, just what if*) would Kawhi really want to run it back again next year just because he was able to get through the east this year? I feel like just because he got through the ECF people are going a bit crazy with him staying.** 

**Also extra disclaimer: Of course nobody knows what is going through Kawhi's mind. He's notorious for not exactly letting people know his plans.

On the other hand, the Nets went a fantastic 22-11 against the EB10 and 10-10 against the WB10; the Pistons similarly went 21-12 and 8-12. **WOW.** The only team in the West with a worse record against the other conference's bottom 10 than the Pistons is the Suns - and the Pistons are a playoff team in the East. Only 3 teams in the West went less than .500 against the EB10.

The Raptors and the Bucks played the EB10 **37** and **38** times during the regular season, which is a gigantic advantage over West teams, who only get to blow out these losers 20 times. **In fact, in 2019, Kawhi's load was managed exclusively against the EB10.**


I think we can safely conclude that the 5-8 seeds in the West are all easily 55-60 win teams in the East.

If someone wants to do the work, I'd bet it would be illuminating to see just how badly the Bucks were able to blow these teams out, and how much garbage time they accrued to rest their stars. Same for the Raptors, at full strength of course. 

Similarly would be interesting to know how much Embiid padded his stats against the likes of Jarrett Allen and whoever it is that plays the 5 for the Hornets - from a quick glance, 8 of his highest scoring 20 games were against the EB10 and twice against the Hornets. Towns had 6 of his highest scoring 20 against this group, and played them almost half as many times.

The East is shit. 

More specifically, I'm talking about [these teams](https://imgur.com/a/lRpPLZ1), henceforth known as the East Bottom 10 (EB10).

  
Beyond the obvious, and the not so obvious - there being exactly 1 all-NBA player among these teams and there being exactly 1 decent center among these teams - to illustrate just how bad these teams are, here's a table of how well middling West teams played against the EB10, and their bottom 10 counterparts in the West.

I didn't bother with the Spurs because ""road spurs"" and the Lakers because they ended up tanking, and because I am doing this manually.

The Raptors and the Bucks played the EB10 teams 37 and 38 times during the regular season, which is a gigantic advantage over West teams, who only get to blow out these losers 20 times. In fact, in 2019, Kawhi's load was managed exclusively against the EB10.

I'll posit that the 5-8 seeds in the West are all easily 55-60 win teams in the East. Easily.

The sorry state of the East is particularly unfortunate for James Harden, who lost out on a MVP primarily because the Bucks had the best record in the league - if the Nuggets didn't throw against the Blazers and if the Bucks even came 2nd in the East he'd probably be an unanimous MVP.

We watched the Nuggets lose a series where they were the better team, despite having an MVP level facilitator in Jokic. In my opinion, the series showcased their overreliance on him. After the 4OT game, I believe they made efforts to play more through Murray, but I don’t think it was enough/fully developed enough.

They lost to a Blazers team with two guards that take turns being the offensive fulcrum, something which makes them a very dynamic offense in the sense of having more than one way to win. 

The Blazers lost to a Warriors team who had two incredibly powerful offensive fulcrums- Draymond, empowered by the depleted bigs of Myers Leonard and Enes Kanter, and Curry; who both play off each other rather than taking turns.

We watched the Bucks get solved by a Raptors team, and we watched a Raptors team adapt to being solved in part by using Lowry and Gasol as passers outside of Kawhi. 

We watched the Bucks fail to capitalize on Giannis’ gravity in the paint, over and over, largely because Giannis had the ball and simply isn’t an amazing facilitator, and because nobody else on the team seemed able to utilize his impact off a roll or in the paint. 

So, here’s my takeaway

Teams generally have:

* one playmaker (C)
* two or more offensive fulcrums who cannot fully benefit from one another. (b)
* two or more offensive fulcrums who effectively play off each other (A)

I think this is the biggest component of whether you “have another gear” 

If you have one playmaker, you have another gear if and only if that playmaker steps up.

If you have two who play independently, you have another gear if and only if one of the two steps up.

If you have two who play together, you have another gear if those players step up, and yet another gear if those players step up the synergy between them.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,38369,public,self,Is this Playoff a lesson in the importance of secondary playmaking?,0,1559629112,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/btbd6w/is_this_playoff_a_lesson_in_the_importance_of/,,,,,,,,,,
