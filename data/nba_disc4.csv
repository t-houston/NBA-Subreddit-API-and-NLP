So, the question I pose is if a field goal inside the arc were worth 3 points and a shot beyond the arc was worth 4 points, would this introduce more scoring variety?

Luka would be lucky to accumulate the accolades Dirk did throughout his career, and it will be difficult for anybody to match his longevity and sustained success.

In saying that, Luka is posting better averages at 30-10-10 on 63% TS than Dirk ever did. Of course, these box score stats are not conclusive evidence that Luka is performing at a higher level than Dirk ever did, but they at least open up the question.

Luka controls the offense in a way Dirk was never able to. Nearly every possession when he is on the court goes through him as the ball handler, and he is already so advanced that he has propelled the Mavs offense to greatest of all time levels (when comparing NBA offenses to the rest of the league during the season) per Ben Taylor AKA Thinking Basketball's latest video, despite the only slightly above average offensive talent around him. I would argue Dirk at his peak was a better isolation scorer and certainly a better shooter, but I think Luka has a more well rounded offensive game than Dirk did and is elite offensively at more things than Dirk was. This comes with the caveat of course that these players would have played differently in different eras, so it is difficult to say what kind of numbers and impact Dirk would have had now, or Luka would have had back in Dirk's prime. For this reason, it's better to compare players to their competition, and not try to speculate how they would have played in different eras.

Defensively Dirk is slightly better than Luka. Luka is a versatile defender who is quick enough to stick with some guards, and big and strong enough to defend most wings at an adequate level. He's a smart defender who positions himself well, understands angles, and is able to correctly anticipate plays. However, he isn't great at getting around picks and struggles to stay connected to guys off-ball. He is often late rotating on help, and he can look lackadaisical off-ball at times. Dirk was by no means a defensive stalwart, but he was a smart defender with precise, active hands who positioned himself well. His size gave him decent rim protection despite being athletically challenged and lacking elite length. He wasn't as versatile as Luka is, but this wasn't a huge deal in his day. I think Dirk was a better defender than Luka is, even if due to nothing more than big man defense being more valuable than wing defense.

Luka has only been doing this for 17 games now, so perhaps it is premature to ask questions like this before he has proved he can play at this level for a full season. However, there aren't any telltale signs that what he is doing isn't sustainable. He isn't shooting the lights out and neither is Dallas as a team, he isn't getting lucky on foul calls, he hasn't been going against weak competition. It's possible he will run out of gas and his level of play will decline as a result, but I'm not going to bet on that happening.

**TL;DR**: Luka is better right now than Dirk ever was. He's a more well rounded offensive player who can do more and is elite at more things. Dirk was a slightly better defensive player however this isn't enough to give him the edge over Luka in my eyes.",False,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,71696,public,self,Is Luka Doncic better right now than Dirk Nowitzki ever was?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/e2anej/is_luka_doncic_better_right_now_than_dirk/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Could anyone help me understand why this is? Never watched this era, this was the time when Raptors were my favorite team because they had a dinosaur as their logo. Was it mainly bad offense or good defense across the league, rules, or a combination of all three?  
  
From what I can gather from stats, we had some all-time defensive monsters like Duncan, Mutombo, Garnett and Wallace. We didn't have any all-time offensive systems during that era - Dirk and Nash's Dallas in 02-04 was by far the best offense of that era.

Forget that Kawhi’s family is in SoCal, forget that LA is better for business interests, I think a decent case can be made that Kawhi would have a better shot at the title had he stayed in Toronto. 

Obviously hindsight is 20/20, and there’s no guarantee Siakam and FVV would be playing like al stars had Kawhi stayed. But just for shits let’s assume Kawhi and Danny Green are still raptors, and that Siakam and FVV still step up. Kawhi less Raptors is pretty comparable to a Kawhi less Clippers tbh. 

1. Toronto has more depth, comparable top end talent 

Siakam is playing like a fringe MVP averaging 26-8-4 and great defense, kinda poor man’s Giannis. FVV is putting up 19-4-8, which might actually get all star recognition since Simmons is playing like trash this season. Lowry was great before he got injured, and the team would still have Ibaka, Green, Powell, Anunoby, Gasol, etc. Anunoby aside, all the rest of those guys we saw last playoffs are capable of scoring 20+ on any given night. 

PG is probably still better than Siakam but I think it’s close. Lou williams is averaging 23 points as a 3rd option, Harrell and Beverley are great but beyond that I don’t think the Clippers bench stacks up. 

2. The East somehow got even weaker 

So far IMO only Boston and Milwaukee look like they have a real shot at contending. Philly was my pre season pick to come out of the east, but Simmons and Embiid both look like they’ve regressed, they lost Butler and replaced him with a discount version, and Redick for nothing. Yes they got Al Horford but I don’t think it offsets those losses. Al Horford also doesn’t provide Butler’s scoring. Even if you consider Miami and Indiana to be contenders, they’re a far cry from the west’s top 6. 

The west has 6 teams (LAL, LAC, HOU, UTAH, DEN, DAL) I think that are either contenders or can cause serious trouble in the early rounds. Not to mention you have to play them all throughout the regular season. POR and SAS were both playoff teams last year, both have 2 all star caliber players each, yet are at the bottom of the conference. 

Toronto with Kawhi not only would have an easier time getting through the regular season, but also the early rounds of the playoffs. They could load manage Kawhi without thinking twice. They were 17-5 in the 22 games he sat last year, but the Clippers I think have a losing record with him sitting so far. If the Clippers botch the load management thing and get too low of a seed, imagine having to play say Utah, Houston, LAL. Before facing whoever comes out of the east, that got to feast on teams like Orlando and Brooklyn. 

Toronto even without Kawhi has been fantastic. They beat LAL, and played a competitive game all the way to the end against LAC in a back to back. And even with Lowry, Ibaka, and OG injuries, they’re still 12-4 (compared to Clippers 12-5)",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,71675,public,self,Would Kawhi have been better off staying in Toronto?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/e26tef/would_kawhi_have_been_better_off_staying_in/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If I understand things properly, the proposed changes are:

* An in-season tournament that decides...uh...who wins the in-season tournament 
* A playoff play-in tournament for the bottom seeds
* Reseeding playoff teams after the second round

There's a [good WaPo article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/11/23/nbas-proposed-schedule-playoff-format-changes-explained/) that lays it out really well. But, I'm not sure I buy all of the arguments.

It all feels like they are, at worst, solutions in search of a problem or, at best, designed to treat symptoms and not root causes.

The in-season tournament is the former. I have no idea what problem this solves and I can't imagine why any player or team would care, one way or another. I would much rather see a Big 3 style, 3-on-3 tournament during All-Star weekend. Or, even better, an NBA Jams/White Men Can't Jump 2-on-2 tournament.

The play-in and, to a lesser extent, reseeding, both skirt the real issues on how NBA teams acquire and retain talent. I don't pretend to know how to address either of those issues directly but I know that pretending that something else like seeding is the issue isn't going to help. 

What incentive does a 10th seed have to play-in to the playoffs? The owners may make a little more money on a couple home games during the first round but what else? Any lottery pick, even a mediocre one, is likely to be more valuable in the long run than an almost certain beat down that will come from facing the one seed. The flattening of lottery pick odds was a half-measure and did little to truly incentivize bubble teams to try and push into the playoffs or truly disincentive anti-competitive personnel moves (aka tanking). Sure, I suppose you could argue that going to the playoffs is the incentive in and of itself. I just don't buy that. But, I'm willing to hear this argument out. But, if you want more evenly distributed talent and fewer incentives to tank,first stop is fixing the lottery.

Further, if the NBA was really interested in giving lower seeds an incentive to get into the playoffs, one change they could make, or undo really, is go back to a best of 5 first round. That format facilitates a shorter but more exciting first round and opens the door for more upsets.  (PS: I HATE the 7 game first round. It's just too damned long and largely uninteresting, IMO)

The reseeding, again, appears to the point. If the argument is that the conferences are unbalanced, pretending that conferences don't exist isn't the answer. If the point is that we want to see the best teams play each other later in the playoffs, then, I guess this could work but that seems, again, a solution that nobody asked for. I get that reseeding might yield *different* matchups at *different*  times but I'm hard pressed to say that the new outcomes are objectively *better* than what we have. In fact, I could make the argument that we are better served by having the better teams in a stacked conference battle it out early, while they're still fresh rather than drag it out and risk injuries. 

Even if they took it one step further and just took the best 16, conferences be damned, it would still be suboptimal. And, if the recent popularization of load management is any indication, geography and the long flights that a more ""balanced"" schedule might create, isn't likely to yield more competitive play.

He wasn't doing anything besides putting up empty stats on the Cavs before LeDad came and saved his career. He came into a great situation with the Celtics, who were pretty much the same team but upgraded from IT to him. That team was young, but did great in the playoffs without him, so everyone expected them to do ever better the following year. We all know what happened last year. 
Now fast forward to the present and the Nets are 5-1 without him, being led by Dinwiddie AND the team is missing LeVert. They were only playing .500 ball with Kyrie. 
So Kyrie has played on all these great rosters, but could never maximize the talent around him because he is a horrible leader, doesn't make anyone else around him better, extremely moody, puts himself before the team, and is probably a douche. (Ok that last one is my opinion, but everything else stands.)

To me, he's a good basketball player, an all star level at most.

Last year they won at a 61 win pace with a +8 srs and nearly made the final. Right now?

 [https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA\_2020.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020.html) 

They are ***+10***. In case you're wondering, that's a ***67 win pace.*** The closest to the bucks are the +7.8 Lakers. All this talk about the Bucks getting weaker, but at the moment they're playing much better basketball than they did last season. even with, arguably, their second-best attacker injured. They've also played the vast majority of their games so far, on the road.  Simply put, they are, currently, playing the best basketball in the league.

Much of this is because Giannis himself, is playing much better basketball, Last season he easily led the league in the most predictive advanced stats: pipm, backpicks bpm, and luck adjusted rapm with a score around +6. Right now, his team is ***8***  points better with him on the floor. For reference, the highest rs pipm ever was 2009 Lebron, who himself  had a score of +9 while taking the 09 cavs to 66 wins. Most of this improvement seems to be coming from the offensive end, and more specifcally, ***his interioir passing.*** His assist percentage has spiked by 4 points with a marginal increase in turnover ratio. A higher percentage of his assists are now ***layups***. And his passes have been higher velocity. He still misses reads, but the improvement is prmising, and more importantly, may make what the Raptors attempted last season harder to execute. Giannis has also added a stepback midrange, is shooting more and more efficiently from 3 thanks to improved shooting form, and as a result has become more versatile as a scorer. Contrary to popular belief though, it's his improved ***passing*** that will have the greatest effect on other team's ability to defend him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last year's playoffs, the celtics, the pistons and the raptors all tried to sag off him. Their defenses all got destroyed doing so:

[https://youtu.be/MU4oFyHn4bQ?t=50](https://youtu.be/MU4oFyHn4bQ?t=50)

Give Giannis space to drive and you die. That's why the -10 Raps D got blown to hell by milwaukee despite the bucks shooting significantly worse from three and open shots. The bucks simply created way more oppurtunities. To Stop Giannis, the Raptors had to blitz him, ***coming out*** to cut off his drives.

What can we conclude from this

* Taking the 6th, and 5th spot are the Rockets. The Houston Rockets shoot a shit ton of three, but are not as efficient as the other 4 teams on this list. Not one of their players on both years shot over 40% from 3.
* The 4th spot goes to the Warriors. The Warriors were carried super hard by Curry and Klay. It just shows how great they are as shooters. Barnes also shot 40% as well, but the efficiency of Curry and Klay is crazy, especially when considering that only 3 out of their 15 players shot over 35%
* 3rd place goes to the Magic. While the Warriors are higher in volume and efficiency. The **team** as a whole was poor shooting outside the 3 mentioned. The Magic edge them out because they have more 3 point threats.
* 2nd place goes to the Knicks. Their argument against the Warriors is the same as Orlando. They have more volume than the Warriors but less efficiency. But the team as a whole has better shooting. If either Klay or Steph sits that half their shooting power right there. As for the the Magic, they had 50 more makes on the same efficiency. Just a bit better.
* 1st place in my opinion is the Phoenix Suns. It just shows how ahead of their time they were. They were the most efficient team, just had the lowest volume. But when you account for the time period that they played this is fucking amazing. They have 3 out of the 5 most efficient players in this post. That Phoenix team was special

The below are my candidates for MVP IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER**

####**MVP**####

**1) Lebron James**

&gt; I genuinely believe LBJ has gotten better; there has been a drop in his athleticism for sure and that is to be expected but he has been absolutely phenomenal this season and he is doing it effortlessly. 

&gt; His defense has improved and he is having his best season in that regard since his sophomore season and career high in assists. 

&gt; Is it sustainable? Granting no injuries to the team I can see him continuing to keep this up. 

**2) Giannis** 

&gt; The bucks didn't have the easiest of the starts to the season in terms of schedule difficulty but they are still doing really well. Obviously having reigning MVP helps in that regard. 

&gt; He has been an absolute beast on both ends of the floor and is shooting a career high in 3PA. He is sitting at 30% from beyond the arc and If Giannis can keep taking and hitting them all season he is going to make things nightmarish for other teams. 

**3) James Harden** 

&gt; I really hope he wins the MVP this year. Harden has *consistently* improved his scoring over the years and is going on a historic tear right now. 

&gt; He is averaging 38 POINTS a game along with 8 assists and 6 rebounds. Teams have literally been doubling him and daring anyone but him to beat them. 

**4) Luka Doncic**

&gt; This kid is special. 

&gt; This is his second year and he has upped his game to another level and turned his team around from last season. He is putting up 30 points a game and nearly a triple double. He is obviously still young and I doubt he wins it this year but watch-out.

**5) KAT and Kawhi Leonard and Siakam** 

&gt; KAT has been slipping under the radar for a while now but he has been killing it this season. 

&gt; Siakam is the main guy for the Raptors and he is delivering. 

&gt; I don't think Leonard is aiming for the MVP in all honesty and is perfectly content taking games off all season to ready himself for the playoffs.

A few years ago, I wanted to write about a businessman's move from Oklahoma City to San Francisco. The company he was leaving had just finished the year behind of his new company and although this businessman had spent his whole career at one company, he felt he was better suited to leave his friends and have a fresh start. If you're a basketball fan, you know I'm talking about Kevin Durant, a player who left the Thunder to join the Warriors and as a result, was able to start his own production house with a show on ESPN+, win two championships and build his brand through the endorsements living in such a demanding market offers. My point was to show sports is a business and players have to do what's best for them, regardless of loyalty.  
I still believe that, but after my own perspectives changing, I realized I had the wrong point of view. In high school sports, players represent their neighborhood or their town. In college sports, players represent their state, but to lesser of an extent due to recruiting. And in pro sports, players represent...what? Their city? Sometimes, in the cases of Lebron James, Lonzo Ball and Derrick Rose (none of whom play for their hometown anymore). But usually they represent the organization. They represent a general manager from Massachusetts and a coach from Indiana drafting a player from California to a pro club based in Texas. That's not bad. It just is.  
But after my last article, I tried an experiment on NBA 2K19. I added all six of the teams to MyLeague and started the expansion draft with one simple rule: only free agents were allowed in the draft pool. I'll explain. Most of the time, when a league expands, every other team can choose to protect certain players and the rest will be put in a pool for the expansion team to pick from. We saw this most recently with the NHL's Vegas Golden Knights. They made a motley crew of misfits who embraced their identity and became a powerhouse. But by leaving only free agents unprotected, a few interesting things happened: firstly, some of the game's biggest superstars were now left open to play as part of an expansion team, giving these new clubs an immediate face to the franchise and an established star. Secondly, it gave these stars a free choice. No longer can they be vilified as a snake or sell-out, they never had the choice to begin with. With this in mind, I ran the draft and some of the NBA's biggest stars found themselves in new homes: Lebron James in Las Vegas, Paul George in Louisville, Deandre Jordan in Vancouver, Kevin Durant in Seattle, Nikola Jokic and Brandon Ingram in Montreal, Dwight Howard and Carmelo Anthony in Virginia Beach. But of all those players, only one signed their new contract with a new team. Lebron left Las Vegas to play for the Lakers, which ironically leads to my next point.  
I got in an argument a while ago with this guy who thought the Lakers were bad for the NBA since they have all the best talent. After doing some research, I found that most of the Lakers' biggest moves to get the stars they had were trades or draft picks. Wilt Chamberlain? Trade. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar? Trade. Magic Johnson? Draft. Kobe Bryant? A two-for-one here with a draft day trade. Pau Gasol and Lamar Odom? Trades. Anthony Davis? Trades. When you look back at the major moves that have made the Lakers champions, the only two that brought stars to Los Angeles via free agency were Shaquille O'Neal and Lebron James. And if we're being technical, Lebron hasn't won a title yet, although this might be his year.  
Thinking about the Lakers' trade success and the (simulated) retention of NBA 2K19's expansion teams didn't make me realize that smaller markets have a fighting chance thru the max contract or by draft acumen, I've been using the success of the Utah Jazz, San Antonio Spurs, Portland Trail Blazers, Indiana Pacers and Orlando Magic as arguments against the idea that big-market teams have an unfair advantage for a long time. But it did make me realize that small market teams can weaponize that advantage for themselves by trading away their superstars for pieces, essentially creating a sum vs. whole argument.  
When Wilt was traded to the Lakers, he was the MVP traded for Darrall Imhoff, Jerry Chambers and Archie Clark. When Kareem was traded to the Lakers, it was for Elmore Smith, Brian Winters, and rookies Dave Meyers and Junior Bridgeman. Kobe's draft rights were traded for Vlade Divac. Pau Gasol was traded for Javaris Crittendon, Aaron McKie, Marc Gasol's draft rights, and draft picks that later turned into OJ Mayo and Xavier Henry (quick aside: the Grizzlies could've had a team of Mike Conley, Marc Gasol, Kevin Love and Lance Stephenson or Landry Fields in 2010, but hindsight is 20/20). Lamar Odom was traded for Shaquille O'Neal, Caron Butler and Brian Grant. I listed all those deals to say it took almost fifty years for a team trading their star to win a championship. The Lakers sold penny stocks at dollar prices for a half-century and only the Heat won a title, although Memphis got close.  
I think that might be changing, however. Big-market teams have gotten greedier for stars and are willing to pay more in players and in prospects to do it. We saw a proto-version of in Houston, when Sixth Man Of The Year James Harden was traded to Houston for prospects. I call this a ""proto"" because Oklahoma City wanted to keep Harden, but couldn't come to terms on a deal and Harden hadn't developed into the star he is yet. But this offseason, we saw two trades that could change the NBA. Oklahoma City traded star forward Paul George for point guard prospect Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and FIVE first-round draft picks, as well as sneaky star Danilo Gallinari. New Orleans traded star forward Anthony Davis for Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart and three first-round picks. With New Orleans having G League Executive of the Year Trajan Langdon and Oklahoma City having wizard Sam Presti at their respective helms, I think we're on the cusp of a new era of basketball business. In return for one player, New Orleans now has one of the most exciting line-ups in the NBA, especially when chosen one Zion Williamson returns. And Oklahoma City has so many options, it's difficult to count. We could be looking at the next Warriors-style youth movement in OKC.  
I think this is the wave of the future. There's rumors reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo may be leaving Milwaukee in 2021. Why not trade him to New York for say, Dennis Smith Jr., Mitchell Robinson, Kevin Knox and four first-rounders if you can? This may not be as far-fetched as it sounds, especially with the history of the NBA. Small-market teams have thrived on their scouting and coaching, and trading these stars for instant, immediate rebuilds seems like a strategy that may work. If New Orleans can make it into the playoffs once they get healthy, we could be looking at a scary team rather than a scary player, with the average age of the team being just over 25 years old by the time the playoffs start in April. We've already seen a line-up similar to this once with the Oklahoma City Thunder back in 2010 with the ascendant Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant and James Harden on similar rookie deals. The Thunder had James Harden for only three years before a trade, but with the Lebron James experiment failing the way it did, maybe New Orleans can pitch their future stars on hometown loyalty and a sense of stability to save a bit of money on their contracts. The contracts should expire either the year before or the year of the expiry of the NBA collective bargaining agreement, which may see a rise in the salary cap.  
The argument to balance big market cities makes less sense every year, especially with the NBA's parity having a chance to showcase itself the way it does. Over half the league makes the playoffs after an 82-game season, with the playoffs themselves being a seven-game series over four rounds. The best teams usually make the Finals and since NBA expansion, those teams are coming from increasingly smaller markets. Since the NBA-ABA merger in 1976, only fifteen franchises have won a championship. Those teams are the Portland Trail Blazers once, the Washington Bullets (now Wizards) once, the Seattle SuperSonics once, the Los Angeles Lakers eleven times, the Boston Celtics four times, the Philadelphia 76ers once, the Detroit Pistons three times, the Chicago Bulls six times, the Houston Rockets twice, the San Antonio Spurs four times, the Dallas Mavericks once, the Miami Heat twice, the Golden State Warriors four times, the Cleveland Cavaliers once and the Toronto Raptors once.  
Of those fifteen teams, their market sizes as of Nielsen's 2018-19 rankings are #22 (Portland), #6 (Washington DC), #13 (Seattle), #2 (Los Angeles), #9 (Boston), #4 (Philadelphia), #14 (Detroit), #3 (Chicago), #7 (Houston), #31 (San Antonio), #5 (Dallas), #16 (Miami), #8 (Bay Area), #19 (Cleveland) and #1 (Toronto). Going back ten years to the 2009-2010 season, only Los Angeles has been in the top ten of American market size. Quick asterisk: Toronto is throwing this off a bit, because of their status as the biggest market in Canada as well as the only market outside of the United States. But whether or not you take them into account, the average market size ranking of the NBA champions hovers from 10 to 11. The tenth and eleventh largest markets in the United States are Atlanta and Tampa, but we need to expand those parameters since Tampa doesn't have an NBA team. If we include the ninth and twelfth largest markets in America, we have Boston, Atlanta and Phoenix. Boston and Phoenix are sitting with winning records as of this writing and what Atlanta is (severely) lacking in wins, they're making up for in Trae Young.

There's a reason why all time great players such as Kobe, Shaq, Steph Curry, Kareem, Wilt, Magic etc. all played either part of their career or all of their career in California.

To think the kind of base athleticism and then ridiculous will power and commitment it takes to get back to NBA shape, I'm super surprised hes playing like he is, hes been like a super 6 man and probable MIP candidate. I think in my biased opinion hes the most exciting in game dunker in league right now. This season on the Hawks he has been sensational (in comparison to rest of career especially). We are super depleted right now, so I'm not taking teams record into account when i say this. But my case for this post is as follows:

Big bodies the defense and yams it on a 7ft bamboo stick, impressive. His 2nd dunk for me is crazy as well, really exemplifies in my opinion what makes the coolest dunkers cool: the ability to look like so effortless 

**https://streamable.com/0w41f**
I think the commentator does an excellent job expressing my thoughts for me. Oh, my! When I looked at this highlight I literally did not think it was a dunk highlight, I thought it had been mistitled. He doesnt have a straight line for this, he has 3(?) Direction changes and heavy contact on his shoulder then floats from the floor.

Any better call for this dunk? Gosh the announcer acted like it didnt happen, the crowd literally ""oh'd"" before they cheered. Anfernee Simon's got banished to the shadow realm on this full court dunk by Jabari. 

In conclusion I could reasonably see Derrick Jones jr, giannis, or a few others being put forward, but I think Jabari is that man rn. On atlanta hes getting a serious opportunity to show out at this moment in time, and is dunking off the dribble and at full speed, half speed, suddenly, with power, etc. His range of dunking plus the ease of which he does it is part of my argument.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **The Premise**

I assume most of you have heard the recent news of a mid season tournament. The tournament would go like this.

\- A group stage where teams play teams within their division for a top spot. For this I assume you would either play each other team twice, once on home court, once on away court, resulting in 8 games. A more unlikely scenario would be playing each team once, and the top seeded team at that time in the season gets home court advantage, resulting in 4 games. If the tournament lasts till Christmas, I would assume the former, 8 games. Then as Woj said, the divisional winners, and the next 2 best play in a single elimination tournament. Quarter finals, Semi Finals, Finals.

Here is my idea on how to make this tournament meaningful.

In the group/division stage one win counts for one regular season win (or loss). Then in the tournament stage a win counts for more than one regular season win. I would say 3 wins, so winning the entire tournament stage would count for 9 wins (and the wins in the divisional stage). This could be rearranged, for example, QuarterFinal Win: 3 wins, SemiFinal: 4 wins, Finals: 8 wins. You could adjust it to 2/3/4 etc.

- I should add that a loss in the divisional round counts as a loss for the regular season, but losing in the tournament doesn’t. 

2. **Why this would work**

The main arguments against the tournament is that it is meaningless. Well this system would directly impact the regular season and playoff seeding. If you are going to sit your nba players, why would you sit them for games that are worth more regular season wins? The worst you could do in the tournament is 8 losses, the best would be 17 wins (or more if you further increased the tourney win impact). It would be foolish to sit it out.

3. **What about mediocre/tanking teams? Wouldn't a Cinderella story hurt them?**

Here's where my second idea comes in. At the end of the regular season, teams can decide to opt their tournament success in for draft pick benefits. If they did well in the tournament they could move up in the draft a select amount of spots. The exact specific of this I'm less certain on. Let's say QuarterFinal: 3 spots, SemiFinal: 6 spots, Final:9 spots. That means a teams normally drafting 30-20 could draft 20-10, picking up a solid bench player in the draft. For the middling 20-10 teams they could get a picks in the lottery. This goes past the draft incentive issues of the best team getting the #1 pick, as it takes into account their record. Under dog teams in the 20-10 mark winning the tournament would be massive, it's an unlikely scenario and they get a big reward. Those teams like Charlotte and Magic stuck in mediocrity? They know get to top 5 talent.

4. **Why should they decide at the end of the Season?**

Well It takes into scenarios such as teams getting injured, falling off or heating up. Let's take the Lakers 2018-2019 season, and say in this hypothetical the win the tournament, the LeBron gets injured. Now instead of tanking and not playing LeBron when he recovered from his injury, the can try and get into the playoffs, then add 17+ wins to their record, we'd then see LeBron in the playoffs. If then the Lakers failed to do this, they could choose the draft benefits and pick up a talent young player. Also in our current season imagine if Curry didn't get injured early and instead later in the season Imagine if the Warriors won the tournament and then Curry got injured and their post season hopes got thrown away. If they won the tourney they would've had to deal with the extra 17 wins and get a worse draft pick, but with the end of season decision, they can now use it as a benefit, getting them a better pick.

5. **But how would more wins or a kind of decent draft pick incentivise top teams?**

Why would a Team that has no chance of missing the playoffs benefit? Why would they want extra wins or a 20th draft pick? Well they still have to play those 8 divisional games, and to throw it go 4-4, of 11 games, they would have to play 8. Why would they want 4-4 added to their record just so they don't have to play the 3 round tourney, which would last like a week or a week an a half. They would also be missing out on the draft pick/win addition back-up in case their season ends up going in a bad direction. 

If you made the ‘championship rights’ trade-able that could be interesting. For example a top team might use it in a package to acquire a good player from a mediocre team that is looking to rebuild. 

6. **Flow-on effects and other incentives compared.**

I think one effect of this tournament would be on media narratives and the excitement around those elimination games and potential upsets. If a player chokes or is clutch, it gives material for talkshows. It could be used in MVP arguments, seeing whether a player is 'clutch' or not, and how they stacked up against other MVP frontrunners. How would have MVP voting gone if we saw Kawhi shutdown Giannis? The main incentive people talk about is monetary benefits. Well for that to matter, you'd have to give massive amounts of money. If people got 50% more or 100% of their salary that would have a serious effect on the league and it would not be good. Free Agents would only be interested in going to the best team possible. I wouldn't know where you could get that money, without every player's guaranteed money being reduced, and I doubt the NBPA would agree to that.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,71510,public,self,How can the proposed mid-season tourney be made relevant?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/e137ma/how_can_the_proposed_midseason_tourney_be_made/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Like I do feel the NBA needs to stop caring about money iniatives like the all star game and more games played and think about player safety. I know baseball plays like over 100 games and soccer plays for almost a whole year but difference is those sports aren't as demanding fmo. Soccer is demanding with how much you run but you also play once a week. In the NBA you are playing 2-4 games a week of faste pace and scoring.

   I think the NBA most importantly need to just cut the games. I think this could help players with injuries and help with rest and recovery.

The consensus on r/nba was that they would make one or two trades (maybe involving whiteside) to improve their obvious weakness at the forward position. But with their lack of depth outside of guard spots and recent injuries will they just punt on this year?

Who knows how nurk and Collins will do when they come back and if anyone will give up something substantial for whiteside(if they want to move him). I know that won’t fit with what the players want but do they have much choice? The main players talked about are love or gallinari or maybe one of New York’s many wing players. But gallinari is expiring and very injury prone so I doubt they would be willing to give up much for him. Love is on a long expensive contract, is aging, and has also racked up a few injuries also. Maybe they like one of New York’s forwards but Gibson doesn’t offer much offensively. Would they make a risky trade for one of Morris, Portis, or randle?

Watching Luka for his entire career its always blown my mind that he can create separation in the paint and on his stepback at will. Of course a lot of this is due to his dribble skills and strength but he has some of the most athletic hips I’ve ever seen. Take [a look](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/LikelySecondAttwatersprairiechicken-max-1mb.gif) at this gif where he creates separation for the stepback. His right foot plants and he [internally rotates](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQwS8GtmVUSy1fpjGivwsVaDuZPCr8jyEX3xm4EEMzqsgxRja21) his hip to a large degree and abducts the other to create a huge distance from his defender to shoot from. This is yogi level hip flexibility and a huge part of what gets him open shots. The internal rotation allows his force to push himself away from the defender because the force vector is close to parallel with the ground, rather than a perpindicular force vector that wouldn’t create nearly the same amount of separation and would just create vertical power.

Now think about his scoring in the paint. While Luka is not thought of as “athletic” in the traditional sense compared to guys like Lebron, one of his athletic abilities is truly elite - his stopping. He has an ability to stop on a dime and hold that pivot foot due to his athletic hips which opens up a variety of post moves. If you watch [these clips](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/WarySpectacularBudgie-size_restricted.gif) of him in the post, you’ll see that he uses his hips to create horizontal separation rather than vertical. His hips are always in a slightly internally rotated position for this purpose. Even when he shoots free throws.

What are your thoughts? Where do you disagree with the list? Where do you think they handled it well? How do you feel about the ongoing debate about how to weigh postseason versus regular season production, how to weigh impact versus box score production, and how to weigh championship seasons versus early exit seasons? How did this list improve or worsen by comparison with the 2015 list?

Note #1: I am linking to a specific comment summary detailing the changes from the previous project (which I believe was set from something like 1960-2015). The new additions, starting with Russell Westbrook, are thus “disruptive” to some of the relative rankings. For example, Bob McAdoo saw a base gain of +2; however four brand new players were added from years not considered in the earlier list, so his relative change is more like +6. Reed’s relative change is +7; Gilmore’s relative change is +4; Harden’s relative change is +2; Nash’s, Howard’s, and Pettit’s relative change is +1; Paul’s relative change is +0; Barkley’s and Karl Malone’s relative change is -1; and Frazier’s relative change is -4.

Note #2: I *think* the methodology changed from the prior iteration. Previously, I think posters voted for a player year, but in tallying the votes, total player votes and *then* specific year was calculated. If the votes were evenly split between two seasons, the player’s individual placement would not suffer. As an example, in this project, 1990 and 1993 Barkley are completely separate votes. This benefits players with clear and indisputable peak years (e.g. McAdoo, Westbrook, McGrady, Garnett, Walton, Barry, Giannis) and hurts players with more contentious peak years (I believe this most affected Kobe, West, Nash, and Frazier within the project).",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,71313,public,self,RealGM 2019 Top 40 Peaks,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/e010yo/realgm_2019_top_40_peaks/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://youtu.be/VwynmarNMkI
https://youtu.be/7ougHDwFQJU
Basically, Harden’s defender tries to force Harden to drive right, trying to induce a uncomfortable Harden layup (with Harden being a weaker right handed finisher than left) or a wide open floater(which Harden is also unspectacular with).

Whilst execution was poor for the first 2 games of the series, resulting in easy Houston wins, execution tightened up for Games 3, 4 and 5 resulting in a grind of a series with Houston’s last two wins coming by a combined total of 10 points, with a 7 point differential in favour of the Jazz over the last 3 games.

A common theme, and excuse used by Jazz fans with regards to their series is astronomically low shooting percentages across virtually the entire rotation. Some of these numbers are jaw dropping. Korver 33.3% from 3(y’all know who he is). Ricky Rubio 20% from 3(ok small sample size and a mechanically flawed shot, but a &gt;30% shooter across the last 2 regular seasons and playoffs). Mitchell 25.6% from 3(also a &gt;30% shooter across last two regular seasons and playoffs, shooting &gt;35% in the regular season on 7 attempts a game over his regular season career). Crowder 30% from 3. Ingles 27.6% from 3(great shooter). Virtually the only player to shoot close to their career percentages was Royce O’Neale, who shot 34.8% from 3 on 23 total attempts for the series.

Now, your first thoughts may include: Jazz are a bad shooting team/small sample size/tight rims etc. I don’t dismiss all of these factors, but I will propose a hypothesis(that hopefully hasn’t been discussed at length before): the Jazz’ defensive system was the main cause of their poor shooting performance.

With the way they guarded Harden, Capela(or whoever Gobert is matched up on) sets a ball screen on Harden’s defender and Harden instantly gets a wide open floater/mid range pull-up. However, Harden doesn’t take that shot early in the shot clock, due to D’Antoni’s system favouring slow, grinding play and either 3s or layups(although I think this is BS as Paul shoots plenty of ISO 2s and Harden made some clutch floaters). 

Instead, Harden can easily draw out the possession. Gobert mostly has to stay put to discourage the lob to Capela(which he often didn’t do games 1,2), so he can’t step out on Harden. Harden can easily draw back, dribble back to the 3 point line, and run the exact same action at least 2 times in the shot-clock.

Over time, being hit/fighting through tonnes of screens, and playing such high strong isolation defence against a player like Harden has an effect on fatigue and your shooting. I think this could be a contributing factor to Steph’s worst shooting performances of his career against the Cavs in the 2016 finals(where he was continuously isolated by Bron and Kyrie) and the 2018 WCF(although another reason was KD’s ISO play hindering the Warriors traditional motion offence).

And the Jazz threw plenty of perimeter defenders at Harden. I don’t use the NBA’s flawed matchup data(a rim contest by Gobert doesn’t mean he was the primary defender on Harden for a possession, despite NBA’s matchup data thinking so), and I don’t want to manually count the number of screens taken/possessions guarding Harden for Mitchell/Rubio/Royce/Ingles/Crowder across the series, but basically I do remember all of those guys guarding Harden at times and taking a fair few screens.

Now, this is just a bit of a hunch/shower thought, and to be a properly developed idea I would need to manually run through the whole series and count stuff like screens taken/possessions guarded and then compare them to previous playoff series. 
Furthermore, the Jazz shot better in the 2018 matchup between these teams, although that isn’t directly comparable as the Jazz’ defensive schemes shifted slightly between the series, and personnel was also slightly different(Exum and Burks were valuable in the 2018 series and yet didn’t see any play in 2019 due to injury/trade, whilst Rubio didn’t play the 2018 series. Impact of this: less athletic bodies to throw at Harden, e.g. Exum could fight over Harden screens and body him up very well at times esp. game 3).

But I just wanted to put this thought out there and see if anyone agreed.

TL;DR:
- running through lots of screens and defending Harden on isolation plays is tiring both mentally and physically
- The Jazz’ 2019 altered defensive scheme induced more toll taken by the individual Harden defenders
- This resulted in Jazz losing their legs which affected their shooting percentages; therefore their loss to the rockets wasn’t complete bad luck.
- If the Jazz executed properly from game 2, and had a few more athletic body to use(Exum and Mudiay for example just for 10-15 minutes a night), the series is probably considerably different",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,71313,public,self,Did the Jazz’ defensive schemes against Harden in the playoffs last year directly affect their woeful shooting performances,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/e007uh/did_the_jazz_defensive_schemes_against_harden_in/,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'm58A78r9R5u4scb0D3yIznPjhtdN6K3-1NSND75a14I', 'resolutions': [{'height': 81, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/KN-AtVimCYWWRs6NQnaJ0TgU-zv2-aaKDoVf3Ig5kkc.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bb0b1981d861ef16515155d011fb3fd605ea6f2', 'width': 108}, {'height': 162, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/KN-AtVimCYWWRs6NQnaJ0TgU-zv2-aaKDoVf3Ig5kkc.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb5ed545a962efa651aead9f5cb2d8db8b6cb5b4', 'width': 216}, {'height': 240, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/KN-AtVimCYWWRs6NQnaJ0TgU-zv2-aaKDoVf3Ig5kkc.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75136bce6472b9610672de61a6627e5267a95a74', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/KN-AtVimCYWWRs6NQnaJ0TgU-zv2-aaKDoVf3Ig5kkc.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=bf54a67c35255a7984673ceb2941dec36f941ed2', 'width': 480}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,,

  For me D lo could potentially be a guy like Gilbert Arenas or Michael Redd back in the mid 200s. Both were scoring guards who relied a lot on their shooting ability to get points. For players in the present or recent past, I feel like D lo could be a poor man's Dame Lillard which isn't exactly like Dame but someone who plays like him. Dame is a better finisher but I feel Dame and D lo play the same way minus the playmaking. Lillard loves to shoot from deep a lot and D lo has that style.

 I also agree with the Lou Williams or at a higher extent Manu comparisions. I think D lo could be the best sixth man in the league if he accepted that role espeically with GS. He would have an easier time against players he coud score on and still close games. he could get 20 a game like Lou as been doing the last two years in LA.

  Lastly, this will be hard but if he ever reaches POINT GOD god, I feel he can be close to Steve Nash and even a poor man's Cp3. For me he has to improve his passing which I think is his best attribute but I feel his style of play can be so close to them. I feel people ae lazy with theHarden or scoring guard comparisions when fmo, he could be so much better and resepcted if he looked to play old-school PG a bit more.

  Everyone goes hard on D lo with the way he plays but I think he is capable of being a very good winning player in the right situation and almost everywhere. Honestly his playstyle is very similar to Jayson Tatum and Brandon Ingram that they have elite midrange potential and could score in variety of ways. He needs to work om his finishing for sure and defense but I feel he can improve a bit on thsoe areas. he already has gotten more fts sof ar this year and looks more agressive at the rim.

Michael Jordan was a phenomenal basketball player.   Almost certainly a top 10 player.  I also grew up in the 80's and 90's idolizing him.

However, as I've matured and grew to view basketball a little more sophisticatedly, I've begun to question his GOAT status.  Here's why.

Michael Jordan came into the NBA after 3 years of North Carolina basketball.  He had an outstanding rookie season with the Bills scoring 28.2 ppg with a .518 efg%.  Statistically speaking, his rookie year was about average when compared to his other seasons on the Bulls.  In other words, Michael Jordan came into the league basically a finished product.  A testimony to his talent no doubt.

But if that's the case, then we have a handful of good examples that show how the Bulls performed without him compared to with him.

In 1983/1984 the Bulls finished with a regular season record of 27-55.

In 1984/1985 the Bulls got rookie Jordan (a nearly finished product) and the Bulls improved to 38-44.  An 11 game improvement.

Then, early next season Jordan went down with an ankle injury and the Bulls finished the season with a 30-52 record.  8 games worse than the previous year.

Jordan comes back healthy in 1986/1987 and the Bulls go 40-42.  A 10 game improvement over the previous year.

Fast forward to Michael Jordans surprise early retirement at the height of his powers and popularity .

In 1993 The Bulls go 57-25, when winning their third championship.

Jordan shocks the world (and the Bulls) and retires.  The result?  In 1994 the Bulls go 55-27, and get ousted by the Knicks in 7 games of the second round.  In terms of regular season performance, that's a 2 game decrease over the previous year.

So we have 4 examples showing Michael Jordan was good for +11, -8, +10, -2.

So the greatest player of all time, basically only accounts for roughly +7.75 games on the teams he played for.  Does this seem right to anyone else?

The older I've gotten the more I've started to believe that Hakeem Olajuwan was actually a better basketball player than Michael Jordan.  We don't have similar data to compare as Olajuwan was far more consistent than Jordan but I think most of us can surmise the Houston Rockets would have performed far worse than -7.75 games had The Dream Shake surprisingly not played for a season.

PS: I've done similar research on LeBron James impact on his teams and I've tabulated that he's good for +25.5 games, which is more than 3x the impact Jordan had.

So, can we safely say that Michael Jordan is the most overrated player in the history of the NBA?",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,71279,public,self,Is Michael Jordan the most overrated basketball player of all time?

Moving on, Luka is having an impressive season overall with a 29 point near triple-double averages. Mirroring Westbrook's MVP season but with way better efficiency and worse defense. But arguably even crazier is just how good he has been inside the arc.

As of 21/11/2019 or 14 games in, he is shooting 61.3% on 10.7 attempts inside the arc. To put this into context, he is 8th on 2pt% for players with at least 10 attempts in the last 10 seasons. He is 1st for Guards. All-time he is 17th overall and still 1st for Guards. This is when compared to All-time greats such as Magic Johnson.

Diving even further he is shooting 73% on shots 0-3 feet from the rim, 50.7% on 3-10ft, 56.3% on 10-16 ft, and 75% on 16-3pt. His impressive percentage in long 2s is mainly down to his low attempts there so it should not be taken too seriously. However his percentages in the rim are something else, 22% of his shot comes from the rim and his percentage there is centre-like. 

A big part of why he is so effective on the rim is his improvements in the athletic department. He is very strong for a guard and his amazing touch from his strong floater game seems to have translated to layups. I see him outmuscling his man while in the air and following it up with a sweet touch on the layup. His passing threat also sort of gives him a ""negative spacing""  near the rim where help defence would not commit fully to him, worrying about his throw to the corner. Making his euro step even deadlier.

I believe that should be changed, and that players should be punished more harshly after even just one flop, depending how egregious it is. 

Two nights ago (Nov 18) when the Thunder played at LAC, with the scored tied 86-86 and under 40 seconds to go, Chris Paul dribbled the ball up and out of nowhere deliberately runs into Paul George's body and falls on the ground as if he was shot.  You can see in this video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-\_c6Akv4mLs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_c6Akv4mLs)) at the 10:20 mark. I would have uploaded the video itself but not sure if I can on this post. 

Miraculously he was somehow awarded two free throws and made both, putting the Thunder up 88-86. As you can see in the video, PG-13 did absolutely nothing. The story of the night was PG's clutch 3 to win the game, but had he not made it, the Thunder probably would have won the game because of CP3's BS flop. How the refs awarded that as a foul on the Clippers is beyond me. 

I think players around the league have gotten better in recent years with flopping. I remember at the beginning of the decade when even huge guys like Lebron and Blake Griffin would flop, but I find it ridiculous CP3 is still pulling this bullshit. I honestly think that punishment for flopping in situations like that should be an automatic suspension, beyond even just a simple fine. 

Other players like Harden get called out for ""flopping"" but I think there's degrees to it. What Harden does is bait defenders to jump into his legs, or hit his arms WHILE HE IS SHOOTING, and all defenders know he does this. Harden never just deliberately runs and crashes into unsuspecting defenders while he isn't even attempting to score, like CP3 did on that play. CP3 has a history of this too, it wasn't even that single play ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvDUewrU9Yw&amp;t=3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvDUewrU9Yw&amp;t=3s)). 

What do you all think? Is auto suspension too severe? I haven't seen anyone really discuss the end of that game, but am I making too big a deal out of that play?

I like Jokić a lot and feel like he could probably get back to last season’s numbers, but I just don’t know. He seems exhausted and burnt out after last season, a playoff run, and a World Cup fun. 

Ingram is one of my favorite players to watch, he’s doing really well points wise but he’s kind of injury prone and on a team that isn’t winning much. 

Tristan’s pro/con list is similar to BI, he’s just barely out scoring Jokić, and I’m a Cavs fan, so I like him... I just worry he won’t finish the season in Cleveland due to trade and will drop off the points leader list by the end of the year as a result.

That incident became known as 'Malice at the Palace'.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQIIOWPNYM0

Here is more information about it from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacers%E2%80%93Pistons_brawl)...

&gt;The Pacers–Pistons brawl, colloquially known as the Malice at the Palace and the Basketbrawl, was an altercation that occurred in a National Basketball Association (NBA) game between the Indiana Pacers and the then-defending champion Detroit Pistons on November 19, 2004, at The Palace of Auburn Hills in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The Associated Press (AP) called it ""the most infamous brawl in NBA history.""

&gt;With 45.9 seconds left in the game, Pistons center Ben Wallace went up for a layup, but was fouled by Pacers small forward Ron Artest. Furious at being fouled when the game had already been decided, Wallace pushed Artest, and a fight broke out on the court between several players. After the fight was broken up, a fan threw a drink from the stands at Artest while he was lying on the scorer's table. Artest immediately charged after the fan, but ended up attacking the wrong fan. This led to a massive brawl between players and spectators that stretched from the seats down to the court and lasted several minutes.

&gt;After the game, the NBA suspended nine players for a total of 146 games, leading to the players losing $11 million in salary. Five players were charged with assault, and eventually sentenced to a year of probation and community service. Five fans also faced criminal charges and were banned from attending Pistons home games for life. The fight also led the NBA to increase security between players and fans and limit the sale of alcohol in games.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,71140,public,self,"15 years ago today, the infamous 'Malice at the Palace' happened",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/dysk8w/15_years_ago_today_the_infamous_malice_at_the/,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'vBCQU6Ud0JG9nwtoWqUmBQVUlCvtjIvteAVjmyVWCkk', 'resolutions': [{'height': 81, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/ipVtIJ530YEATYnqLa_iCRATuan7Y9g-xzX1L4IGjac.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b16aeb793435cb1733f7f8de1142aa701f182e43', 'width': 108}, {'height': 162, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/ipVtIJ530YEATYnqLa_iCRATuan7Y9g-xzX1L4IGjac.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b536464b1bf61b2372ebe6a5abae75239373d162', 'width': 216}, {'height': 240, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/ipVtIJ530YEATYnqLa_iCRATuan7Y9g-xzX1L4IGjac.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba66705c25e19b721303a9ddd29f31857adc6781', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/ipVtIJ530YEATYnqLa_iCRATuan7Y9g-xzX1L4IGjac.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=88457dc6dab85cb2fbb53efd431bcb882e88fe6a', 'width': 480}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,1574206182.0,,,,,,,,,,

I fucking love Lauri legend. There hasn’t been a real explanation for his massive drop off in production this season. It’s a bit concerning I’ll explain why.

He’s one of the select few players I’ve seen physically gain that much muscle mass in the league in that short amount of time. As someone who’s been a personal trainer and knows the amount of muscle that his base weight was originally combined with the amount of cardio nba players need it personally has raised more questions then answers. Even with those Finnish god nba genetics it’s been BEYOND impressive.

With the league coming down hard on young stars like Collins (same draft class) and Ayton (went to same university caught for cheating) I can see if Lauri was using an illegal PED that he stopped it. You can’t be naive about life and how much money are actually in line for these athletes to perform at his level. 

I’m pointing this out because the thing he’s been struggling with most is playing inside the ark and banging down low. 

Withdrawing from PED abuse can lead to a massive chemical imbalance and not feeling like yourself at all while playing like being sluggish or slower reaction times.

The discussion in this post got me thinking - wow some of these teams are just beautifully constructed for superstars. 5 out and 4 out 1 in offences are very prevalent and with the spacing they provide they make for very efficient offensive production with NBA defence at it's current state. Imagine 09 Lebron's or 00 Shaq's numbers on the 18-19 Milwaukee in place of Giannis. But as we move in to the next era it seems doubtful that the 3 point shot will go away - instead there will probably be an evolution in how offences are run to produce 3's. Basically I'm claiming the rest of NBA time could be the 3 point era with out rule changes, to call this the 3 point era is probably not specific enough, it's simply because we are in the era we do not know what to name it. I believe these next few seasons will bring much experimentation since there are so many contenders and near contenders as well. This could bring a clear step forward in the game and help us clarify what this time has been.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,71076,public,self,Will we look back on this era as the three point era?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/dyiulq/will_we_look_back_on_this_era_as_the_three_point/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clearly Harden's figured out the playoffs! The only problem with that as a narrative is that the warriors were a terrible defence this postseason. People have repeatedly cited this series as proof he's improved as a playoff player, yet that improvement was non-existent vs the only good defense he played that postseason in the jazz. Against a defense that was a discount version of the bucks(their d rating only went ahead when the bucks started resting giannis and they lack any of the supporting defensive personell giannis has), Harden shot an atrocious 52%ts and the rockets offensive rating fell to a mediocre . If you're wondering how they won in 5, it was on the back of the *#1 Defense post the ASB.* But even those numbers are misleading, because in the first two games the jazz were still trying to figure out how to implement the bucks scheme:

What options are out there for Kevin Love once the silly season gets rolling? He deserves to end up with a contender in my view. He put in for Cleveland, accepted a lesser role, and ultimately got paid - but satisfaction on the grind with Cleveland? I doubt it. 

His contract makes things complicated - same with CP3 (who is in the same situation imho - deserves to finish his career playing playoff basketball).

1. Hayward
2. Millsap
3. Wiggins
4. DeRozan
5. Whiteside
6. Batum
7. Parsons

In their recent game against OKC CP3 and SGA showed how crucial it is to have someone who can run high pick and roll or go 1on1 at a mismatch and get a quality shot. Those two players ability to do that, coupled with the sixers complete inability to, was what won/lost the game last night and has crippled the sixers offense all year. To be clear, by shot creator I mean someone who can create a high quality look either for themselves or their teammates consistently, even during crunch time.

The problem, as I see it is that the sixers built around Ben as a PG, when he is playing the role of a PF (and a 90s era PF at that). This means that they end up effectively having a 2, a 3, two 4s and a 5 on the floor, which is a non-functional lineup.

JRich is a talented player, however he showed in Miami last year that he is not a primary shot creator. Miami gave him the keys to the offense and he wasn't up to the task. That isn't a knock on him, like I said he is a great player but not in that role. If you put him in a position to take open threes and attack close outs he will be very effective. Even if you want him to be a secondary playmaker he can fill that role, but is not a primary shot creator.

You can argue that Tobias has the skills to be a primary shot creator but again I don't think that he is comfortable in that role.  I watch every sixers game and can think of only a handful of plays where he looked confident attacking a mismatch.  He is comfortable in the post against smaller players, but I don't think post ups are reliable enough in crunch time to consistently create good looks   I feel like he is best suited to be the screener in a high pick and roll than the ball handler.  Setting the screen, he can pick and pop or roll and get the looks he's most efficient at.

Joel Embiid can get his own shot, but still really struggles with double teams and his decision making generally. Again, he is an incredible talent but isn't ready or able to be relied on to consistently make the right decision. Like Tobi, I feel like he would be better as the screener, especially with his improved three point shooting. You want him in a position to think as little as possible and either shoot the open jumper or drive and finish, i.e. his main strengths.

All of which brings me to Ben Simmons. In order for the offense to function he needs to start taking shots. All we heard all off season is how much he worked on his shot and ""if it's open I'll take it"". Now is the time to prove it.  Currently every non-transition possession starts with him handing the ball off and moving to the dunkers spot or attempting a post up, both of which make the offense worse.  Either by clogging the lane making it more difficult for other post players, i.e. Embiid or Tobi, or taking post up opportunities away from the same players, who score more efficiently in those situations.  To illustrate this, Embiid currently is among lead leaders the in points per possession on post ups at 1.15, Tobias is at a respectable 0.89 (KAT is at 0.90) and Simmons is at 0.52.

Not only is he negatively effecting the players around him but by playing off ball he is unable to use the talents that make him such a special player: his athleticism, handle and passing.

If he continues to refuse to play as a true PG the sixers struggles will continue.  In my opinion he should be running *at least* 15 high pick and rolls a game and should take whatever shots he is given, most likely pull up 12-15 footers.  Until that happens I don't see any hope for a marked improvement either in his play or the team's.

I do believe that part of the blame lies with Brett for two reasons.  One because it's his job to force Simmons to take these shots.  Again, all off season we heard that Ben was going to shoot, would be taking corner threes instead of hanging out in the dunkers spot and none of that has happened.  The other is that Brett seems obsessed with not running pick and rolls, which just seems asinine at this point.

I've been wanting to carve out a role for myself in the realm of making content for others who share the same passion of the NBA as me. Here's my first, really long-winded NBA article. It's my take on Bucks' decision to not re-sign Malcolm Brogdon, how the Eric Bledsoe extension has aged, and how those two scenarios compare. I know this topic has been spoken about a ton, but I've been working on this for a long while. I would love to hear you positive or negative feedback on my first NBA piece.

Honestly, I can't figure you a better way to share this, so I'm just pasting the story in the text below:

The Milwaukee Bucks ended the 2018-19 NBA season with a league-best 60 regular season wins and only two wins away from their first finals appearance in 46 years. Even after losing the last four games of the eastern conference finals, there’s still plenty of optimism remaining for the organization. They still have the reigning MVP, coach of the year, executive of the year, and most of the starting lineup from their previous recent historic season. Unfortunately, the odd man out from that prolific starting five is 2017 rookie of the year, Malcolm Brogdon.

Leading up to last season, all of the Bucks’ starters except Giannis Antetokounmpo didn’t have a contract secured for this season. Then Eric Bledsoe signed his four-year $70 million-dollar contract on March 4, 2019, which many analysts believed to be a bargain at the time. However, after Bledsoe failed to perform to his capabilities in the playoffs for the second year in a row, owner of The Ringer, Bill Simmons, and other speculators wondered if the Bucks would take that extension back if they could. Obviously, hindsight is 20/20, and keeping a point guard who was producing at a fringe all-star level for less than $20 million annually at the time of the signing will not kill a team’s future to say the least. However, when a team’s aspirations are an NBA championship, their margin of error becomes exceedingly smaller.

Bucks fans fear that Bledsoe’s inconsistent shooting in the playoffs could continue to impede the Bucks’ offense and stop them short of an NBA finals appearance once again. Spacing the floor around Giannis is key to maintaining a top five offensive for years to come, and Bledsoe has the biggest question mark around his shooting respectability among last year’s starting lineup, excluding Giannis. The Bucks ended last season with the fourth-best offensive rating, and through 11 games this year, they rank sixth in that respect. Eventually, the debate in Milwaukee became whether the franchise should’ve bet on the higher ceiling of Eric Bledsoe’s more unique ability to effectively blow up any screen and keep up with the NBA’s elite guards, or the higher floor of Malcolm Brogdon’s efficient shooting and size to defend more positions. Even if it wasn’t clear at the time, Bledsoe signing on the dotted line also meant that Brogdon couldn’t do the same three months later.

Brogdon being a restricted free agent at the end of last season means that the idea of the Bucks’ inability to bring him back is technically a total fallacy. For those unfamiliar, when a free agent is restricted, that means the team that he last played for can “match” any amount that he would agree to with another team, even if that means exceeding the salary cap to keep him. A benefit to letting a restricted free agent go out and seek another offer is avoiding overpaying the player, and usually retaining them at closer to market value with no real risk of unintentionally losing them. That being said, another team with more flexibility and less at stake than a championship contender can still overpay any free agent and acquire a talent they maybe couldn’t by presenting them a salary number they can’t refuse. Therefore, restricted free agency is very much a double-edged sword when dealing with a player who deserves a material amount of the salary cap, but is not at a no-brainer maximum contract level. Sure, it’s troubling to know your team lost an important piece. However, restricted free agency does not exempt any team from luxury tax repercussion. Therefore, if a player’s pay-raise means a loss of flexibility in the future, that could be just as detrimental to long-term success, as losing a quality performer is for the present day.

Not re-signing a player of Brogdon’s quality is certainly not a winning move for the Bucks when solely considering this year’s title hopes. Even the advanced floor spacing and veteran leadership that Wesley Mathews and Kyle Korver bring can’t replace the impact Brogdon had as a secondary ball handler. Especially when looking at the rest of the Bucks’ roster, Mathews and Korver add more to a now redundant strength of the team (shooting), versus replacing what was lost in the offseason (Brogdon’s ballhandling and paint penetration). However, dodging the luxury tax this year can also be seen as a sign of the organization maintaining the long-view, instead of failing to prioritize winning.

Although Brogdon may be less likely to directly cost the Bucks an NBA finals appearance, what some Bucks fans tend to forget is that only $3.9 million of Bledsoe’s $19.375 million salary is guaranteed for his age 32 season in 2022. The sign-and-trade deal that sent Malcolm Brogdon and his brand 4 year/$85 million contract to Indiana included a 2020 lottery-protected 1st round draft pick and 2nd round picks in two consecutive years. Bledsoe clearly has the better contract, and nowadays, teams rarely receive draft compensation from teams taking their players in free agency.

Staying within the margin of error of the modern NBA means optimizing your roster construction to be flexible enough face any team the league with throw at you (a la the current Eastern Conference and NBA champion Toronto Raptors). The roster that eventually broke apart the dynastic Golden State Warriors with five starters who could defend and shoot at at least a respectable level. The Bucks starters are similar now in the way they joined the rest of the league in valuing three point shooting offensively and forcing other teams into taking shots from less efficient areas of the floor. However, last year’s Eastern Conference Finals showed how being outmatched in three-point shooting and shot creation can easily stagnate an NBA offense.

The greatest advantage to having a player like Brogdon, despite the low ceiling of an upperclassman drafted in the second round, is his versatility. In the eastern conference finals, and during the regular season when he was healthy, he showed the ability to seamlessly scale up to the second banana when Middleton and Bledsoe were having off nights, while also fitting in well as a fourth guy, who would spread the floor, and effectively defend wingmen. While thinking of the loss of Brogdon often coincides with the uncertainly of Bledsoe’s performance, maybe speculators should consider if the shorter ceiling of Brogdon’s skillset through the lens of championship aspirations could be just as much, if not more of a hinderance the Bucks’ future title chances.

There seems to be a lot of negative feelings towards the size of Middleton’s new contract, especially when thinking of him as the de-facto second option, but the reality is the possibility of finding another all-star to pair with Giannis in- or out-of-house was much less likely. Brogdon has the skill to step into the role of the second-best player on a 60-win team, but not for 82 games plus playoffs. He also has the ability to defend the other team’s best offensive wingman, but not at an all-defensive level like Bledsoe. He has been surely missed by the organization, but he had to be considered 3rd on the priority list, behind Middleton and Bledsoe, of who the Bucks should’ve re-signed. This is ultimately because he checks a lot of boxes as a jack of all trades, but respectively isn’t more of a master at any skill than the two guys that were above him on the priority list.

Through 11 games, the small-sample-size theater presents Eric Bledsoe producing 17.6-5.5-5.3 on 50-29-80% shooting, and Malcolm Brogdon providing 19-4.8-8 at 46-30.8-98%. Despite the slight drop in efficiency from his 50-40-90% shooting season, Brogdon is proving so far that his able to give really respectable output in an increased role. It’s even more fun now to compare Brogdon and Bledsoe’s career now that they’ve both been in situation with larger roles on non-contending teams (Brogdon- Now Indiana &amp; Bledsoe-Phoenix ’14-’16) and teams with championship hopes (Brogdon - ’19 Bucks &amp; Bledsoe – ’11-’13 Clippers/ ’19-Present Bucks). Bucks and other NBA fans will lose their minds, talking in circles, like myself, comparing the timelines of each player on and off the Bucks’ current roster, but the reality of either player making or breaking the future of the Larry O’Brien trophy residing in the Good Land in overblown. So Bucks fans, like Wisconsin’s other savior said “R-E-L-A-X”. The Bucks ended up with the best, or second-best realistic possible starting lineup post-free agency (depending on how one feels about Brook Lopez (story for another day)). They also sit in comfortable spot to resign the Greek God this summer and have more flexibility to keep a respectable team around him for years to come. Milwaukee wishes their forever-President, Malcolm all the best. They also sincerely regret to hear that he is doubtful for tonight’s contest in Indiana with a sore back per the Pacers' injury report today, and won’t be blessed with the first ever Bledsoe-Brogdon matchup in an NBA contest for even further speculation.

tldr: I've been hearing on podcasts since free agency how the Bucks made a terrible decision not re-signing Brogdon, and it was a decision made while not prioritizing winning.

They’ve started terribly again and there isn’t much to make me think they’ll do anything but remain a bottom feeder in the east. Their defense is one of the worst in the league with Bradley Beal, Thomas Bryant, and maybe Rui looking like about the only starting-caliber players on the team right now. Sounds like about time to get a haul for Beal and start the rebuild right? Maybe, but on the other hand Beal is still 26 with the potential to be a franchise guy for the next 5+ years, they have at least a few nice young pieces, and of course John Wall will be returning sometime in the next year(?). It’s equally conceivable they could ride out wall’s injury, as even when he’s healthy he’s virtually untradeable, and try to compete if he’s still at all-star level. In the meantime they can develop the young guys and get another high pick. This is somewhat reasonable since they were an upper-tier east team in seasons where both Beal and Wall were healthy, but in my opinion they no longer have the supporting cast to to win with that duo in a strengthened conference, and it seems unlikely that they’ll be able to sign any big free agent talent anytime soon. What do you guys think their plans look like for the next ~3 years or so? Are Beal and wall still on this team?

6ers take it as if this side crashes and burns Elton will make a move, and if it crashes and burns the sides fit will be a big culprit (particullary Simmons). A balling out D'lo (if he continues his current production for most of the year)suddenly gives the side a true ""perimeter"" PG and a closer, whilst opening up their spacing. Defence would take a hit, but the additional offence (particullary closing) may offset this for the better.

GS does it as they decide that the Curry/D'Lo backcourt leaks too many points (despite how many point they score), and they struggle to guard sides with big wings (Lakers). Ben boosts their defensive matchups a lot, as he can take the opponents main forward (with Draymond free to float, and Klay on the better guard). GS's offence and Ben would also help each other, with Ben able to operate as a true ""point forward"" within their motion offence (the side would have insane potential for ball movement), whilst also benefiting from the additional spacing allowing him to attack the rim.

Factors with both sides evaluating positions would probably mean this would need to be an end of season trade (cash works better then as well, given simmons salary will allow for matching), and both sides still come out with a potential franchise player who helps them compete immediately.

Personally vast majority of his defensive rebounds are a meaningless stat to me, particularly when Blake wasn’t playing. NBA offenses have never put less of an emphasis on crashing the offensive boards, and Drummond is by far the only capable rebounder on the Pistons roster, so his rebounding numbers fail to impress me in the slightest bit. If he was truly such a great rebounder then Piston’s would be one of the highest ranked team rebounding % teams in the league rather than about league average.

With that being said, I bet my friends that if Andre Drummond ever receives a single vote of MVP in his career, then I would have all four of my pinkies amputated.

I don't think there's one right answer, one definitive list, and even though, for example, Michael Jordan is most commonly considered the NBA's greatest player of all time, one could argue convincingly ""No, it was actually Kareem, and here's why"". Nothing is a knock against any player, it's all a testament to their greatness and their career accomplishments. And that's also what we're comparing, the perception of greatness in the moment, the on-court impact, and even the respective cultural impacts of these players in terms of how they changed the game of basketball. I've watched some classic games, reviewed other rankings, and listened to podcasts, etc., but I can't deny that I'm generationally biased having grown up in the '90s. So comparing '60s players to '90s/'00s players...eh, I'm gonna skew in a direction and ignore a lot of gaudy statistics in many cases based on the evolution of the game.

So without further adieu, here's mine (and I'm fully receptive to disagreement/discussion/analysis, that's what this is for):

1. Michael Jordan (SG) - Greatest of All Time.
2. LeBron James (SF) - Arguably the most intimidating athlete on a basketball court that we've ever seen, and he has some legendary moments of his own (winning in Cleveland), but he also lost 2/4 with a stacked Heat team to Dirk's Maverick's and then Tim's last really good Spurs team, so I do think his ability to make his teammates better is a bit overstated in how it's been more often that his teams came up short in big moments/games than not...
3. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (C)
4. Magic Johnson (PG)
5. Larry Bird (SF)
6. Tim Duncan (PF)
7. Wilt Chamberlain (C)
8. Shaquille O'Neal (C)
9. Bill Russell (C)
10. Kobe Bryant (SG)
11. Kevin Durant (SF) - Opportunity to still climb this list, but I can't say that I fully agree with his leaving GS for a team-up with Kyrie in Brooklyn, in terms of how it's going to help/hinder his legacy. Plus I don't think we've ever seen someone completely come back from an Achilles rupture, have we?
12. Hakeem Olajuwon (C)
13. Stephen Curry (PG) - This is one that I think will keep climbing, even into the Top 10. Greatest shooter I've ever seen, and I think he's been even more important to basketball in the 2010s than LeBron.
14. Karl Malone (PF)
15. Dirk Nowitzki (PF)
16. Oscar Robertson (PG)
17. Julius Erving (SF)
18. Dwyane Wade (SG)
19. Jerry West (SG)
20. Charles Barkley (PF)
21. Kevin Garnett (PF)
22. Elgin Baylor (SF)
23. Isaiah Thomas (PG)
24. John Stockton (PG) - I really wanted Steve Nash in my Top 5 PGs, he was so fun to watch play, but who would I put him over? Certainly not Magic, not Steph, not Oscar, and not Isaiah. So could I really leave the NBA's all-time leader in assists and steals out of that conversation without Nash having led a championship team? Didn't feel that I could do so, even with Nash's MVPs. All of that sounds like a backhanded compliment for John Stockton, granted, but I have nothing but respect for this dude. Growing up a fan of Jordan's Bulls, Stockton scared me in those series, maybe even more so than Malone. He was just pesky, wouldn't go away, always making plays on one end or the other, and as much a competitor as anyone on the court whose name wasn't Michael Jeffrey Jordan.
25. James Harden (SG) - This guy is unreal, offensively. I don't know if he'll ever win a ring, and his defense will likely never be better than average, but even if he hasn't quite passed Clyde Drexler as the 5^(th) best SG as of yet, he's going to, so let me just pencil him in here. And I can ignore Clyde's single ring as he was far from the best player on a Rockets team at that point in his career, having failed to lead the TrailBlazers to a championship in his prime.

TL;DR: James Harden has been the most statistically consistent playoff scorer over the past 7 years. He has been in the top 5 for playoff scoring every year since 2012 (only player in the league to do so) and has been top 3 for 4 of those 7 years (a feat matched only by Lebron and KD). His playoff averages reflect very minor decreases when compared to regular season averages, and his efficiency decreases (-2-3%) are consistent with the rest of the league. The only players whose scoring consistency compares to Harden’s are Kevin Durant and Lebron James, both of whom are regarded as excellent playoff performers. The silly narrative of Harden being a playoff-time choker need to end. 

&amp;#x200B;

\[All data compiled from basketball-reference.\]

You’ve heard it. We’ve all heard it. James Harden is a choker who disappears in the playoffs. No matter his regular season performances, he’ll never be an all-time great due to his dismal playoff performances. I’ve seen it pop up even more over the early part of this season, as Harden’s performance so far this year has been so unbelievable that his critics are left with little recourse but to point forward to the playoffs and ominously warn of his inevitable collapse. I’m looking at you, u/Fax_Kellerman, u/bloothug, and u/Jatni5370 (only a couple examples of a wider problem).

Well… just how bad is Harden in the playoffs? How much does his production really drop from regular season to playoffs? How do his playoff performances compare to the other top players in the league? What about historically? I decided to do what any self-respecting fan should do: research the stats, examine the evidence, and form an educated conclusion.

Let’s just start off by taking a look at Harden’s playoff numbers. For the purpose of this discussion I’m focusing on the years since Harden has been in Houston (starting in 2012-13). The years of OKC throw off the averages for obvious reasons: while he was still a key member of the team, he was coming off the bench and carried much less of the offensive load than he has in Houston. I recognize that people criticize a couple specific series from his years in OKC, but my humble opinion is that his years as the primary offensive weapon for Houston should matter more than his years off the bench. So, for now, I’m sticking to 2012-2019. When someone inevitably whines about the years in OKC, I’ll tackle those. 

**Harden’s Numbers**:

[**http://bkref.com/pi/shareit/QdS6m**](http://bkref.com/pi/shareit/QdS6m)

Since 2012, Harden has averaged 28.2/5.7/7.0/2.0 in the playoffs. His average efficiency over that span has been 41.2% fg with a 50.4% eFG. Those are all average numbers, so here are some minimums: His lowest ppg was 26.3 in. 2013.  His lowest fg% came in 2014, his second year in Houston, at 37.6%. That year was also his highest in minutes played per game, at 43.8. He almost never sat down.

His highest stats for each category were 31.6 ppg (2019), 6.9 rebounds (2019), 8.5 assists (2017), and a whopping 2.4 steals (2016).

How much do those playoff averages differ from his regular season averages? 

[**http://bkref.com/pi/shareit/qDOTx**](http://bkref.com/pi/shareit/qDOTx)

His playoff differential for the major categories when compared to regular season is -1/-0.3/-0.7/+0.3. In other words: his scoring average goes down by a single point when looking at his playoff averages over the past seven years. His rebound and assist numbers go down by less than a point and his steals go up. I was genuinely shocked at the negligible difference here. I expected more of a decrease. His fg% in the regular season averages 44.2% with an eFG% of 52.3% (so you don’t have to look back up the page, his playoff fg% is 41.2 and eFG% is 50.4). Again, we’re talking a difference of 2-3%. Does his efficiency drop in the playoffs? Yes, very slightly. So does the efficiency of nearly every other player in the league. Kawhi Leonard manages to increase his efficiency in the playoffs (on average), but even Lebron’s efficiency drops by \~2% in the playoffs ([**http://bkref.com/pi/shareit/gdV0T**](http://bkref.com/pi/shareit/gdV0T)).    

**Comparisons:**

Since 2012, Harden has been top 5 in playoff scoring every single year. He has never led playoff scoring, but he was second in 2019, third in 2016, third in 2014, and third in 2013.

Here’s the interesting thing: **Harden is the only player to have been top 5 in scoring every year since 2012.** Lebron James was top 5 every year up until 2019, when he didn’t appear in the playoffs. I assume he would have been top 5 again if he played, of course. Kevin Durant also made the top 5 spots for 6 out of those 7 years, with 2015 being his exception. 

Not only that, though: **Harden is the only player to have averaged 26 or more ppg in the playoffs every year since 2012.** This might sound like a cherrypicked stat, but I chose 26 because that was Harden’s lowest scoring average since 2012 (technically his lowest was 26.3, but I wanted to give the league a chance). Admittedly, Durant would have been in this club if he’d played in the 2015 playoffs. He averaged 26+ every other year since 2012. Lebron averaged 26+ every year but 2013…when he averaged 25.9. If he’d played in the 2019 playoffs, I suspect he’d be in this club as well. 

In other words, **the only players to display comparable consistency in playoff scoring to Harden are Lebron and KD.** Even then, Harden has shown that level of consistency one year more than those two all-time great playoff performers. Just for reference, even Kareem never averaged 25+ ppg in the playoffs for 7 years in a row ([**http://bkref.com/pi/shareit/baeDS**](http://bkref.com/pi/shareit/baeDS)).

By the way, Harden also made top five for assists per game in 2015, 2016, and 2017 (alongside Lebron, who made top five all those years and more). 

While it’s true that Harden’s team has never won a final, they have also never missed the playoffs since he came to Houston. Additionally, they have made the WCF twice—losing only to the Warriors—and the semifinals an additional two times. It is my humble opinion, in light of the statistics that I’ve presented, that these losses cannot be placed on James Harden’s shoulders. He has been, quite literally, one of the three best playoff performers over this stretch of time. 

Oh… and he appears to just be getting better. I didn’t even touch on last season’s historic regular season and this year’s unbelievable start.

Now, there will undoubtably be tons of people who dismiss this entire post out of hand based solely on their inability to overcome personal bias against Harden. If that’s you, whatever. I couldn’t care less. If the strong evidence of Harden’s high level of play doesn’t convince you, then I have no regard for your opinion as a basketball fan. For the rest, of you, though: maybe you’ve been persuaded by the more prevalent r/nba narratives regarding Harden. Maybe you genuinely believed that he’s a flopper and choker who collapses under the pressure of the playoffs. If so, this post is for you. My main goal is to show you the evidence that I’ve found which strongly contradicts those narratives. If I can get at least a few people to recognize how good Harden has been and is continuing to be, I’ll be happy. Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: James Harden has been the most statistically consistent playoff scorer over the past 7 years. He has been in the top 5 for playoff scoring every year since 2012 (only player in the league to do so) and has been top 3 for 4 of those 7 years (a feat matched only by Lebron and KD). His playoff averages reflect very minor decreases when compared to regular season averages, and his efficiency decreases (-2-3%) are consistent with the rest of the league. The only players whose scoring consistency compares to Harden’s are Kevin Durant and Lebron James, both of whom are regarded as excellent playoff performers.

But for every successful tank job such the 76ers, there are plenty that take forever to show promise such as the Suns or the Kings, or they rebuild only grow into an average middle of the road team in the case of the T-wolves.  Obviously each struggling team is going to be in a different situation in terms of available assets and so on. But let’s say you’re the GM of a struggling team with no stars demanding a trade,you’re below the salary cap by a couple million dollars, you have all your own picks but no others to start, and with the new lottery odds, getting a top 5 pick seems like a total crapshoot.  As soon as the season ends what do you do?

Personally I’d try to accumulate as many picks as possible particularly in the first round during the first offseason or two of a rebuild.

I’d trade all vets that could help contending teams in exchange for draft picks and get as many as possible.

Second I’d clear the books as much as possible in order to take on bad contracts particularly ones with two-three seasons on them also in exchange for more picks.

The team would most likely be bad for a season or two, but being good or even average probably wouldn’t be feasible even if it were made a priority.  

Fast forward to offseason number three of the rebuild.  After accumulating picks and perhaps making trades to move up as well, the franchise has managed to get two great prospects (think along the lines of guys like Simmons, BI, Siakim, Fox, Tatum, Jaylen Brown etc..).  Knowing those two will demand big money in the following offseason or two after having a team that looks decent mostly due to the performance of those two prospects, I’d do whatever it took to accumulate max contract level players between age 24-28, having approximately three max deals (Ideally), two rookie contracts, and some good value vet min players.

In season four, the franchise is highly competitive and only gets better as the young guys improve.

In seasons 4-8 the team is extremely dominant (possibly even peak Golden State dominant, depending on how many max contracts were able to be accumulated).

Seasons 9-12, the franchise will still be good and competitive but not necessarily super dominant as some of the older players age at a point where the team has been swamped in the luxury tax (which is totally worth it for multiple championships though).  And eventually the franchise begins trading off some of those integral pieces to start the process all over again.  Obviously this all works great on paper, and is a lot easier said and done on paper or in 2K than in real life.

Obviously things can go wrong with this here.  I think the closest example of a front office actually attempting something like this has been the Celtics starting when they made the huge trade with the Mets where they accumulated a ton of picks for an aging KG, Pierce and Jason Terry.  And we all knew that didn’t work as planned due to Kyrie being a bit of a head case and Hayward getting the injury bug (although they are doing well now, just in a much different way they may have envisioned three seasons ago).

Many people look at AST/TO ratio as one metric to grade a primary or secondary ballhandler, which makes intuitive sense - high assist numbers (sort of) display a player's ability to create for others and it is natural that a player will have more turnovers as they try to thread more difficult passes or simply have the ball in their hands more. 

I was thinking about looking at STL/TO ratio, or forced TO as a defender/TO ratio for offensively challenged players such as Thybulle or Andre Roberson. They may turn the ball over more, but clearly they are adding tons of value to the team on defense by getting into passing lanes, forcing turnovers, being in the right spots at a timely manner in order to disrupt actions, etc. Looking at this ratio could more clearly explain why these players are so valuable even if they struggle with the ball in their hands. Also, it is extremely intuitive as well in that every turnover forced on defense (especially a live ball turnover) basically ""makes up"" for a turnover given up on offense.

I always thought Wade was one of the best floor lifters in basketball because of his incredible speed on the ball and his affinity for drawing contact; I even believed he was as great as Kobe at lifting sheer garbage level players offensively. 

So this completely opens up the question; who had the better peak? 

So to start this discussion, here was their ""lift"" stat that I mentioned earlier:

2002-2003 Tmac: 109.3 offensive rating (+5.7 league average), minus 17.5 offensive rating without him. Lead 10th best offense with Pat Garrity, Mike Miller, Armstrong.

2009-2010 Wade: 111.9 offensive rating (+4.2 league average), minus 16 offensive rating without him. Lead 13th best offense with Quentin Richardson, Beasely, Jermaine O Neal, and Haslem.

This is a significant edge for Tracy. He was able to maintain higher offensive impact with HIGHER possession time (Hence why he lead the better overall offensive team), despite slightly worse offensive team. 

Box stats for their 3 year peak (Per 100 possesion): 

2001-2004 Mcgrady: 38/9/7 54.2% TS (+ 2.4 rTS)  8.9% TOV 

2008-2011 Wade: 39.2/7.7/8.8 57.2% TS (+ 3 rTS)  12% TOV 

So Tracy comes out ahead in efficiency with lower scoring + assist output. I would have to lean towards Tracy here as well. 

You couple this with Mcgrady's more ""favorable"" offensive game (Better shooter, provided better spacing and received more fixations than Wade), and I think Mcgrady makes tons of argument as the better peak player.

I always thought Wade was one of the best floor lifters in basketball because of his incredible speed on the ball and his affinity for drawing contact; I even believed he was as great as Kobe at lifting sheer garbage level players offensively. 

So this completely opens up the question; who had the better peak? 

So to start this discussion, here was their ""lift"" stat that I mentioned earlier:

2002-2003 Tmac: 109.3 offensive rating (+5.7 league average), minus 17.5 offensive rating without him. Lead 10th best offense with Pat Garrity, Mike Miller, Armstrong.

2009-2010 Wade: 111.9 offensive rating (+4.2 league average), minus 16 offensive rating without him. Lead 13th best offense with Quentin Richardson, Beasely, Jermaine O Neal, and Haslem.

This is a significant edge for Tracy. He was able to maintain higher offensive impact with HIGHER possession time (Hence why he lead the better overall offensive team), despite slightly worse offensive team. 

Box stats for their 3 year peak (Per 100 possesion): 

2001-2004 Mcgrady: 38/9/7 54.2% TS (+ 2.4 rTS)  8.9% TOV 

2008-2011 Wade: 39.2/7.7/8.8 57.2% TS (+ 3 rTS)  12% TOV 

So Tracy comes out ahead in efficiency with lower scoring + assist output. I would have to lean towards Tracy here as well.

Michael Jordan was undoubtedly the best basketball player in the world throughout the 90's and Lebron has held that title since somewhere in the late 2000's, with Kobe (case could also be made for Tim Duncan IMO) bridging the gap.

TL;DR Players should be given more resting time because it makes them play better.  

Did anyone notice how when certain players are given resting time they usually come back even better than they were before?  

Like how Kawhi was able to lead a team almost completely foreign to him to a championship this year after taking time off to recover from his injury

 Or how Michael Jordan and his team had that record-breaking 72-10 season the year he  came back for another full season.      

\[Possibly NBA players even agree with the points I am making seeeing as how resting time has increased over the years\]([https://howtheyplay.com/team-sports/The-Problem-With-The-NBA-Resting-Players](https://howtheyplay.com/team-sports/The-Problem-With-The-NBA-Resting-Players))  

The problem with resting players more often as the author of the above article states is that it leads to people coming to games which they are promised the chance to see a player but then they don't get  the chance to see that player. That is a legitimate problem which has an  easy solution which Adam Silver himself already knows the solution to.  

Just handle the injuries of players more seriously.   Resting players more is part of this solution.

\- \[A while back Adam Silver had proposed that the NBA season be only 70 games\]([https://sports.yahoo.com/adam-silver-star-game-didn-011947812.html](https://sports.yahoo.com/adam-silver-star-game-didn-011947812.html)) . 

 The only reason why that idea fell through is cause it would cost the players and the league money due to less home games.    

\- \[Stephen Curry even admitted that he was not 100% during the time when his team blew a 3-1 lead in the Finals\]([https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/warriors-stephen-curry-on-the-finals-i-wasnt-100-percent-but-who-cares/](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/warriors-stephen-curry-on-the-finals-i-wasnt-100-percent-but-who-cares/)) .  

 Ever notice how that was the season that he and his team beat the Bulls record for win rate? The amount of strain of that offseason and the championship prior had put on the players was probably what lead to the GSW's demise. The  Warriors beat the Cavs twice in the Regular season in 2015-16 just as the Raptors had this season for the GSW, in the GSW's second time they nuked the Cavs for a 40 point difference . The framework and strategy on how to beat the Cavs was there. They had all the pieces they needed to do it again. Steph, Klay , Draymond and even Igoudala were there. But what was not there was an injury free team. Though he enjoyed playing he could have caused himself permanent injury like Kevin McHale did in 1989. Kevin McHale was never the same player after that season all because he wanted to 'take one for the team'.  'Taking one for the team' isn't always a bright idea. That could have happened to Steph. Heck, we all saw what happened when Durant decided to take one for the team and play in Game 6. Now he is out for a whole season. He may never come back as the same player.  \[In the Finals before that one the shoe was on the other foot. The GSW were more healthy and Irving and Love's injuries played a part in the downfall of the Cavs that season.\]([http://archive.nba.com/2015/news/features/shaun\_powell/06/17/5-things-we-learned-from-the-finals/index.html](http://archive.nba.com/2015/news/features/shaun_powell/06/17/5-things-we-learned-from-the-finals/index.html))  In a interview after Pippen and Michael were on the 'Dream Team' Pippen admitted to cutting games because he knew they were not 100% after playing in the Olympics. Ofcourse you can criticize them ...but their cutting worked as they proceeded to win the championship that year; however the Bulls had their worst ' dynasty record'  that year.

\- \[We are even seeing a trend of injury in younger non-NBA players\]([https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/27125793/these-kids-ticking-bombs-threat-youth-basketball](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27125793/these-kids-ticking-bombs-threat-youth-basketball))  

  In the above article it is shown how Michael never even picked up a basketball or did any kind of workout during his offseason. This probably led to a better rested body than his opponents which probably meant he could handle the strain of a three-peat better than them.

\[On 8th of November this year LA Clippers coach Doc Rivers was fined for lying  on the status of Kawhi Leonard as not concerning as to why he was benched in a loss against the Milwaukee Bucks\]([https://sportstar.thehindu.com/basketball/basketball-nba-los-angeles-clippers-fine-kawhi-leonard-injury-update-inconsistency-shock/article29925015.ece](https://sportstar.thehindu.com/basketball/basketball-nba-los-angeles-clippers-fine-kawhi-leonard-injury-update-inconsistency-shock/article29925015.ece))     

Kawhi is being asked to play and even he knows he is not 100%.  Wait! Isn't that the situation he was caught in back in 2015 when he was injured by Zaza and just didn't want to play but was continually asked to play? Could this lead to what we saw The Terminator go through back in San Antonio? Possibly.    

  

1. I think that the NBA should give its players a alternating resting time type of schedule that alternates. Like every 2 seasons there is a 'no-season' where players get mandatory surgery, get them selves therapy if they are going through anything(we have seen players leave due to psychological issues before have we not?) , get their family life sorted out, or do whatever it takes to play at 110% , allow their bodies to rest, etc...

2. And NBA seasons should be shortened to 70 or even 67 games.

Early in the season the Sixers have struggled on offense and some think they may be less of a contender than preseason predictions had them at. I agree that some of this early season play has been concerning on the offensive end. Time to gel and get right definitely explains some of it, but I think looking ahead two big things will be important if they want to win a championship. 

1. Joel needs to get better at passing out of double teams. Embiid gets doubled by a lot of teams as soon as he catches the ball or if he makes a move toward the basket. It’s actually fairly predictable that the double will come because most teams do it. If Embiid can improve his passing from this spot and lower his turnovers there it would really help the rest of the team. It would result in mismatches all of the court from hitting a cutter or an open guy for a 3 or creating hockey assists and forcing perfect defensive rotation to stop an open shot or drive. Right now Embiid is definitely working on that, but improvement there would be huge for this offense which struggles to get open looks in the half court right now. 


2. Simmons needs to start shooting the corner three. Being able to run sets where Simmons is in the corner and a moderate threat would open up space for pick and roll and pick and pop with Embiid and Horford setting screen and Richardson and Harris ball handling. Could add a new dynamic to the spacing and even if it’s a below league average corner 3 hitting those will be important. This season Ben has Ben videoed taking the corner three in warmups before every game and I definitely think some in game attempts are coming and could really propel this team. Ben does does so many things well already that his shot doesn’t have to be money from every spot. But in the corner forcing close outs on him to drive around, knocking down some open ones, and providing more spacing and probably offense rebounding crashing the glass from there would be great. Like how James Ennis is so successful getting rebounds from corner. I liken Ben’s improvement a lot to Siakams from last year, Siakam wasn’t really a deadly shooter from all over the court, but his corner three was crucial to the Raptors in the playoffs. Obviously Simmons isn’t going to be Danny Green or Kyle Korver from the corner but I think being able to hit from the corner would be a big step for him and his game.

Building off of that I think adding the corner 3 for Ben would really open up Harris and Richardson’s game a little bit where Ben can take a break from being the primary ball handler and creator and let those guys work a little bit and hopefully be able to mesh their games with the team more as the season goes on. The size of our team creates a lot of mismatches and Ben off ball cutting from the corner of people actually go out to him would help these guys play make some more.

These are just my thoughts on what I think I’d like to watch for and see as improvement this season.

What do you guys think about the Sixer’s so far. Are they real? Do they need these improvements to get past the second round? Make the finals? Win the finals?

If the Lakers play him with Lebron AT ALL it is a disturbingly stupid decision. The only way he can maybe contribute is for post entry passes to AD while Lebron is out, other than that he is USELESS. 

Rondo is also a diva and if his minutes get cut he might start throwing tantrums in the lockeroom. I have no idea why the Lakers resigned him, they are better off with Caruso, which isn't saying much, but at least Caruso can defend. 

I am genuinely worried that even 18 mpg of Rondo could detail an elite defensive team, and whatever playmaking he provides will not be enough to outweigh that.

As the NBA season has started, I wanted to make my bi-annual awareness post of the NBA API Client that I created for Python last year. I believe this to be a useful tool for people to utilize that want to get familiar with data analysis and Python. It will help in any custom analysis by gathering the necessary data to get us some quality original content!

This NBA API Client follows the same structure as the APIs on [NBA.com](https://NBA.com). I created a tool that helps me map and analyze endpoints from [stats.nba.com](https://stats.nba.com). In my opinion this is most extensive public documentation for NBA Stats endpoints. All of this information can be found in easy to follow documentation. And if you find a way to make it better, feel free to create an issue.

Currently, I have mapped out 110 Endpoints that are available on [stats.nba.com](https://stats.nba.com).

Tonight I just watched the end of the Spurs-Grizzlies game. In a very tight game down the stretch, DeRozan drives into the paint and is met by 3 Memphis defenders. He attempts a reverse layup but gets a lot of contact and can't finish. The Grizzlies pick it up and score in transition. On the replay, it looks like Valanciunas pretty clearly fouled DeRozan on the drive.

On the next Spurs possession, DeRozan attempts a straight line drive, jumps and is met by a Memphis defender, but it looks like DeRozan mostly went around him. They call the foul immediately. On replay it looks like DeRozan barely made any contact with the defender, if that. The Grizzlies challenge, and the foul is overturned.

On the second play, it's obvious to me that the refs called a make-up foul. Not all refs do this, and I don't think any would say it out loud, but sometimes when they know they got a call wrong, they'll do either a make-up foul or make-up no-call depending on the situation.

In this instance, two incorrect decisions were made, one by mistake and then one intentionally to make up the first mistake. The Grizzlies had the ability to challenge the second mistake, and they won. The Spurs did not have the ability to challenge the first.

What's the reason why coaches aren't allowed to challenge non-calls?

Elite players will add value to their clubs no matter what the context, but most players (*including most All-Stars*) tend to be one or the other. 

A floor-raiser would be someone who can ""do it themselves"" and pull a bad team up a few pegs, often making a team a regular playoff contender -- generally a ball-dominant scorer. A ceiling-raiser would be someone with skills that don't become redundant (*which is the case for ball-dominant scorers*) --skills like finishing, shooting, passing, spacing-- and adding this player to an already average or good team will help make them great, often helping make them regular championship contenders. 

An easy example from today's NBA is Russell Westbrook (floor-raiser) compared to Draymond Green (ceiling-raiser). You want to make a bad team respectable? Add Westbrook. You want to make a good team great? Add Green. 

**Who are some historic players who strike you as being particularly one or the other?** 

I'll throw a couple out there to get the discussion started. **Dennis Rodman** is an obvious ceiling-raiser since there's no way he's turning a bad team around, but he can make a good team into an elite team.

Just the other day, after the Celtics beat the Hornets 108-87 in Kemba's return to Charlotte, Kenny Smith said something along the lines of ""if the loss is &gt;7, it's on the players. If it's &lt;7, it's on the coach."" Shaq went on to disagree, saying ""coaching doesn't have anything to do with it"".  **This got me thinking, who do you blame for a team's failure during a game? And who do you blame for long term failure?**

As many of you may have seen, after a win against the Dallas Mavericks this past Friday night, the New York Knicks suffered an embarrassing home loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers 108-87 (same score as Celtics-Hornets, coincidence?), making their record fall to 2-8 in what seems like another lost season with barely a sliver of hope going forward, other than another 14% chance at the number 1 draft spot (So much for this team bringing back the ""Old School 90s Knicks Basketball"" mentality and ""protecting the Garden"", especially since that era of NYK basketball was known for their defense, because defense was nonexistent in this game, where they allowed CLEs second-year Sexton to drop 31 in MSG).  As a result of the loss, fans at MSG starting chanting ""Fire Dolan"" in response to the Knicks owner (and seemingly a tyrant as well) James Dolan, and the fan that started that chant was later escorted out of his seat by security.  Soft move by Dolan in my opinion to have a fan thrown out for ""saying fire the owner"" in a blowout loss to another bad team; everyone should be entitled to free speech, especially a paying fan of a team that's sucked for years. 

After the game, the team's President Steve Mills and GM Scott Perry call an impromptu press conference where they address the media by saying they're ""not happy"" and that the team is ""not performing to the level they expected"".   They went on addressing the media, stating the obvious about the team's play and so on.  (Also as I was writing this I got a notification that said Mills is now ""angling to fire David Fizdale"".)  Through these times for the Knicks, it makes me wonder: **when do you blame the team's failures on the players, when is it the coach, the GM, President, or owner?** 

In the Knicks' case, it seems that all signs point to James Dolan not knowing how to be a good owner of an NBA team.  Since their Finals appearance in 1999, they've missed the playoffs 13 (looking like 14) times in 20 years, and the only times they've made the playoffs they can't get out of the first round (except for 2013 when they lost in the second round).  As a result, Dolan seems to be the main reason as to why they've been such a laughing stock for so long.  Many Knicks fans, though, disagree on who's to blame for the poor start to the season.  Some say Fizdale and his inability to coach the young guys with the vets, others say its Mills poor job at being president of the team.  Which leads to my other question: **Does the president of the team really have that much of an impact on a team's performance?  The front office and head coaching position of the Knicks has changed so much in recent years, how can you point a finger at one person?** 

When I look at other teams, I wonder if they're success is coming from ownership, coaching, front office, or just straight balling out from players, and I wonder how the lesser teams in the NBA could achieve that.  Especially with the Lakers, I'm curious to see how they turn out after several sub-par seasons and missing the playoffs, given the amount of talent they have between Lebron and Davis, as well as the amount of drama that took place over the offseason with them, like Magic stepping down, failing to hire Ty Lue as coach, and so on.  I'm looking forward as to what happens to the Lakers this year, with amazing talent on the court and a not-as-functional front office as one would hope to have.  

In my opinion, I think that a team's dysfunction is really dependent on the owner more than anything else, at least in the Knicks case that is.  When I look at the Clippers owner Steve Ballmer, he seems like a guy that players want to play for, and that is a big reason as to why Kawhi and PG13 came to that LA team.   I also believe Doc Rivers played a big role in recruiting those two stars, but Ballmer seems to have his franchise figured out.  This seems to be opposite of the Knicks case, where players have come out and said they like the front office guys and the head coach, but they did not want to play for Dolan's team (I'd mention the whole KD situation but I don't know the exact details).

Even for him to do that, he had to be the best shooter and second best PG of all time. There’s no doubting how he’s one of the most skilled at that position of all time.

Portland who are constant hitting a wall.

It's pretty hard to trade Sabonis, I think, because he was just extended and it's hard to match contracts. I also think he's a better fit for the Pacers than Turner, they need his rebounding, his screen-setting, and playmaking. Turner's shooting is valuable, but when the Cavs trapped Oladipo in that playoff series, he was too indecisive as a decision maker, and I don't think he's improved enough on that end. 

Ingram gives them another ball-handler and shooter, he's young still. Brogdon has been surprisingly great with the ball in his hands, but Ingram gives them a better scoring option without Oladipo. They can time it so they always have two of Brogdon/Oladipo/Ingram out there, plus when you have all three + Sabonis out there, it's just a lot of passing, finishing, shooting and all-around skill. 

Turner is an ideal fit next to Zion - he doesn't need the ball, he can shoot, opening up space for Zion inside, and protects the rim. There's like... five of those guys in the league. Ingram has been great, but he's going to get paid, and Turner is on a great contract.

Notes:

1. There are actually 101 games on  [this list](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_game.html). This is because there were more games equal to games in the Top 100, and so they can't ""kick"" any games off of the list. 
2. Wilt Chamberlain is 34/49 in top 100 scoring games, losing 15.
3. There has been one game that had multiple players score enough to enter the top 100 scoring games list: December 8, 1961, when Wilt Chamberlain scored 78, Elgin Baylor scored 63 and the Lakers beat the Warriors 151-147. Baylor shot .418% and Wilt shot .500%
4. Of the four 67-point games Wilt Chamberlain has, he lost three. No other player has a 67-point game.
5. James Harden is on the Single Game Points leaders list six times, but has only one loss.
6. Kobe Bryant is on the Single Game Points leaders list seven times, but has only one loss.
7. Michael Jordan is on the Single Game Points leaders list six times, and has two losses.
8. Devin Booker is on the Single Game Points leaders list twice, losing both times.
9. Current NBA players on this list are 9/15 in these high scoring games.
10. It was quite hard to work quickly on this, as I got confused when Wilt played for the San Francisco Warriors, Philadelphia Warriors, Philadelphia 76ers and Los Angeles Lakers, but also lost some of these high-scoring games to the Philadelphia 76ers and Lakers.
11. The Lakers have played ""spoiler"" to five of these high-scoring games, all of which against Wilt Chamberlain.

Notable people include Skip Bayless, Stephen A, etc. Sooner or later someone is gonna have an injury that could have been avoided, like KD in the finals. I know KD said he wanted to play but you can’t convince me that it wasn’t at least partly people going “KD is quitting on his team he’s out the door”. 

People love to always say “Jordan played 82 games every year”, yeah but didn’t he also have like 2 or 3 major injuries? And he sat out 2 years in the middle of his prime to play half seasons of minor league baseball. So all in he missed like 3 or 3.5 seasons? 

Larry Bird only lasted 12 years. Kobe was awful his final 3 seasons. T mac was done by like 28, the list goes on. Lebron who consistently delivers 70+ games per season and will possibly outlast anybody ever, was hugely criticized for sitting out games a few years ago. And then in 2018 he plays 82 and what happens? He gets injured and misses 27 games the next season.  Load management absolutely would have helped any of these guys.

So I guess it’s all about perspective. Instead of being mad about Kawhi sitting out 2 games, realize that him sitting could prevent an injury that keeps him out for 50 games. I realize it isn’t fair for fans buying tickets to see him play, but that should be fixed another way, maybe the NBA introduces an insurance refund policy or something. People need to stop saying “this era is soft” because frankly it isn’t true.

They’ll also have to clear up cap space to get some good rotation players (think robert covington, joe ingles, etc.) And clearing up cap space is going to be hard, because they’re paying steph and klay huge contracts. And there’s still draymond’s extension. They might trade d-lo and dray for picks, and either use those picks to make a big splash or do the rebuild that started it all again.

I want to know what the differences are between the bayesian adjusted box score stats.

What are the primary differences between these box score stats? What do these differences show?

For example in baseball, the two big iterations of WAR (wins above replacement) are from fangraphs and baseball-reference.

When calculating the pitcher's WAR they have the same goal, but use different methods.

Fangraphs uses FIP, which only takes account strikeouts, infield popups, walks and homers to calculate WAR for pitchers,

while bb-ref uses RA-9 (runs allowed per 9) and adjusts that for the team's defense.

Both are trying to isolate the pitcher's impact, but the two numbers show different thigns - fangraphs' WAR assumes that the pitcher cannot control the balls in play (BABIP- batting avg on balls in play).

Baseball-reference simply takes the runs allowed and adjusts for the level of the team defense behind the pitcher.

Overall, fangraphs tend to under-rate groundball pitchers, while baseball-reference's defensive stats can create some wonky gaps between some pitchers' evaluations.

Now that T-Mobile Arena has been built, Las Vegas has been primed for sports franchises, with the NHL’s Golden Knights capitalizing on the opportunity. There’s already professional basketball in Las Vegas with the WNBA’s Aces, but they play in the nearby suburb of Paradise rather than in downtown Las Vegas. Despite the absolute insanity that was the 2007 All-Star Game, Las Vegas has maintained its hold as the official summer league of all thirty NBA teams. Black Knight Sports &amp; Entertainment is actually the perfect group to start an NBA franchise, with the consortium’s first venture experiencing immediate success. The Vegas Golden Knights have quickly established themselves as a top-tier organization, which would be encouraging to the other NBA owners. Another thing that is encouraging is the major half of the consortium, the Maloof family. The Maloofs have owned both the Houston Rockets from 1979 to 1982 and the Sacramento Kings from 1998 to 2013. With an arena in place and an ownership group with sports pedigree, this might actually happen sooner rather than later.

&amp;#x200B;

Louisville

&amp;#x200B;

Louisville is such an interesting prospective NBA city to me because cities like these is where the NBA absolutely thrives. I can easily see Louisville being a team in the same vein as Salt Lake City or San Antonio, a small market that rallies around its only major pro sport. One of the biggest benefits of Louisville would be the ability to serve both southern Ohio and Kentucky. Louisville is less than two hours from Cincinnati, Ohio and an hour and a half from Lexington, Kentucky. This is another city with an arena in place, the KFC Yum! Center. Although used for college basketball, this arena is the largest basketball arena in the United States built right on the water of the Ohio River. If used by the right team, Louisville NBA could be a crown jewel of basketball in the south. There’s a strong basketball heritage in the state, both by the University of Kentucky basketball program and the ABA’s Kentucky Colonels. Five Hall of Famers played for the ABA stalwart and eleven Hall of Famers represent the university. I’d like to see Carl Linder III and his ownership group build a team in Louisville. His group has started the FC Cincinnati soccer club in 2015 as USL (American soccer’s second tier) club and in four short years, they reached the MLS, the highest level in America. If he chose to take his talents to Louisville, we could have a really fun team in an underrated city.

&amp;#x200B;

Montreal

With Toronto finally winning a championship, it’s time to take the NBA to the great white north again. Montreal seems like a natural fit for Canadian expansion, with an immediate rivalry between Ontario and Quebec reminiscent of the Maple Leafs-Canadiens rivalries in the NHL. There’s such a cultural difference between the two provinces and cities, that the Raptors being the de facto Canadian national team might grow a movement in the rest of Canada that could be cultivated by one big star, similar to Vince Carter in Toronto. There’s a bit more risk here since there is no longer a Montreal franchise in the National Basketball League of Canada. However, that league began play in 2011 and early foldings are to be expected. The Molson family is a natural fit to run the franchise, with their ties to Montreal running deep. The Bell Centre is currently the home of the Canadiens and the ownership group that owns the stadium also runs the hockey team that fills it. Of the six preseason games that occurred in the Bell Centre, they were all sellouts. If that can be sustained over forty-one games, likely with more downs than ups due to being an expansion team in a city used to winning is the major question.

&amp;#x200B;

Seattle

Do I need to explain why Seattle needs a team? The SuperSonics were NBA royalty for over forty years, before Clay Bennett moved the franchise to Oklahoma City in business-savvy yet opportunistic move. There’s an alternate universe out there somewhere where Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant are the next big tag team in Seattle, following in the footsteps of Lenny Wilkens/Spencer Haywood and Gary Payton/Shawn Kemp. The former home of the Sonics, the KeyArena, is currently under redevelopment under the name Seattle Center Arena and if redevelopment goes well, we should expect a team in the near future. The Seattle Storm have maintained a presence in Seattle as a proud WNBA franchise, whose owners could make a great group to run the NBA side. Eleven families have stake in the Seattle Sounders MLS team, who are the most valuable franchise in MLS. The three businesswomen who make up Force 10 and run the Seattle Storm would be an amazing group with any of the families who invested in the Sounders, hopefully bringing basketball back where it belongs in the Pacific Northwest.

&amp;#x200B;

Vancouver

The Vancouver Grizzlies were kind of a failure. Lasting only six seasons before moving to Memphis, they were barely a blip in the radar of NBA history. The NHL’s Canucks were sold alongside the Rogers Centre in 2004 to the Aquelini group and with new developments going up around the arena, the NBA should be looking to make a return. A lot of the reasons I’d like to see Vancouver rejoin the NBA are similar to Montreal’s, but 4000 miles away. The Canucks have experienced more success recently as well as the Vancouver Whitecaps FC, with supporters reaching over 15000 in just their second MLS season. If Vancouver can last more than six seasons in a rebirth, it’d be a success. Having a face like Steve Nash joining the ownership group would be perfect as a liaison for the NBA and I think they could rebuild the image of basketball in British Columbia.

&amp;#x200B;

Virginia Beach

I have a soft spot for Hampton Roads. After living there a few years and seeing how fans from seven different cities mobilized for their respective teams, I really want to see how they’d rally around a local team. The only arenas in the area are the Norfolk Scope and Hampton Coliseum, which aren’t really NBA-caliber arenas. I’m OK with a team in Richmond, which is about an hour away from Hampton Roads, but the Kings were in negotiations to move to the area from 2011 to 2013. Virginia Beach is kind of the ultimate small-market team in this list because this team would be starting from scratch. There’s no major team in the area, only various minor league teams, and an arena desperately needs to be built in order to make it happen. An arena could revitalize the area and doesn’t necessarily need to be on the waterfront. There was an arena plan that failed, but I think this is an “If-you-build-it-they-will-come” situation. The Virginia Squires are another ABA team who existed and with the pedigree of Julius Erving, George Gervin, Charlie Scott and Zelmo Beaty in the Hall Of Fame, there is a place for basketball. There’s almost 400 miles of real estate between Charlotte and Washington DC, fertile for a new fanbase to join the NBA.

&amp;#x200B;

Honolulu, Mexico City and San Juan

If Las Vegas receives an NBA team, it makes sense to move the Summer League to a new city. Honolulu is a great place to stay for ten days, despite my bias from growing up in Hawaii. Honolulu can’t really support a team consistently, but is great for events and one-offs similar to the Pro Bowl. Mexico City would be a good place for international expansion, as would San Juan. A quick ten-day trip in an established vacation spot makes a ton of sense as a replacement.

&amp;#x200B;

G League

Each of the teams have a few options as far as G League affiliates. The G League is the minor league of the NBA and the cities mentioned each have options. Las Vegas could resurrect the Reno Bighorns, Louisville could bring back the Arkansas RimRockers or the myriad of teams in the Carolinas. Montreal could bring back the Springfield Armor or put a team in Quebec City. Seattle has options in Bismarck, Boise or Tacoma. Vancouver could build in Calgary or the other teams in the Great Plains and Midwest. Virginia Beach could also use the Carolinas teams or bring back the Roanoke Dazzle.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion

I did this in NBA 2K19 and expanded with all six teams at once as a sort of reboot for the NBA. Free agency when every team has a maximum of eight players besides draftees would be insane and it would give the NBA a chance to restructure the divisions to a more geographically sound, cost-efficient way. NBA 2K19 puts the expansion teams right behind the top three teams in the draft, which makes sense, and is fair for the top three lottery picks. NBA owners are reportedly talking about a $2 billion entry fee to own a franchise, but the only team in the NBA that didn’t turn a profit were the Cleveland Cavaliers, who lost the biggest star of our generation, taking millions of revenue with him. The NBA would have a chance to do something unprecedented and I think the expansion draft of players with six teams could result in major stars moving as well as some up-and-comers having the cleanest of slates. NBA expansion is a very exciting prospect to me, on and off the court and seeing the league evolve both in business and in gameplay is something that could change sports forever.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,70134,public,self,The Six Cities Most Deserving Of NBA Expansion,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/dtqpw3/the_six_cities_most_deserving_of_nba_expansion/,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '1_t7zd3W_ThbUJqteKhsYGkCC9GOzn2pjr7s9-p9Z_8', 'resolutions': [{'height': 60, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/NgNXbF8uMoCtMKG_HlP1zzgqFPnVSM-vgKgBQ07Z1n8.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=636532f88414675b5b8e8fd33a223ded77f28d27', 'width': 108}, {'height': 121, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/NgNXbF8uMoCtMKG_HlP1zzgqFPnVSM-vgKgBQ07Z1n8.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f1067c429da701d4f1302b7d6c1452d3e45e61f', 'width': 216}, {'height': 180, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/NgNXbF8uMoCtMKG_HlP1zzgqFPnVSM-vgKgBQ07Z1n8.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc10c4090e8425136d0a281d0df56b1ce0c373d2', 'width': 320}, {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/NgNXbF8uMoCtMKG_HlP1zzgqFPnVSM-vgKgBQ07Z1n8.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9975425aed9034cca3688c2ccf77d05e40851ada', 'width': 640}, {'height': 540, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/NgNXbF8uMoCtMKG_HlP1zzgqFPnVSM-vgKgBQ07Z1n8.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc942d9ddeca7068e6afb61e3cedd540ed605084', 'width': 960}], 'source': {'height': 563, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/NgNXbF8uMoCtMKG_HlP1zzgqFPnVSM-vgKgBQ07Z1n8.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=5943796637a45478ac8f378b8754d4a3e87bb1d9', 'width': 1000}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rockets gain talent but lose rim protection, and tbh its their defence which has looked the worse than their offence. Its definitley a roll of the dice move if things are not working.

He was an absolute monster in the preseason, for what it's worth. It's the highest level of competition we've seen him play and he was unstoppable and visibly adjusting to NBA caliber athletes and defensive schemes AND the Pelicans playbook. 23.3 ppg on 71% isnt an accident.

That being said, the Pelicans have been disappointing, to say the least. The ""We're Not Anthony Davis"" trio is playing well; Brandon Ingram is out of his mind right now and both Josh Hart and Lonzo look good. That's about it aside from Jrue's slow start and Redick shooting like the cheat code he is.

So what will Zion's presence do to this team? 

Offensively he's going to put a lot of pressure on opposing defenses and get a ton of putback opportunities that Nico Melli couldn't dream of. His playmaking from the post will give Brandon Ingram or JJ Redick lots of great looks. Oh, and the transition game is going to be unreal with him and any combo of Lonzo, Jrue, even Ingram.

His biggest impact might be on defense though. The pelicans defense has been decent this year but Zion interrupting every passing lane and blocking shots he has no business being close to, it will get dramatically better.

I  just want the fans to be taken care of. If the reason for price  increases are because Marquee players have signed, and are now on the  team, and they are not playing, then what is the justification for  increased prices? I get it. Players don't want to get hurt, they want  long term health and don't want to be walking around like charles  barkley in the future. There is nothing wrong with that. Either give the  fans discounts, or their money back though. If not, then pay the  players for games played and move along.

Imagine  buying a ticket to the Victory tour headlining Michael Jackson in 1984  and MJ himself saying or the operators saying, MJ may or may not  perform, but we are not giving you the dates, and oh, all the tickets  are the same astronomical price. Wouldn't go so smooth right? You pay to  see the victory backup singers and dancers and not MJ and his thriller  hits going god mode moonwalking and circle walking and wind walking, and  the beat it jacket etc, at the same price as the shows MJ actually does  show up. How would that ever work? It would be an outrage. Players get  their rest, and fans keep their money is how this should be handled.

So are there any similar parallels fellow subscribers can relate to this? I think everyone can win if they just start factoring in fan discounts. 

Before anyone says, ""You pay to see the team play, not 1 player."" That is not exactly accurate. The NBA has been marketing individual players since the modern era started with Magic and Larry. The selling point wasn't the teams anymore, but the individual personalities and players. Superstars are intrinsic to the value of ticket prices and what fans ultimately pay. 

YES there are people that are still fans of teams (Die hard Knickerbockers) but this mentality of paying to see the team, is not accurate. That wasn't the NBA marketing strategy for the past 3 decades now. With no notable rivalries existing due to Superstars being the focal point, and guys moving around to multiple teams every season/yearly, you can't really sell the team as the product. There is no history or buildup of value if the guys move so much and the superstars are the selling point.

If clippers struggle with playmaking rebounding and assist numbers Ben Simmons could be an excellent addition for them. A line up of Beverley, PG, Kawhi, Simmons and Harrell would be quite useful on defence. 76ers gain shooting and a perimeter shotmaker/closer that is now proven in the playoffs - though Lou Williams is not overly interested in a trade i actuacclly believe he would not be too unhappy with the 76ers as a destination - he could even be offered a starting role, his lack of ability to defend drives should be at least partially marginalised by Embiids rim protection.

This triggered a thought in my mind - *Suppose I am buying tickets to an NBA game and I want to see a star/superstar play. Which star/superstar is the most guaranteed to put on a show, and more importantly, least likely to be load managed/injured?*


Obviously, one of the first players that came to mind was Karl-Anthony Towns. It seems like unless he gets hit by a car or choked out by Embiid, he's going to show up and he's going to get buckets. 


To do a more quantitative and comprehensive approach, I came up with the following criteria. I wanted to look for players under age 30 (younger players get load managed less) who had the most seasons with at least [**75 GS** (~90% of the season), **30 MPG**, **20 PPG**, **0.5486 TS%**]. I searched only the past 4 seasons (since 2015-16) to ensure that the results were recent enough to serve as a basis for forecasting. The 0.5486 TS% was the league average across the previous 4 seasons.


I chose those particular criteria because I believe most casual fans would probably like to see a guy who can score the basketball, do it relatively efficiently, play most of the game, and have at least a 90% probability of actually playing. Whether or not you believe these stats correlate perfectly with winning basketball, they do represent a player that can do those 4 things.


Using these qualifiers, I did a simple query of Basketball Reference's Total Season Finder. 
[Here are the results:](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=total&amp;type=totals&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;per_poss_base=100&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;is_active=Y&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;year_min=2016&amp;year_max=2020&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=0&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=gs&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=75&amp;c2stat=mp_per_g&amp;c2comp=gt&amp;c2val=30&amp;c3stat=pts_per_g&amp;c3comp=gt&amp;c3val=20&amp;c4stat=ts_pct&amp;c4comp=gt&amp;c4val=0.5486&amp;order_by=ws)

For the lazy, **Kemba Walker** and **Paul George** have done this all 4 of the past 4 seasons. **Bradley Beal**, **Damian Lillard**, **Klay Thompson**, **James Harden**, and **Karl Anthony-Towns** have done it thrice in the past 4 seasons. Look for when these players are coming to town if you want to avoid being disappointed by load management.

 

**FINAL NOTE:** If you remove the TS% qualifier, **Demar Derozan**, **CJ McCollum**, and **Russell Westbrook** join the club of having done 3 seasons passing the criteria. Based on this, getting tickets to Blazers games when they visit your city is going to give you the best bang for your buck because it is extremely probable that both Dame and CJ (or at the very least one of them) will be suiting up.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,69814,public,self,[OC] Load Management and You: How to get the Best Value when you are buying tickets to an NBA game,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/dsq291/oc_load_management_and_you_how_to_get_the_best/,,,,,,,,,,,1573176029.0,,,,,

Which star/superstar is the most guaranteed to put on a show, and more importantly, least likely to be load managed/injured?

Obviously, one of the first players that came to mind was Karl-Anthony Towns. It seems like unless he gets hit by a car or choked out by Embiid, he's going to show up and he's going to get buckets.

To do a more quantitative and comprehensive approach, I came up with the following criteria. I wanted to look for players under age 30 (younger players get load managed less) who had the most seasons with at least [75 GS (~90% of the season), 30 MPG, 20 PPG, 0.5486 TS%]. I searched only the past 4 seasons (since 2015-16) to ensure that the results were recent enough to serve as a basis for forecasting. The 0.5486 TS% was the league average across the previous 4 seasons.

I chose those particular criteria because I believe most casual fans would probably like to see a guy who can score the basketball, do it relatively efficiently, play most of the game, and have at least a 90% probability of actually playing. Whether or not you believe these stats correlate perfectly with winning basketball, they do represent a player that can do those 4 things.

Using these qualifiers, I did a simple query of Basketball Reference's Total Season Finder. Here are the results:

For the lazy, Kemba Walker and Paul George have done this all 4 of the past 4 seasons. Bradley Beal, Damian Lillard, Klay Thompson, James Harden, and Karl Anthony-Towns have done it thrice in the past 4 seasons. Look for when these players are coming to town if you want to avoid being disappointed by load management.

FINAL NOTE: If you remove the TS% qualifier, Demar Derozan, CJ McCollum, and Russell Westbrook join the club of having done 3 seasons passing the criteria. Based on this, getting tickets to Blazers games when they visit your city is going to give you the best bang for your buck because it is extremely probable that both Dame and CJ (or at the very least one of them) will be suiting up.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,69814,public,self,0 [OC] Load Management and You: How to get the Best Value when you are buying tickets to an NBA game.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/dsq1rw/0_oc_load_management_and_you_how_to_get_the_best/,,,,,,,,,,,1573176017.0,,,,,

So curry is shooting around 4% less with far less assists, but turns the ball over more while scoring less. To put this in perspective: This is around a 4-5% drop-off in efficiency. His impact stats fall off a cliff as well.

KD's years are from 2009/2010- 2015/2016

Reg: 38.7/62%/19.5/12.5

I agree with him on the fact that his teammates are looking to him as much on the offensive end and I think that should change. The Jazz have a few good scorers like Mitchell, Bogdanovic, and even though he’s not playing the same he‬ has in the past, Mike Conley. 

The exact quote is:

“When you have a gut that’s 7-foot-2 who can catch the ball and finish under the rim, you have to use it. We haven’t done it the last two years against the Rockets and we’re not doing it right now, so I’m hoping we can work on it. “

He would continue and say:

“Usually, I feel like we can lob it up. But once the lob isn’t there, we’re not really looking. It’s on me to get in good positions at the rim, and at the same time, it’s in my teammates to want to find me.”

The Jazz have been known to struggle against the Houston Rockets. Since the Rockets tend to switch on everything on the defensive end, Rudy Gobert tends to find himself being defended by a guard behind the three point arc, unable to do anything but pass. If the Jazz decide to aim towards setting up Gobert in the paint once a guard like Conley, Mitchell, Exum, or Mudiay, he’ll be more equipped to help and get a dunk or layup. As I mentioned before, Gobert is a top 5 center in my opinion behind Embiid, Jokic, Towns, and Drummond. When the Jazz play the Rockets, he’s typically guarded by Clint Capela. It’s a good matchup for both guys but I feel like Gobert has the edge there. Once the switch happens down low, there is no doubt in my mind that Gobert will be in great position to score.

The Western Conference has always been loaded with stars and the Jazz and Rockets are viewed as playoff teams by not only me but a bunch of fans and analysts as well. This being said, Houston vs. Utah is a very possible matchup in the playoffs. I strongly believe the Jazz should try and implement this offensive strategy whenever they find themselves match up against the Rockets. I also feel like it’s a good idea for them to use this style of play against other teams as well. The San Antonio Spurs and Los Angeles Clippers come to mind personally.

I’m very curious to hear what you all think the Jazz should look for Gobert more or continue to use a more perimeter play style on offense through Mitchell, Bogdanovic, Ingles, and Conley?

Because of this I have limited knowledge and was hoping to get some better insight.

For whatever reason I've decided that I like Javale McGee and think that's he's a pretty awesome player. 

I've been noticing more and more than people are claiming how much better of a player Howard is and that he should be taking more time from McGee. Is this true? Could there be reasons for his better stats? Maybe because McGee is a starter going against other starters would surely sway the numbers when Howard is coming in later vs other players?

Harden’s usage rate is 40.5% while he is playing (35 minutes per game), or 29.5% for the entire Rockets game for 48 minutes (when factoring in Harden’s time off the court).

Factoring in his team usage rate into average NBA team’s free throw attempts (22.8), Harden should be averaging 6.7 free throws per 48 minutes — roughly 5.0 free throws in his 35 minutes per game.

However, Harden is averaging 15.8 free throws in his 35 minutes per game, which averages out to 21.1 free throws per 48 minutes. This is extremely close to the average NBA team’s 22.8 attempts per game.

Now it gets crazier -- Harden’s free throws come at his team usage rate of 29.5%. If Harden was his own team and had a 100% usage rate, he would average a whopping 71.5 free throws per game, 314% more attempts than the average NBA team.

I know I blew the free throw attempts out of proportion with the per 48 minute average, but this is just absolute insanity to me. Does the NBA need to do something about the referees' seemingly favorable treatment of Harden? Is Harden just THAT good at drawing fouls?

He'll be the only player in history who'll break Kareem's record (most points scored in NBA history). It's impossible to break it now unless you skip college and go straight to NBA from high school (which isn't possible) and play like a star right from the start. LeBron is literally our last chance at ever seeing someone take that title from Kareem. It's insane to think about it. KD was our other hope, but I think with the Achilles that ship has sadly sailed. LeBron is still averaging 27 points a game and even if his stats do drop, he should comfortably beat the record as he said that he wants to play an NBA match with his son, which means he's here to stay. 
2. He'll be the only player in NBA history with the ultimate triple double: 40k career points, 10k assists, 10k rebounds. Let that sink in for a second. 
3. LeBron will 100% win at least one ring with AD. If they win this season, they're winning it again next season because they'll get even better and he'll recruit stronger players. So he's gonna retire with 4 rings minimum, maybe 5 or even 6 (I don't see 6 happening, but who knows).

This problem was even more amplified when the Heat blew out the Rockets on Sunday by almost 30 points.

Defense is crucial for success in the NBA.  Besides the 2001 Lakers ( who battled injuries during the regular season, Shaq missed a lot of games) not a single championship team has won a title without being at least top 10 in defense efficiency.

Which players do you feel are in a sense, 'hidden gems', players that are yet to find a home on an NBA team but would be decent or good rotation role players?

For me, the first player that comes to mind and one I was surprised to see unsigned is Justin Anderson. I felt he was a productive role player in Philadelphia and though he had a rough stint in Atlanta, I feel he could be a good signing to plug any holes a team may have in their small forward rotation. Golden State specifically could benefit from him as their Forward spot is at best fringe NBA level and at worst G League level.

Omri Casspi is another player who I was surprised to see outside the NBA, as I feel he can be valuable to a team looking to contend. A natural SF, though I prefer him at the Stretch 4, Casspi would especially be a good signing for my Blazers as they are currently painfully hamstrung at the PF spot due to injuries to crucial pieces. Though his shooting regressed in Memphis, I still believe he could shoot a solid 50% from the field and 37% from 3 for a team with good spacing looking to contend for a deep playoff run.

Unfortunately Darren Collison has retired but if any team was able to lure him back into the NBA I think he'd still be one of the premier role player PGs in the league and indeed one of the most accurate shooters at the guard spot in the league. He would be a great piece either as a starter or a bench player, unfortunately it seems he is quite set on his retirement.

Needless to say, he'll probably accept it if he values money. Regardless, whether or not he does, I think there will be an interesting question the next time he reaches unrestricted free agency, namely what is he worth to a team?

In my non-expert opinion, I see him as someone who peaks as a championship 3rd option. However, he will be 32-ish years old the next time he is an FA. What happens then? What do you think the market looks like for him at that point?

As a biased fan, I'd love to see him join my team if we strike out on that Greek dude, perhaps on a lower pay scale as a 6th man playmaker like Iggy on the Warriors, which I think is a role he can easily play even at age 32-33. However, and this applies to wherever he goes after next season, his defense will probably only continue to get worse and that doesn't bode well for a midrange scorer on the perimeter.

I'm not saying that this couldn't change but this is sort of a first glance point of view.

  As positive I am divided between TWolves and the Suns but the latter of the two has been more of a surprise in my book. They have 4-2 score with both of the losses came by just 1 point in OT against the Nuggets and against Utah. Both of these teams are guaranteed PO teams and the Suns are playing without Ayton so that's why their score is most impressive for me. The Suns since Bledsoe's departure didn't have a real PG and not when they went and got a decent one in Rubio became better team just by playing organized basketball and not having to look for Booker to make something happen on every possession. Also they got some depth in the frontcourt by signing Baynes, Saric and Kaminsky. In the summer I wasn't even sure that Kaminsky will get another NBA contract but he's playing really well for the Suns, Baynes is again great energy guy willing to put his body on a line for the team, and on that contract he's a steal. Actually I was surprised that the Celtics didn't keep him. Saric is starting the season slowly but that has been the case for several years now and I think he'll become better as the season progresses. But I guess lot of it has to do with their new coach Monty Williams. At times they look really good defensively and on the offense the ball movement is excellent and they are second in assists while also not turning the ball over too many times. So out of that ball movement on many possessions they get a lot of open looks from deep and hit them in decent enough percentage even though except Booker nobody is considered to be a lethal sharpshooter. I guess team play and lot of energy got them here. With all that being said I still don't really see them as a PO contender but surely this is a step in the right direction and it's nice to see them back on track.

   On the negative side of things I don't want to go for GSW because they are too easy target and I skipped Brooklyn although their 2-4 score is looking awful and I'm not convinced that bringing Irving and Durant together with Jordan is best thing for their long term success, but I'd much rather talk about a team that came into the season with high expectations looking for PO appearance. Of course that team is Sacramento Kings. They had surprisingly good last season with Hield breaking out to become legit offensive threat to any defense out there and Fox taking a huge leap in production after decent rookie season, but this summer they made lot of strange FA moves. Giving really big contract to Barnes while they didn't look any better after trading for him in the first place last season and also really overpaying Cory Joseph for their back up PG and Dedmon at C. Also signing of Ariza doesn't make much sense when you look at their depth. Now they are in bad cap situation with Bogdan, Fox and Bagley waiting for their second contracts. But even more worrying sign is the way the team is being coached. Not a lot of movement is going on and a lot of iso play for Buddy who is better utilized as off ball threat as we've seen for entire. Of course he can get hot like in first half against Suns but that's not sustainable for 48 minutes. So also as total opposite to last season when they were one of the top three point shooting teams now they are near bottom. Most of that comes from the fact that now they play at much slower pace and this team simply isn't suited for that. For the rest of the season I expect it to start looking better but PO is out of the question and they really need to start making some decisions for the future.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,69525,public,self,Which team for you has been biggest positive and negative surprise in the first two weeks of this season?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/dr6yir/which_team_for_you_has_been_biggest_positive_and/,,,,,,,,,,,1572902523.0,,,,,

This offseason, however, saw many max or near max-contracts signed to players that many deemed to be overpayments, is includes but its not limited to the contracts signed by Pascal Siakam, Jamal Murray, Jaylen Brown, Al Horford, Khris Middleton, Tobias Harris, De'Angelo Russell, Kristaps Porzingis, and Nikola Vučević. Some questions were even understandably raised towards the contracts signed by extablished multi time all stars, like Jimmy Butler and Kevin Durant. 

Another dimension to this is the ""supermax contract"" that the nba introduced presumably to reduce player movement. Many players to receive this contract have some raising questions about if that player is worth their percent on the cap hit, and we are already seeing some becoming very questionable (John Wall) Much like a max contract, there is a sentiment that teams feel obligated or forced to give their franchise player the max contract or risk losing them. But with the increased emphasis on player agency and player control, agents seem to be demanding these max, supermax, or near max contracts at an ever increasing rate?

The way I see it, what happened this offseason may lead to drastic reconsideration in the future about when a max contract is appropriate. While every team is hoping that the questions concerning their max player do not become an issue, the reality is that many of them will indeed become ""albatross contracts."" 

My question to you is, and especially to people well versed in sports economics, is there a max-contract bubble that will eventually burst and lead to a drastic reduction in the rate that max contracts are given in the future? Or is the increased emphasis around the league about player agency, and the future projections of the nba salary cap going to offset the ""bubble bursting""?

But we all know how flawed the eye test can be and a lot of the nuances of basketball other than scoring, such as playmaking and defense, can be heavily underrated due to the eye test.

Taking a quick glance at some advanced analytics from Shaq's peak regular season(most agree it's his MVP season), Lebron's peak regular season (it's heavily debated which season this is but I consider it 08-09), and MJ's peak regular season (I picked 87-88)

Shaq:

* 40 MPG
* .578 TS%
* 18.6 WS
* .283 WS/48
* 6.2 OBPM
* 3.5 DBPM
* 9.3 VORP
*

Lebron

* 37.7 MPG
* .591 TS%
* 20.3 WS
* .318 WS/48
* 9.4 OBPM
* 3.6 DBPM
* 11.6 VORP

MJ

* 40.4 MPG
* .603 TS%
* 21.2 WS
* .308 WS/48
* 9.8 OBPM
* 2.3 DBPM
* 11.8 VORP

Unfortunately, I could not find PIPM or RPM for old seasons so we can't really compare them using some of our best advanced metrics. If someone could derive or find them somehow I would appreciate it 

But a quick analysis at the advanced rate and count, we can see that Shaq isn't significantly better than ethier Lebron or Jordan in all of these metrics. In fact, Shaq seems to lag behind a little in most metrics. Although these metrics are flawed.

All in all, I don't see any empirical evidence that supports the claim that Shaq was the most dominant player in nba history.

I was just thinking about this and so many players have such unique styles of play that make them stand out so I was wondering which two were the closest.

 [So HERE are the stats for contested 3s (0-2 feet)](https://stats.nba.com/teams/shots-closest-defender/?Season=2018-19&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;sort=FG3A&amp;dir=1)
Added them up and found that the playoff teams took a total of 9.1 threes from this range and made 2.4 of them. 2.4/9.1 gives us 26.37%, 

and then to get the 2 point value: 26.37*1.5 gives us 39.56%. 

[And HERE are the stats for contested 3s (2-4 feet)](https://stats.nba.com/teams/shots-closest-defender/?Season=2018-19&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;CloseDefDistRange=2-4%20Feet%20-%20Tight&amp;sort=FG3A&amp;dir=1) 
Added them up and found that the playoff teams took a total of 73 (exact!) threes from this range and made 21.5 of them. 21.5/73 gives us 29.45%, 

and then to get the 2 point value: 29.45*1.5 gives us 44.18%.

Added up together NBA playoff teams shot 23.9/82.1 which gives us a make percentage of 29.11%,

and then to get the 2 point value: 29.11*1.5 gives us 43.67%

**So 43.67% is the field goal percentage number a player needs to hit from mid range for it to be more efficient.**





Now onto the mid range stats:

In contrast, DeMar joined one of the best organizations of all time, coached by one of the best coaches of all time, and yet again posted the lowest plus-minus out of anyone on his new team.

&amp;nbsp;

Plus-minus doesn't tell the whole story, but it's difficult to dismiss 6 years worth of data. And his plus-minus isn't just ""bad""--it's all-time bad. He consistently finishes in the bottom 5-10% of all eligible playoff players. It has to be exceptionally rare for a playoff team to consistently perform better without one of its stars, let alone without their supposed best player(which he was regarded as with the Raptors). And it's difficult to fault his teammates when he alone consistently ranks near the bottom of the league every postseason.   I added Kyle Lowry's plus-minus totals for comparison,

Lakers in 2009 along the way. He was a superstar with Orlando, his first stint with the Lakers in 2012-13 and three seasons with Houston from 2013-14 to 2015-16 where he was mostly phased out as a star player in favor of James Harden.

And when Dwight became a free agent and immediately capitalized on the 2016 Free Agent Bonanza where he luckily scored himself a three year $70.5M contract with his hometown Atlanta Hawks. Atlanta probably gave him that amount of money since they thought D12 could still be salvaged as a star despite being phased out of a changing NBA.

In 74 regular season games played as the starting center for the Hawks, Dwight averaged a decent 13.5 points, 12.7 rebounds and 1.2 blocks in 29-30 minutes per game to go with a field goal percentage of .633% on making 5.2 field goals of 8.3 field goal attempts per game. His backup at C was another veteran in Kris Humphries.

By the time the 2017 NBA Playoffs rolled around, the Hawks were matched up against the Washington Wizards in the first roind in a six game series. Dwight Howard matched up against Wizards’ starting center Marcin Gortat. Unfortunately, Dwight ended up averaging 8 points and 10.7 rebounds in 26 minutes per game as either Gortat got the better of him, or both Atlanta and Washington mostly went for smaller lineups with Atlanta running a team of Dennis Schroder, Tim Hardaway, Jr., Kent Bazemore (off the bench), Taurean Prince and Paul Millsap, and so the Wizards eliminated the Hawks from the 2017 playoffs to end the first round series matchup.

After this, Dwight would never again make the playoffs despite being the starting center for the Charlotte Hornets and the Washington Wizards (where he was out for 73 games due to a butt injury, and so Thomas Bryant filled in for him), and even if Dwight makes the playoffs again in a Lakers uniform, there’s no guarantee that Dwight would start anymore and he’d most likely play very little unless former New Orleans Pelicans superstar Anthony Davis and LeBron James are sidelined to injury and/or the Lakers lose confidence in JaVale McGee as a full time starter at C.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,69340,public,self,Dwight Howard’s last playoff run in 2017 as a starting C in the NBA for his hometown Atlanta Hawks.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/dpzvcp/dwight_howards_last_playoff_run_in_2017_as_a/,,,,,,,,,,,1572671496.0,,,,,

With Zion and Jrue out he looks like a true allstar and a potential all NBA player.  The Pelicans have the money to pay him what he wants and from everything we've heard out of New Orleans he seems to be happy.   I dont think BI will make it to the offseason without a new max but is New Orleans willing to pay it?


While unlikely, there are a few possible timelines where Brandon Ingram doesn't stay in New Orleans.   The most realistic scenario where BI gets moved is.... 

Zion and Jrue return moving BI to the 3rd scoring option.  With the ball out of BIs hands he becomes under utilized.  His scoring drops and his game transitions to more off the ball shooter even though he thrives creating his own shot.   With the 2020 FA market barren Ingrams value for a sign and trade skyrockets.   David Griffin might not want to pay theax for a 3rd option so he flips him for an asset that fits around Zion and Jru.  Here are a few teams that I think we be a great fit for a trade.  


-  Pacers
Pacers desperately need a wing scorer to compliment Dipo.  The Pelicans need a center to fit around Zion and Myles Turner seems perfect.  Turner is able to stretch the floor like Jaxon cant (for now) and is  able to gaurd bigs Zion cant.  His contract also allows the Pels to sign Lonzo in the offseason.  The trade would be.

Pacers get BI on a max sign and trade.
Pelicans get Myles Turner and a protected 1st.


-  Hawks
The Hawks have the most cap space in league this summer with very little options to spend it on. Hawks are in need of an on the ball scoring wing that can relieve pressure from Trae when he is being trapped at half court.  Kevin Huerter is splitting time with Cam Reddish and seems like a great fit NOLA.  Kevin is an excellent shooter that doesnt need to be on the ball to score.  With only one year in on his rookie contract he gives the Pelicans freedom to make moves this offseason.  The trade would be...

Hawks get BI on a Max sign and trade 
Pelicans get Huerter,  2020 Hawks 1st and 2020 Nets 1st.

The West is an absolute gauntlet full of strong teams, so it's difficult to see this Warriors team going very far this year. Bob Myers, a great drafting GM, may look to regroup this season to put the Dubs back into contention next year when Klay Thompson returns. Their best asset that they're willing to move is D'Angelo Russell, a 23 year-old all star who's eligible to be traded in mid-December.

The Timberwolves, on the opposite end of the spectrum, are stuck in the purgatory that is mediocrity in the NBA. They have one of the best big men in the league in Karl-Anthony Towns who has not gotten much help after the departure of Jimmy Butler. Fortunately, he's only 23. Lots of people would attribute their lack of success to former #1 pick Andrew Wiggins, whose contract is often discussed as one of the worst in the NBA. Wiggins is not a complete bum in the NBA, despite what r/nba might tell you; he's an average shooter with questionable shot selection and a slightly below average defender. He's a reasonable wing starter on a lot of teams (including the Wolves), but because of his contract he is a huge negative for a franchise. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm sure you can all see where this is going by now, but without further ado, here is the trade:

**Warriors receive**: Andrew Wiggins, Robert Covington, 2021 first round pick, 2023 first round pick

**Timberwolves receive**: D'Angelo Russell

Because of the Andrew Iguodala trade exception, this trade does work salary wise.

&amp;nbsp;

**Why the Warriors say yes**: this trade puts the Warriors deep into the tax, but the owners haven't shown reluctance to pay up for title contending teams. The Warriors right now are absolutely devoid of depth. After Steph, D'Lo, and Draymond, there is a big talent gap to Kevon Looney, and then another big gap to the rest of the team. The have a lot of young guys with potential, but they're still trying to win ASAP. You don't take multiple years to develop young talent when the Splash Brothers are on your team. Adding Wiggins and Covington gives them great depth on the wings. Covington is awesome for the Warriors; a no-strings-attached 3 and D guy who shot the 3 at a 38% clip the last 2 seasons. Playing alonagside Steph and Klay, he could easily be one of the highest percentage shooters in the league next year. With Klay, Covington, and Draymond, they're switchability on defense is scary good, and they'll be great at hiding Curry. Wiggins will not take 17 shots a game on the Warriors. Lots of people say that he has an effort/mindset problem, and I would not be surprised to see that change on the dynamic Warriors team. Golden State takes it easy this year, probably picks in the lottery if Steph misses considerable time, makes 2 more first round picks, and gears up for next season. The Wiggins contract hurts, but he can be valuable for a couple years while they still contend. When it expires, Steph is getting old and they may look to rebuild with their strong draft assets.

**Why the Timberwolves say yes**: Wiggins has hamstrung this franchise and the Wolves will jump at offers that let them dump him off. And they get D'Lo, one of the better assets in the league. Win-win. They get to build around two 23 year old all-star caliber players, who also happen to be good friends off the court, in KAT and D'Lo. This move gives the team a clear path towards becoming a championship contender down the road. Losing first round picks always hurts, but they do have strong young talent on their roster already with the likes of Josh Okogie and Jarrett Culver. 2 years from now, when they are no longer paying Jeff Teague and Gorgui Dieng, their 2 stars will be entering their prime, Okogie and and Culver will still be on their rookie deals, and they will have lots of room to sign another top talent in what will be a very strong free agency class. 

&amp;nbsp;

What do you guys think of this trade? I think it's a win for both teams, although the Timberwolves probably profit more. Should they have to trade more picks? Fewer picks? I think the Warriors move D'Lo, and I wouldn't be surprised to see the Wolves try to do something with Wiggins.

This past summer, the New Orleans had as good of an offseason as you can expect for a team that had to trade away (arguably) the best player in franchise history smack dab in the middle of his prime. 

The reasons for optimism were multi-faceted. Obviously, the draft gods smiled upon them and granted them Duke PF Zion Williamson, one of the better and more marketable prospects of the century. More than that, the team secured two respected executives for their front office in David Griffin and GM Trajan Langdon. Immediately, they proved their cool head and competency. The new front office was largely hailed for the return on their Anthony Davis trade, using AD to land a load of assets, and parlaying those assets into even more. 

By the time the dust and beignet sugar settled, the Pelicans looked absolutely stacked with young talent, and also stacked to the brim with depth. Depth on top of depth. In fact, it's fair to suggest that the Pelicans have 12+ players who should be playing in a rotation somewhere around the league.

In some ways, the new-look Pelicans felt like TWO separate teams smushed together. You had a group of young talent (led by Zion Williamson and the old Lakers core) that would still have some growing pains but a high ceiling, and you had the veteran core that could theoretically compete for a playoff spot now (led by Jrue Holiday and new additions J.J. Redick and Derrick Favors.) 

For the sake of illustration, here would be those ""two"" rosters:

######**team win now (or at least, ""go .500 now"")**

PG: Jrue Holiday (29 years old)

SG: J.J. Redick (35), E'Twaun Moore (30)

SF: Darius Miller (29) *injured*

PF: Nicolo Melli (28)

C: Derrick Favors (28)

######**team win later**

PG: Lonzo Ball (22 years old), Frank Jackson (21)

SG: Nickeil Alexander-Walker (21)

SF: Brandon Ingram (22)

PF: Zion Williamson (19)

C: Jaxson Hayes (19)

**floaters** (who can fit either team): Josh Hart (24 years old), Kenrich Williams (24), Jahlil Okafor (23)

Perhaps my estimate that this team had 12+ capable rotation players may have been under-selling them; that's 14 players who could be getting minutes on a team somewhere and would have been 15 if Miller had been healthy this year. 

Because of that insane depth (and because of Zion Williamson), the Pelicans had been regarded as a darkhorse pick to make the playoffs. The top 8 in the Western Conference may have been tough to crack, but their over/under of 39.5 wins suggested that they had a puncher's chance. Who knows; maybe Zion Williamson could come into the league with Blake Griffin type impact (22-12-4 as a rookie) and fuel that spark. 

---

**part two: A BUBBLING MESS**

Unfortunately, things have not gone according to plan. Zion Williamson got injured, and is expected to miss a month or two of the season (and may be held out longer.)

In his absence, the team looks disjointed and confused. There's some ""good"" (like Brandon Ingram's scoring), but plenty bad. Coach Alvin Gentry hasn't settled on a rotation yet, and can't figure out the right concoction and recipe for success. The team has started 0-4, and has struggled mightily on the defensive end. They've given up 120+ points in every game, and rank 29th (among 30 teams) in defensive rating.

Any team with a bunch of new pieces is bound to have some growing pains, but there's not much room for error in the stacked Western Conference. 45+ wins is a good bar to shoot for to make the playoffs, and that's starting to look out of reach. If the team can't get their defense straightened out, 30-35 wins may be a more reasonable expectation for this season.

And if that's the case... what then? Do you simply shrug and push your timeline back a year or two? That would make sense in theory, but there's some degree of a ""ticking clock"" here. Brandon Ingram will be a restricted free agent this summer, and will be a handsomely paid one if he continues his hot start. His current rates (27.3 PPG, 9.5 REB, 4.8 AST) aren't sustainable, but he could realistically hit 23-7-5 in a fast-paced offense like this. And if he does, he may be near ""max"" range.

While the pace and space system of Alvin Gentry fits with the talent in either timeline, coach Gentry may be worried about time himself. He's 64 years old, and entering his 5th year with the team. As likable as Gentry may be, it's not easy for coaches to survive prolonged losing stretches. So far, he's finished 30-52, 34-48, 48-34, and 33-49. If he can't win 35 games this season, that'd be the 4th time out of 5. If David Griffin wanted to find ""his own"" coach, he'd have every excuse to make that move. He can look outside the organization or within, as top assistant Chris Finch is among the top rising stars in the league given his offensive acumen. 

Going forward, you have to wonder if there's going to be a push and pull between these forces. Griffin and the front office (in their first year) should have plenty of leash and plenty of patience, but Gentry and the coaching staff may feel some pressure to ""win/compete now."" As the Pelicans figure out and formalize their rotation, those big picture decisions will become more critical.

---

**part three: SELLING OUR STEW AT THE CRESCENT CITY FARMERS MARKET**

0-4 is a disappointment, but it's less than 5% of a regular season. There's a decent chance that the team rattles off some wins and gets back into a respectful range. It's way too early to panic or make serious decisions about their future.

But what if 0-4 turns into 3-10? Or 10-20? How long before we write off this season? How long before we hit the ""panic"" button?

Of course, ""panic"" is a relative term. Even if they're 10-20, the Pelicans still don't *have* to do anything. They don't have cap problems (right now), and they still have a bright future. There's plenty of excitement about this young core. Hell, even if Zion Williamson misses this entire season, ESPN will still be hyping up his debut next year as a headline story. The Pelicans can take their lumps right now, and utilize their veterans as mentors along the way.

That said, they have the opportunity to shift gears, pivot, and perhaps turn some of those veterans into trade chips instead. Let's take a look at how that may work, from a practical perspective.

The first shoe to drop would be **SG E'Twaun Moore**. In fact, that shoe may already be on the floor. At the moment, Moore's not even in the rotation (although injury recover may explain some of that.) But when healthy and fit, Moore's an underrated player and fills the template of a 3+D wing. In fact, he's hit 42.5% and 43.2% of his threes the past two seasons. He's only 6'4"", but he utilizes his wingspan (6'9"") to be a positive defender. Know any teams that could use a solid 3+D SG? Yeah. Basically *every* team.

Better yet, Moore would be a simple and cheap acquisition. He's on the last year of a reasonable deal ($8.7M). Would the Pelicans miss him? Not terribly. At the moment, SG is one of the Pelicans' lowest priority needs. They have Jrue Holiday and Lonzo Ball playing both PG/SG, as well as J.J. Redick, Josh Hart, and Nickeil Alexander-Walker. Moore would be more valuable to another team than their own. In terms of a ""trade return,"" you can't expect the world, but you can expect a positive asset. A team like the Milwaukee Bucks is always on the lookout for 3+D wings, and Moore would fit that roster nicely. And if the Pelicans don't intend to bring Moore back next season, it's a move that they simply must consider. 

In fact, the Pelicans don't just have one veteran shooting guard to spare; they may have *two*. To that end, they should consider trading **SG J.J. Redick** when eligible. Redick is a good guy and a good mentor, but he's over-qualified for that role. He can still contribute to a winning team. Two seasons ago, Redick set a career high with 17.1 points per game (at age 33.) The next year, he set a *new* career high with 18.1 points per game (at age 34.) That Dorian Gray run will probably end this year (he's had an underwhelming start with 25.5 minutes and 9.5 points per game), but he can still serve as a complementary scorer and spacer.

Logistically speaking, a J.J. Redick trade isn't far-fetched either. Redick is due $13.5M this season, and $13.0M the next. It sounds a little pricy for a 35-36 year old, but he should still be able to contribute 25 minutes a night to a good team. And while a 1:1 swap gets tricky in this price range, a team like the L.A. Lakers could find a way to cobble together matching salaries. For example, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope ($8.1M), Quinn Cook ($3M), and Troy Daniels ($2.0M) would hit our mark. The Pelicans have no reason to simply hand Redick off to a contender out of the kindness of their hearts, so they'd like at least a *little* asset back for their services. Dealing a heavily protected R1 pick isn't absurd to ask for when you're dealing with teams that have their eye on the 2021 title. Presumably, Redick would be more than willing to accommodate a trade himself. Not only does he have a playoff streak to consider, but he's nearing the end of the road and running out of chances to chase a title.

In terms of other potential assets, the Pelicans have a few, but may not be as willing to deal them. A trade for **PF/C Derrick Favors** doesn't look likely at this point. While Favors can contribute to a winning team, the Pelicans are thinner in the frontcourt than the backcourt right now. With Williamson injured and Jaxson Hayes still so raw, Favors is a nice fill-in safety net down low. Over-extending either Williamson or Hayes (and risking their health) wouldn't be a prudent move. Similarly, a trade for **SF Darius Miller** (a decent stretch wing) is nullified by his own injury. And of course, the Pelicans wouldn't trade any of their young talent because that should remain their top priority. Among the roster, Moore (and maybe Redick) appear the most likely candidates.

---

**part four: POTENTIAL VOODOO CURSE**

As mentioned, if the current Pelicans continue to struggle this season, it's not a big deal. If they sell off some veterans, it's not a big deal. The playoffs in 2020 were always going to be less of a focus than the playoffs in 2021, and 2022, and 2023 and beyond.

But from a big picture perspective, a bad start *next* season would be scarier than [Baron Samedi](https://jamesbond.fandom.com/wiki/Baron_Samedi). If the Pelicans stumble to a bad start in 2020-21 and still don't look ready to contend for the playoffs, then you have to start to wonder about kicking the can even further down the road and potentially considering a trade with **PG Jrue Holiday**. 

On face value, that sounds insane. Holiday is one of the faces of the franchise, and coming off one of his best stretches in his career. But naturally, when a player is in his prime like this (age 29), he won't be this good forever. And at the end of the day, the Pelicans are going to have to ask themselves: will there be enough of an overlap between Holiday's best years, and the primes of our young stars like Ingram and Zion Williamson? If not, they may have to fully embrace the youth movement and pencil in a year like 2023 as their target to contention.

What's so nice about being David Griffin and the Pelicans right now is that even *that* nightmare scenario doesn't sound so bad. When you have a foundational piece like Zion Williamson, then you can afford to wait and wait and load up some youtube highlights whenever you get cold and lonely after a loss at night. To that end, the REAL nightmare scenario for this franchise would be whether Williamson's health injuries persist, and if you start to doubt whether his body is made for an 80-game NBA grind.

Now, I believe that against the very best teams, especially in the playoffs in this era, small PG’s that are your primary option is not the best way to go. They tend to get swallowed up by length.

Obviously Curry is an exception. He’s the best shooter to play the game, and he played with other top tier players which require just as much attention. 

Players like Kawhi, Giannis, Simmons, Doncic all have more than the average length/height at there position and all though they are incredibly skilful, their physical attributes help them to stand out when it’s most important.

With Caris LeVert, the Brooklyn Nets also provide an up and coming player who could make his breakout in the 19/20 season.  The 6-7 Wing should also get some gameplay thanks to the regrettable failure of Durant and play a central role in the team's playoff ambitions.  Although LeVert is already relatively old at the age of 25 for a classic breakout candidate, he could make the leap to (borderline) star in his fourth season.  In the last season, he has shown very promising approaches especially after his serious injury that left him half the season and was presumably the best player of the team with 21 points per game in the playoffs when leaving the first round, as well as 4 assists at a 118er ORtg.  These captivating impressions are now to be confirmed and it is hoped that the Nets will be able to turn his talent into constant performances night after night in the 19/20 season.

 His abilities are undoubtedly present, especially in the offense, even if he was not yet able to act over an entire season above-average efficiency.  His ORTg from the first three seasons is on average at 104 and is thus still clearly removed from a positive impact for their own team.  So far, LeVert has achieved an explosive start and dynamic dribbling and is already a very strong finisher on the basket with 63.5% FG over his career.  In addition, he lets flash on his drives to the basket, again and again, a good understanding of the game and finds with kick-out passes the open teammates.  If he manages to make the right decision more often in the coming season, his creation will be even more efficient for himself and others.  His throw was still expandable and could be the sticking point for his candidacy as a breakout player.  So far, LeVert has not been able to meet his threesomes over a season well above average.  In the playoffs last year he ran hot with over 45%, however, the sample size of 26 attempts is still too low to be able to draw reliable conclusions.  The offensive quality of its players has risen compared to the previous year and it remains to be seen what advantages and synergies will result from these changes.

 Defensively, LeVert also has very good facilities and, thanks to his good length and excellent athletic ability, can be a problem for his matchups.  LeVert is in a position to iron out the mistakes of his teammates through good footwork and fast reactivity and makes a solid figure on the ball as well as in a team.  He can read passing lanes and put pressure on the opponent, which gives him a respectable amount of ball wins.  However, he occasionally misses the constancy at the defensive end and makes moments of inattention.  He occasionally relies too much on his athletic ability and defends badly or not until the end of the shot-clock.  Nevertheless, he was part of a solid defense last year and can be a full-back of his powers a plus defender for the team.

 Above all, LeVert has flashed in his career hitherto approaches that arouse hopes for a player with a positive impact on both sides of the field.  Offensively, he should be able to draw on the full after sufficient time of recovery and further increase his performance in a larger role.

No college scout, assesses a players talent by the number of titles his team has won.   Look throughout the history of number one overall picks in the NBA.  Almost none of them won collegiate championships before entering the NBA.

More importantly, is that most players can only play 35-38 minutes per game.  48 minutes (NBA game length) times 5 (number of players on the court) is 240 total minutes.  Obviously, the other 4 guys on the court (rest of the team) are going to have a massive impact on whether PLAYER X wins games.

&gt; The Warriors did lose Klay and that hurts them but they also got Dlo as a consolation player and while he isn't as good of a shooter as Klay he is more versatile with his play-making. They still have Draymond and Looney (injured now) and got WCS for their center position.

         That being said, imo J. Green or M. Harkless would be the more obvious choice to start, especially next to Zubac who they’d be able to cover for (he’s slow-footed, similar to PatPat) better than PatPat with their length and on-ball pressure, possibly funneling players or bruisers into Zu so he can defend the rim without having to chase people around. 
           I’m interested in what you guys think about the possibility of PatPat getting these starter minutes in order to bolster his trade value and eventually make possible a package of him and another player(s) for a big who’s a good screener and at least just another big body to throw around out there to back up Zu (Baynes would be the obvious player coming to mind but i don’t want even want to think about how we could make that trade w out giving up a lot, but the player mold is what i’m referring to here).

              I obviously have no way of confidently proving that this is what’s going on other than what i’ve already stated, but I was interested in seeing what you guys might think about this as a possibility or something to keep an eye on in the future.

 The raptors posted the second greatest playoff defense ever, but this has been called misleading based on the bucks series being an outlier where they took them to -10, and the raps suppsoedly being able to do this against orlando, philly, or the warriors. Here's the thing, this take is treating philly's offense before the midseason trade as the same as their offense after their trade. Also, the orlando series number is just straight wrong. Here's how the raps actually fared vs their first three opponents, two of whom were top 5 offenses with the rosters they took into the playoffs:  


Magic had an offensive rating of 109 in the rs. Their rating vs the raptors, 95.1. That gives us  


\-14  


Philly post their trade had an offensive rating of 115.2. Their rating vs the raptors? 105. That gives us  


\-10  


Additionally they took the bucks down by 10 points.  


So, up until the final, facing two top 5 offenses, the raps d went  


\-14,-10, and -10.  


Not only s the raps -9 not overrating them, it potentially underrates them.  


The real outlier here?  


The warriors who without kd, without cousins, and a large portion of the series without klay posted an offensive rating of 110 with klay and 107 without. Their offense was reduced by 6 points from the rs, and 5 points relative to their performance vs the blazers.

This past season, Pascal Siakam emerged as the champion Raptors' second-best player at times, while being paid in the 12th percentile of all NBA players. Stephen Curry's ankle issues led him to be famously underpaid during his MVP seasons and set the stage for his Warriors' mid-2010s dominance. You could make a convincing argument that LeBron James has been worth far more than his max contract for his on-court contributions alone.

&amp;nbsp;

On the flip side, bloated contracts given to underperforming stars or even middling role players can severely restrict the flexibility and ultimately the success of their teams. All Wolves' owner Glen Taylor needed to see from Andrew Wiggins before handing him a max contract was a handful of subpar chucking seasons and an (unfulfilled) [promise that he would improve](https://sports.yahoo.com/timberwolves-just-want-andrew-wiggins-promise-hell-get-better-200047839.html). Wiggins' ill-advised contract contributed to the downfall of the Wolves' short-lived return to relevance in 2018, and may eventually cost them the opportunity to retain Karl-Anthony Towns.

&amp;nbsp;

I mean, this a pretty straightforward concept - acquire high-value players and avoid having overpaid players on the roster. But is there anything more to this strategy that we can uncover? Are there certain types of players that tend to exist under the radar? What exactly constitutes a ""high-value"" player?

#Salary Scores and VORP Scores

My working definition of value is production in relation to salary. For two players with a given level of production, the player who is paid less than the other has more value. But how should we measure salary and production?

In order to form an effective basis for comparison across seasons, we need to scale salaries relative to each season. Otherwise a max contract from a decade ago would look like insane value compared to a similar size contract today. Case in point: Kobe Bryant in 2005 made $14.1 million. A similar salary today would net you players like Kelly Oubre, Marvin Williams, or Eric Gordon.

In addition to salary, we need a production metric. I chose VORP for the job given that it has a decent reputation as advanced metrics go and is widely available in Basketball Reference for the scope of this study. Because VORP is calculated to be era-independent, I scaled VORP relative to all seasons (2003-2019).

To compute both Salary Score and VORP Score, I rescaled the original variables such that the means have a value of 0 and the standard deviations have a value of 1.

I went as far back as 2003, when the NBA introduced the modern salary cap and luxury tax system that remains in place today. Before 2003 you had contracts exceeding the entire cap - but with different luxury tax incentives, teams and players behaved differently. 

&amp;nbsp;

So with these rescaled tools, we can plot all players from 2003-2019 on [one chart](https://i.imgur.com/75AvJmx.png).

&amp;nbsp;

We can begin to tease out an idea of value from this chart: remember that a positive Salary Score represents a salary above league average for that season, while a positive VORP Score represents a VORP above league average for the entirety of the 2003-2019 seasons. Thus, a player with a positive salary score and a negative VORP score can be identified as having poor value, and the opposite for a player with great value.

It gets a little murkier around the middle portion of the plot, where salary score and VORP score are similar. Just how valuable is a player that is paid highly yet falls slightly short in terms of production? How about a player that is paid slightly above average but produces well above average? There exists a delicate balance between the value of cap space and the rarity of big-time contributors - where exactly does the equilibrium fall?

A great many players are scrunched into that bottom left corner - that means they're below average in both salary and production. These players aren't difference makers on the court, nor on the team's books, so their value doesn't move the needle.

So we visually laid out players in a way that we can tease out some assumptions about value. But we need to more explicitly define this idea of *value*.

#Adding a Value Gradient

The tricky part in defining value is finding the balance in valuing production as magnitude of contract increases. The value of VORP does not progress at a one-to-one rate with salary - higher production players are increasingly rare and should be compensated accordingly. A player with a VORP of 5.0 should be worth more than two players each with a VORP of 2.5.

At the same time, cap space itself is highly valued, and a player taking up large amounts of cap room while not living up to their contract acts as a deadweight to a team that is now severely handicapped in building out the rest of the roster.

To come up with my Value Score, I created an expected salary for each player based on their VORP for that season. Then I subtracted the player's actual salary from their expected salary to get the first component of the Value Score. Then, in order to account for the rarity of higher production players, I added VORP Score as a second component to the Value Score. The end result, besides the ability to quantifiably rank player value, is [this value gradient](https://i.imgur.com/z5HnHXa.png).

&amp;nbsp;

The diagonal line represents the ""break-even curve"" where value score is calculated to be zero - players above and to the left are of below-average value, and players below and to the right of the curve are of above-average value.

The graph above confirms our intuitions about where the high and low value players reside, also giving us some clarity in the murky middle region of the graph.

Time to put it to use!

11 out of the 20 seasons are from budding young stars still on their rookie contracts. Andrei Kirilenko was an absolute beast in 2004, finishing second in VORP while earning a meager million. 

The non-rookie contract seasons come from: LeBron James - no further explanation needed; Steph Curry - whose aforementioned ankle issues suppressed his value until he blossomed into an all-time great; and a handful of superstars at the absolute peak of their game - 2003 McGrady, 2005 Garnett, and 2009 Wade.

The tail end of the value spectrum is populated almost exclusively by aging stars struggling with injury and ineffectiveness while still being paid handsomely  - 17 out of the 20 players listed here are in their 10th season or later. Derrick Rose's third comeback effort in as many seasons (after as many knee surgeries...) makes the cut. And then you have... Andrew Wiggins.

For a more recent flavor, let's take a look at the **most undervalued players from this past season (2019):**

|player|age|season number|team|sal|vorp|value score|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Karl-Anthony Towns|23|4|MIN|$7.8m|5.7|4.82|
|James Harden|29|10|HOU|$30.4m|9.9|4.72|
|Giannis Antetokounmpo|24|6|MIL|$24.2m|7.6|4.13|
|Nikola Jokic|23|4|DEN|$24.6m|7.3|3.83|
|Nikola Vucevic|28|8|ORL|$12.8m|5.3|3.7|
|Pascal Siakam|24|3|TOR|$1.5m|3.5|3.48|

|Luka Doncic|19|1|DAL|$6.6m|3.6|2.85|
|Rudy Gobert|26|6|UTA|$23.2m|5.9|2.75|
|Montrezl Harrell|25|4|LAC|$6.0m|3.4|2.73|


&amp;nbsp;

Again - 4 out of 10 players still on their rookie contracts. The rest? Giannis and Harden finished 1st and 2nd in MVP voting, respectfully; Vucevic had a career year on a very team-friendly salary; and Gobert's fourth-place finish in VORP lives up to his lofty salary, a scenario that Value Score (ahem) values highly.

Nikola Jokic, despite being in his fourth year, was not on his rookie deal due to the fact that he was a second-round pick. Second-rounders aren't subject to the same salary structure as first-rounders. He is still totally worth every dollar of that contract though.

&amp;nbsp;

**And now for underperformers in 2019:**

|player|age|season number|team|sal|vorp|value score|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Andrew Wiggins|23|5|MIN|$25.5m|-0.6|-4.12|
|Harrison Barnes|26|7|DAL/SAC|$24.1m|-0.2|-3.58|
|Gordon Hayward|28|8|BOS|$31.2m|1.2|-3.28|
|Jabari Parker|23|5|CHI/WAS|$20.0m|0.0|-2.79|
|Jeff Teague|30|10|MIN|$19.0m|-0.1|-2.73|
|Otto Porter|25|6|WAS/CHI|$26.0m|1.0|-2.71|
|Chris Paul|33|14|HOU|$35.7m|2.4|-2.69|
|Dennis Schroder|25|6|OKC|$15.5m|-0.6|-2.66|
|Allen Crabbe|26|6|BRK|$18.5m|-0.1|-2.65|
|Kent Bazemore|29|7|ATL|$18.1m|-0.1|-2.59|

&amp;nbsp;

Would you look at that - Wiggins takes the cake for most overvalued player of the 2018-19 season. And on the other end of the spectrum? His teammate, Karl-Anthony Towns.

There seems to be a trend we're noticing here, which leads us to...

#The Value of Rookie Contracts

The NBA introduced rookie scale contracts in 1995 in response to the growing number of absurdly large deals given to young, unproven rookies. The structure of these rookie contracts allows teams to retain their first-rounders for up to 4 seasons at a predetermined rate depending on their draft position.

Given the amount of uncertainty involved with projecting future success at such a young age, the structure makes a lot of sense. For the rookies, it represents guaranteed money upon being drafted, their first taste of (monetary) success. But for the standouts - those who enter the league as positive contributors, or become one after a season or two - this contract structure serves to artificially depress their salary, and thus lead to incredible value for their team. 

[Check out this visual](https://i.imgur.com/Tzz8gK8.png) which charts player salary against season number.

&amp;nbsp;

As the graphic above depicts, players in their first 4 seasons are vastly over-represented in the lower 50 percentile of salaries, which immediately shifts from season 5 on, when many rookie-scale contracts end. But does player production follow a similar progression?

&amp;nbsp;

[Not at all.](https://i.imgur.com/0ZjQuWg.png) By their third seasons, players' VORPs start to closely resemble those of more experienced players. This means that some of the most valuable contracts in the league, on a season-by-season basis, tend to be players in their third or fourth seasons. 


[This graphic](https://i.imgur.com/nvr2455.png) charts Salary Score by VORP Score, but separates players' seasons by season number.

&amp;nbsp;

[Here's all of them squashed into one graph](https://i.imgur.com/pEsDpIL.png) for a different look. Blue points represent players in their first four seasons, while red points denote players in their fifth seasons and on.

Note the solid value growth throughout the first four seasons, underscored by the dramatic shift from season four to season five.

As an aside: The goal here is not to uncover some hidden strategy - it's no secret that players who develop into positive contributors while still on their rookie-scale contracts get the most bang for their buck. Nevertheless, I think visualizing the scope of their value in comparison to more experienced players is pretty striking. 

#Bottom Line: Young Players Who Pan Out are Insanely Valuable.

...Until they sign their second contract, that is. Teams that hold the rights to the player hold a distinct advantage over others when it comes to retaining that player in terms of total salary and years offered. Valuing that contract, however, is especially tricky, as teams have to take into account future growth and injury risk, evaluate the player's fit and role within the team, and fight off other potential suitors. But before they sign that second contract...

&amp;nbsp;

Their value multiplies two-fold when you consider the cap flexibility retained by the team. Not only does the team reap the benefits of outsized productivity from a young, underpaid player, but they also maintain the wiggle room to acquire and keep additional talent.

&amp;nbsp;

If team like the Sixers manages to acquire a Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, two star-level players still on their rookie contracts, it leaves them with ample cap space to sign another star in Horford and put together a cast of high-level supporting players. The Sixers may face a troubling cap scenario when Embiid and Simmons' extensions both kick in, but for now they remain one of the favorites to come out of the East.

&amp;nbsp;

These results only magnify the importance of identifying and acquiring young talent. If a team can create a competitive advantage through the draft and hit on more draft picks than average, they can reap the benefits of their inflated value. Easier said than done, of course, but teams like the San Antonio Spurs have shown a consistent edge in finding talented young players later in the draft, which is a large component of their continued success.

#Next Steps

I ran into a few problems during the course of this project that need a little working around. Only players with over 800 minutes played on the season are included in the dataset, which leaves out some players on albatross contracts that sat out the entire season (Chandler Parsons comes to mind, also John Wall for this upcoming season) and the exclusion of which could skew the data.

&amp;nbsp;

Leaving out such players also distorts the uncertainty of relying on young, unproven kids. One assumed advantage of signing experienced players is that they are more of a known commodity, and that lesser risk factors into their monetary value. Expecting a draft pick to be a positive contributor out the gate for a world-class, professional sports team may be asking a little too much of a 19-year-old who would otherwise be in his sophomore year of college. Nevertheless, some players figure it out much quicker than others, some peak early and fizzle out, some never figure it out at all - the point is that you just don't know, and it's incredibly difficult to predict.

For these reasons, I plan to replicate this project including all players with no minutes cutoff.

&amp;nbsp;

There is also much more nuance in team-specific situations than this study suggests. Each team is on their own timeline in terms of competing, player development, owner outlook, market situation, and overall direction that is almost entirely overlooked here. Sometimes teams are forced to overpay key players or risk letting them walk for nothing in free agency. The free agent market often boils down to a take-what-you-can-get scenario for many teams - acquiring a certain player may be viewed as an overpay by the numbers and from the lens of outside observers, but in actuality represents a necessary step for a team to continue to improve.

&amp;nbsp;

Contracts also don't exist in a seasonal vacuum, and represent more than just compensation for on-court production. Teams may be willing to overpay aging stars in order to contend in the present (eg. Chris Paul and the Rockets). Expiring contracts represent strategic, roster-building value distinct from the on-court production of the players to which they are attached. The magnitude of contracts reflects the state of the free agency market around the time of the signing; weak markets lead to a negative feedback loop and overpaying players, as [John Hollinger points out in his Athletic article](https://theathletic.com/1312762/2019/10/22/hollinger-how-next-summers-weak-free-agency-class-impacted-nba-contract-extension-deadline/).

&amp;nbsp;

The way in which we perceive contract value is flawed, too. Postseason success is too often the focal point through which we judge front office and coaching decisions, which may serve to create a revisionist timeline more often than not. While signing a player can be seen as a safe gamble at the time, perception of the deal can quickly sour if that roll of the dice turns out unfavorably due to injury or other misfortune.

&amp;nbsp;

However, the goal was never to come up with an approach that accounts for all of the above and churns out a one-size-fits-all solution. The objective, rather, is much less ambitious. It is simply to add another tool to our belt - one that helps us shine more light on a specific component of the problem, that we can use in conjunction with other contextual clues to evaluate each situation. The results of this project provide a quantifiable addition to any discussion about a player's value.

#Which Teams Capitalize Most on this Value?

Earlier I touched on the importance of acquiring underpaid talent, given its extraordinary value. An interesting next step would be to look at the teams who have excelled in this department and whether they've employed any unique strategies in doing so.

&amp;nbsp;

Front offices have many avenues through which to improve their rosters, whether it be through the draft, free agency, trades, or internal development. Teams located in larger, more attractive markets can lean on free agency as a bigger tool in roster building, whereas other teams must survive through calculated trades and developing their own talent. The latter category includes teams like the Spurs, Nets, Blazers and Heat which have relied on building a strong culture of professionalism and player development.

This past season, Pascal Siakam emerged as the champion Raptors' second-best player at times, while being paid in the 12th percentile of all NBA players. Stephen Curry's ankle issues led him to be famously underpaid during his MVP seasons and set the stage for his Warriors' mid-2010s dominance. You could make a convincing argument that LeBron James has been worth far more than his max contract for his on-court contributions alone.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

On the flip side, bloated contracts given to underperforming stars or even middling role players can severely restrict the flexibility and ultimately the success of their teams. All Wolves' owner Glen Taylor needed to see from Andrew Wiggins before handing him a max contract was a handful of subpar chucking seasons and an (unfulfilled) \[promise that he would improve\]([https://sports.yahoo.com/timberwolves-just-want-andrew-wiggins-promise-hell-get-better-200047839.html](https://sports.yahoo.com/timberwolves-just-want-andrew-wiggins-promise-hell-get-better-200047839.html)). Wiggins' ill-advised contract contributed to the downfall of the Wolves' short-lived return to relevance in 2018, and may eventually cost them the opportunity to retain Karl-Anthony Towns.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, this a pretty straightforward concept - acquire high-value players and avoid having overpaid players on the roster. But is there anything more to this strategy that we can uncover? Are there certain types of players that tend to exist under the radar? What exactly constitutes a ""high-value"" player?

&amp;#x200B;

\#Salary Scores and VORP Scores

&amp;#x200B;

My working definition of value is production in relation to salary. For two players with a given level of production, the player who is paid less than the other has more value. But how should we measure salary and production?

&amp;#x200B;

In order to form an effective basis for comparison across seasons, we need to scale salaries relative to each season. Otherwise a max contract from a decade ago would look like insane value compared to a similar size contract today. Case in point: Kobe Bryant in 2005 made $14.1 million. A similar salary today would net you players like Kelly Oubre, Marvin Williams, or Eric Gordon.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to salary, we need a production metric. I chose VORP for the job given that it has a decent reputation as advanced metrics go and is widely available in Basketball Reference for the scope of this study. Because VORP is calculated to be era-independent, I scaled VORP relative to all seasons (2003-2019).

&amp;#x200B;

To compute both Salary Score and VORP Score, I rescaled the original variables such that the means have a value of 0 and the standard deviations have a value of 1.

&amp;#x200B;

I went as far back as 2003, when the NBA introduced the modern salary cap and luxury tax system that remains in place today. Before 2003 you had contracts exceeding the entire cap - but with different luxury tax incentives, teams and players behaved differently. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

So with these rescaled tools, we can plot all players from 2003-2019 on \[one chart\]([https://i.imgur.com/75AvJmx.png](https://i.imgur.com/75AvJmx.png)).

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

We can begin to tease out an idea of value from this chart: remember that a positive Salary Score represents a salary above league average for that season, while a positive VORP Score represents a VORP above league average for the entirety of the 2003-2019 seasons. Thus, a player with a positive salary score and a negative VORP score can be identified as having poor value, and the opposite for a player with great value.

&amp;#x200B;

It gets a little murkier around the middle portion of the plot, where salary score and VORP score are similar. Just how valuable is a player that is paid highly yet falls slightly short in terms of production? How about a player that is paid slightly above average but produces well above average? There exists a delicate balance between the value of cap space and the rarity of big-time contributors - where exactly does the equilibrium fall?

&amp;#x200B;

A great many players are scrunched into that bottom left corner - that means they're below average in both salary and production. These players aren't difference makers on the court, nor on the team's books, so their value doesn't move the needle.

&amp;#x200B;

So we visually laid out players in a way that we can tease out some assumptions about value. But we need to more explicitly define this idea of \*value\*.

&amp;#x200B;

\#Adding a Value Gradient

&amp;#x200B;

The tricky part in defining value is finding the balance in valuing production as magnitude of contract increases. The value of VORP does not progress at a one-to-one rate with salary - higher production players are increasingly rare and should be compensated accordingly. A player with a VORP of 5.0 should be worth more than two players each with a VORP of 2.5.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, cap space itself is highly valued, and a player taking up large amounts of cap room while not living up to their contract acts as a deadweight to a team that is now severely handicapped in building out the rest of the roster.

&amp;#x200B;

To come up with my Value Score, I created an expected salary for each player based on their VORP for that season. Then I subtracted the player's actual salary from their expected salary to get the first component of the Value Score. Then, in order to account for the rarity of higher production players, I added VORP Score as a second component to the Value Score. The end result, besides the ability to quantifiably rank player value, is \[this value gradient\]([https://i.imgur.com/z5HnHXa.png](https://i.imgur.com/z5HnHXa.png)).

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

The diagonal line represents the ""break-even curve"" where value score is calculated to be zero - players above and to the left are of below-average value, and players below and to the right of the curve are of above-average value.

&amp;#x200B;

The graph above confirms our intuitions about where the high and low value players reside, also giving us some clarity in the murky middle region of the graph.

&amp;#x200B;

Time to put it to use!

&amp;#x200B;

Again - 4 out of 10 players still on their rookie contracts. The rest? Giannis and Harden finished 1st and 2nd in MVP voting, respectfully; Vucevic had a career year on a very team-friendly salary; and Gobert's fourth-place finish in VORP lives up to his lofty salary, a scenario that Value Score (ahem) values highly.

&amp;#x200B;

Nikola Jokic, despite being in his fourth year, was not on his rookie deal due to the fact that he was a second-round pick. Second-rounders aren't subject to the same salary structure as first-rounders. He is still totally worth every dollar of that contract though.

&amp;#x200B;

There seems to be a trend we're noticing here, which leads us to...

&amp;#x200B;

\#The Value of Rookie Contracts

&amp;#x200B;

The NBA introduced rookie scale contracts in 1995 in response to the growing number of absurdly large deals given to young, unproven rookies. The structure of these rookie contracts allows teams to retain their first-rounders for up to 4 seasons at a predetermined rate depending on their draft position.

&amp;#x200B;

Given the amount of uncertainty involved with projecting future success at such a young age, the structure makes a lot of sense. For the rookies, it represents guaranteed money upon being drafted, their first taste of (monetary) success. But for the standouts - those who enter the league as positive contributors, or become one after a season or two - this contract structure serves to artificially depress their salary, and thus lead to incredible value for their team. 

&amp;#x200B;

\[Check out this visual\]([https://i.imgur.com/Tzz8gK8.png](https://i.imgur.com/Tzz8gK8.png)) which charts player salary against season number.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

As the graphic above depicts, players in their first 4 seasons are vastly over-represented in the lower 50 percentile of salaries, which immediately shifts from season 5 on, when many rookie-scale contracts end. But does player production follow a similar progression?

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

\[Not at all.\]([https://i.imgur.com/0ZjQuWg.png](https://i.imgur.com/0ZjQuWg.png)) By their third seasons, players' VORPs start to closely resemble those of more experienced players. This means that some of the most valuable contracts in the league, on a season-by-season basis, tend to be players in their third or fourth seasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\[This graphic\]([https://i.imgur.com/nvr2455.png](https://i.imgur.com/nvr2455.png)) charts Salary Score by VORP Score, but separates players' seasons by season number.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

\[Here's all of them squashed into one graph\]([https://i.imgur.com/pEsDpIL.png](https://i.imgur.com/pEsDpIL.png)) for a different look. Blue points represent players in their first four seasons, while red points denote players in their fifth seasons and on.

&amp;#x200B;

Note the solid value growth throughout the first four seasons, underscored by the dramatic shift from season four to season five.

&amp;#x200B;

As an aside: The goal here is not to uncover some hidden strategy - it's no secret that players who develop into positive contributors while still on their rookie-scale contracts get the most bang for their buck. Nevertheless, I think visualizing the scope of their value in comparison to more experienced players is pretty striking. 

&amp;#x200B;

\#Bottom Line: Young Players Who Pan Out are Insanely Valuable.

&amp;#x200B;

...Until they sign their second contract, that is. Teams that hold the rights to the player hold a distinct advantage over others when it comes to retaining that player in terms of total salary and years offered. Valuing that contract, however, is especially tricky, as teams have to take into account future growth and injury risk, evaluate the player's fit and role within the team, and fight off other potential suitors. But before they sign that second contract...

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

Their value multiplies two-fold when you consider the cap flexibility retained by the team. Not only does the team reap the benefits of outsized productivity from a young, underpaid player, but they also maintain the wiggle room to acquire and keep additional talent.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

If team like the Sixers manages to acquire a Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, two star-level players still on their rookie contracts, it leaves them with ample cap space to sign another star in Horford and put together a cast of high-level supporting players. The Sixers may face a troubling cap scenario when Embiid and Simmons' extensions both kick in, but for now they remain one of the favorites to come out of the East.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

These results only magnify the importance of identifying and acquiring young talent. If a team can create a competitive advantage through the draft and hit on more draft picks than average, they can reap the benefits of their inflated value. Easier said than done, of course, but teams like the San Antonio Spurs have shown a consistent edge in finding talented young players later in the draft, which is a large component of their continued success.

&amp;#x200B;

\#Next Steps

&amp;#x200B;

I ran into a few problems during the course of this project that need a little working around. Only players with over 800 minutes played on the season are included in the dataset, which leaves out some players on albatross contracts that sat out the entire season (Chandler Parsons comes to mind, also John Wall for this upcoming season) and the exclusion of which could skew the data.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

Leaving out such players also distorts the uncertainty of relying on young, unproven kids. One assumed advantage of signing experienced players is that they are more of a known commodity, and that lesser risk factors into their monetary value. Expecting a draft pick to be a positive contributor out the gate for a world-class, professional sports team may be asking a little too much of a 19-year-old who would otherwise be in his sophomore year of college. Nevertheless, some players figure it out much quicker than others, some peak early and fizzle out, some never figure it out at all - the point is that you just don't know, and it's incredibly difficult to predict.

&amp;#x200B;

For these reasons, I plan to replicate this project including all players with no minutes cutoff.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

There is also much more nuance in team-specific situations than this study suggests. Each team is on their own timeline in terms of competing, player development, owner outlook, market situation, and overall direction that is almost entirely overlooked here. Sometimes teams are forced to overpay key players or risk letting them walk for nothing in free agency. The free agent market often boils down to a take-what-you-can-get scenario for many teams - acquiring a certain player may be viewed as an overpay by the numbers and from the lens of outside observers, but in actuality represents a necessary step for a team to continue to improve.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

Contracts also don't exist in a seasonal vacuum, and represent more than just compensation for on-court production. Teams may be willing to overpay aging stars in order to contend in the present (eg. Chris Paul and the Rockets). Expiring contracts represent strategic, roster-building value distinct from the on-court production of the players to which they are attached. The magnitude of contracts reflects the state of the free agency market around the time of the signing; weak markets lead to a negative feedback loop and overpaying players, as \[John Hollinger points out in his Athletic article\]([https://theathletic.com/1312762/2019/10/22/hollinger-how-next-summers-weak-free-agency-class-impacted-nba-contract-extension-deadline/](https://theathletic.com/1312762/2019/10/22/hollinger-how-next-summers-weak-free-agency-class-impacted-nba-contract-extension-deadline/)).

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

The way in which we perceive contract value is flawed, too. Postseason success is too often the focal point through which we judge front office and coaching decisions, which may serve to create a revisionist timeline more often than not. While signing a player can be seen as a safe gamble at the time, perception of the deal can quickly sour if that roll of the dice turns out unfavorably due to injury or other misfortune.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

However, the goal was never to come up with an approach that accounts for all of the above and churns out a one-size-fits-all solution. The objective, rather, is much less ambitious. It is simply to add another tool to our belt - one that helps us shine more light on a specific component of the problem, that we can use in conjunction with other contextual clues to evaluate each situation. The results of this project provide a quantifiable addition to any discussion about a player's value.

&amp;#x200B;

\#Which Teams Capitalize Most on this Value?

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier I touched on the importance of acquiring underpaid talent, given its extraordinary value. An interesting next step would be to look at the teams who have excelled in this department and whether they've employed any unique strategies in doing so.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

Front offices have many avenues through which to improve their rosters, whether it be through the draft, free agency, trades, or internal development. Teams located in larger, more attractive markets can lean on free agency as a bigger tool in roster building, whereas other teams must survive through calculated trades and developing their own talent. The latter category includes teams like the Spurs, Nets, Blazers and Heat which have relied on building a strong culture of professionalism and player development.

&gt; Harden has been awful to star off the season but he is going to get out of his shooting slump eventually. His shooting has been pretty bad and he just looks pretty sloppy at times. I believe one of the reasons is the new change in pace the Rockets are playing with WB on the floor; WB tends to play at a faster pace and brings the ball up at a much faster pace. Harden on the other hand eases into the half court set and I think this could be a reason as Harden is getting gassed faster.

&gt; This shouldn't be a concern as it isn't a huge reason for his struggles and it's most likely just his shooting.

&gt; WB is absolutely electric and energetic; someone the Rockets desperately needed. The spacing provides him with so much room and he is making use of it really well. There is no hope of containing him if he gets an extra step. 

&gt; He has been passing the ball really well. Already shows good chemistry with Capella and is making good passes out to the shooters and finding the open man. 

&gt; I used to buy into the story that WB steals rebounds from Adams to stat-pad but I couldn't be more wrong. His athleticism allows them to get number of offensive and defensive rebounds (especially against the Bucks) and while he has never been a lock down defender he has done a great job reading the passing lanes and doubling at the right time. 

**Once Harden bounces back from the slump this team is going to be deadly on offense. One of the main reasons why Rockets struggled so much in the post-season was because of not having a secondary play-maker who could will the team to a win when Harden was shooting really bad. While CP3 is amazing he was never the type to drive to the paint to get force defenders to double or drawl a foul, WB with the spacing is elite at getting to the paint.**

* 2016 LeBron James (5.7 WAR)
* 2017 LeBron James (5.8 WAR)

Wiggins\' ill-advised contract contributed to the downfall of the Wolves\' short-lived return to relevance in 2018, and may eventually cost them the opportunity to retain Karl-Anthony Towns.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI mean, this a pretty straightforward concept - acquire high-value players and avoid having overpaid players on the roster. But is there anything more to this strategy that we can uncover? Are there certain types of players that tend to exist under the radar? What exactly constitutes a ""high-value"" player?\n\n#Salary Scores and VORP Scores\n\nMy working definition of value is production in relation to salary. For two players with a given level of production, the player who is paid less than the other has more value. But how should we measure salary and production?\n\nIn order to form an effective basis for comparison across seasons, we need to scale salaries relative to each season. Otherwise a max contract from a decade ago would look like insane value compared to a similar size contract today. Case in point: Kobe Bryant in 2005 made $14.1 million. A similar salary today would net you players like Kelly Oubre, Marvin Williams, or Eric Gordon.\n\nIn addition to salary, we need a production metric. I chose VORP for the job given that it has a decent reputation as advanced metrics go and is widely available in Basketball Reference for the scope of this study. Because VORP is calculated to be era-independent, I scaled VORP relative to all seasons (2003-2019).\n\nTo compute both Salary Score and VORP Score, I rescaled the original variables such that the means have a value of 0 and the standard deviations have a value of 1.\n\nI went as far back as 2003, when the NBA introduced the modern salary cap and luxury tax system that remains in place today. Before 2003 you had contracts exceeding the entire cap - but with different luxury tax incentives, teams and players behaved differently. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo with these rescaled tools, we can plot all players from 2003-2019 on [one chart](https://i.imgur.com/75AvJmx.png).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe can begin to tease out an idea of value from this chart: remember that a positive Salary Score represents a salary above league average for that season, while a positive VORP Score represents a VORP above league average for the entirety of the 2003-2019 seasons. Thus, a player with a positive salary score and a negative VORP score can be identified as having poor value, and the opposite for a player with great value.\n\nIt gets a little murkier around the middle portion of the plot, where salary score and VORP score are similar. Just how valuable is a player that is paid highly yet falls slightly short in terms of production? How about a player that is paid slightly above average but produces well above average? There exists a delicate balance between the value of cap space and the rarity of big-time contributors - where exactly does the equilibrium fall?\n\nA great many players are scrunched into that bottom left corner - that means they\'re below average in both salary and production. These players aren\'t difference makers on the court, nor on the team\'s books, so their value doesn\'t move the needle.\n\nSo we visually laid out players in a way that we can tease out some assumptions about value. But we need to more explicitly define this idea of *value*.\n\n#Adding a Value Gradient\n\nThe tricky part in defining value is finding the balance in valuing production as magnitude of contract increases. The value of VORP does not progress at a one-to-one rate with salary - higher production players are increasingly rare and should be compensated accordingly. A player with a VORP of 5.0 should be worth more than two players each with a VORP of 2.5.\n\nAt the same time, cap space itself is highly valued, and a player taking up large amounts of cap room while not living up to their contract acts as a deadweight to a team that is now severely handicapped in building out the rest of the roster.\n\nTo come up with my Value Score, I created an expected salary for each player based on their VORP for that season. Then I subtracted the player\'s actual salary from their expected salary to get the first component of the Value Score. Then, in order to account for the rarity of higher production players, I added VORP Score as a second component to the Value Score. The end result, besides the ability to quantifiably rank player value, is [this value gradient](https://i.imgur.com/z5HnHXa.png).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe diagonal line represents the ""break-even curve"" where value score is calculated to be zero - players above and to the left are of below-average value, and players below and to the right of the curve are of above-average value.\n\nThe graph above confirms our intuitions about where the high and low value players reside, also giving us some clarity in the murky middle region of the graph.\n\nTime to put it to use!\n\n#Which Player is the Most Undervalued?\n\n**Here are the top 20 most undervalued player seasons since 2003:**\n\n|player|season|age|season number|team|sal|vorp|value score|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|Chris Paul|2009|23|4|NOH|$4.6m|10|8.29|\n|LeBron James|2006|21|3|CLE|$4.6m|9.5|7.79|\n|LeBron James|2005|20|2|CLE|$4.3m|8.8|7.75|\n|Chris Paul|2008|22|3|NOH|$3.6m|8.5|7.6|\n|Andrei Kirilenko|2004|22|3|UTA|$1.0m|7.5|7.43|\n|Stephen Curry|2016|27|7|GSW|$11.4m|9.8|6.66|\n|Giannis Antetokounmpo|2017|22|4|MIL|$3.0m|6.9|6.58|\n|LeBron James|2009|24|6|CLE|$14.4m|11.6|6.54|\n|Dwyane Wade|2006|24|3|MIA|$3.0m|7.0|6.44|\n|LeBron James|2008|23|5|CLE|$13m|10.1|6.29|\n|LeBron James|2007|22|4|CLE|$5.8m|7.6|6.2|\n|Shawn Marion|2003|24|4|PHO|$2.3m|6.4|6.14|\n|Dwyane Wade|2009|27|6|MIA|$14.4m|9.7|5.91|\n|Tracy McGrady|2003|23|6|ORL|$12.1m|8.7|5.86|\n|LeBron James|2010|25|7|CLE|$15.8m|10.9|5.79|\n|Kevin Garnett|2005|28|10|MIN|$16m|9.3|5.71|\n|LeBron James|2013|28|10|MIA|$17.5m|9.8|5.68|\n|Nikola Jokic|2018|22|3|DEN|$1.5m|5.6|5.63|\n|Stephen Curry|2015|26|6|GSW|$10.6m|7.9|5.45|\n|Brandon Roy|2009|24|3|POR|$3.1m|5.7|5.36|\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n11 out of the 20 seasons are from budding young stars still on their rookie contracts.

Derrick Rose\'s third comeback effort in as many seasons (after as many knee surgeries...) makes the cut. And then you have... Andrew Wiggins.\n\n[Here is a visualization of the above tables](https://i.imgur.com/v7ScZZO.png), overlayed onto the value gradient.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor a more recent flavor, let\'s take a look at the **most undervalued players from this past season (2019):**\n\n|player|age|season number|team|sal|vorp|value score|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|Karl-Anthony Towns|23|4|MIN|$7.8m|5.7|4.82|\n|James Harden|29|10|HOU|$30.4m|9.9|4.72|\n|Giannis Antetokounmpo|24|6|MIL|$24.2m|7.6|4.13|\n|Nikola Jokic|23|4|DEN|$24.6m|7.3|3.83|\n|Nikola Vucevic|28|8|ORL|$12.8m|5.3|3.7|\n|Pascal Siakam|24|3|TOR|$1.5m|3.5|3.48|\n|Ben Simmons|22|2|PHI|$6.4m|4.1|3.4|\n|Luka Doncic|19|1|DAL|$6.6m|3.6|2.85|\n|Rudy Gobert|26|6|UTA|$23.2m|5.9|2.75|\n|Montrezl Harrell|25|4|LAC|$6.0m|3.4|2.73|\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAgain - 4 out of 10 players still on their rookie contracts. The rest? Giannis and Harden finished 1st and 2nd in MVP voting, respectfully; Vucevic had a career year on a very team-friendly salary; and Gobert\'s fourth-place finish in VORP lives up to his lofty salary, a scenario that Value Score (ahem) values highly.\n\nNikola Jokic, despite being in his fourth year, was not on his rookie deal due to the fact that he was a second-round pick. Second-rounders aren\'t subject to the same salary structure as first-rounders. He is still totally worth every dollar of that contract though.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**And now for underperformers in 2019:**\n\n|player|age|season number|team|sal|vorp|value score|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|Andrew Wiggins|23|5|MIN|$25.5m|-0.6|-4.12|\n|Harrison Barnes|26|7|DAL/SAC|$24.1m|-0.2|-3.58|\n|Gordon Hayward|28|8|BOS|$31.2m|1.2|-3.28|\n|Jabari Parker|23|5|CHI/WAS|$20.0m|0.0|-2.79|\n|Jeff Teague|30|10|MIN|$19.0m|-0.1|-2.73|\n|Otto Porter|25|6|WAS/CHI|$26.0m|1.0|-2.71|\n|Chris Paul|33|14|HOU|$35.7m|2.4|-2.69|\n|Dennis Schroder|25|6|OKC|$15.5m|-0.6|-2.66|\n|Allen Crabbe|26|6|BRK|$18.5m|-0.1|-2.65|\n|Kent Bazemore|29|7|ATL|$18.1m|-0.1|-2.59|\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWould you look at that - Wiggins takes the cake for most overvalued player of the 2018-19 season. And on the other end of the spectrum? His teammate, Karl-Anthony Towns. \n\n[For your visual reference:](https://i.imgur.com/Bel2GVx.png)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Here\'s a link to the full value dataset.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1szjxw6ZJYjsIKnddoDmr-_bRAZFt6gz1/view?usp=sharing)\n\nThere seems to be a trend we\'re noticing here, which leads us to...\n\n#The Value of Rookie Contracts\n\nThe NBA introduced rookie scale contracts in 1995 in response to the growing number of absurdly large deals given to young, unproven rookies. The structure of these rookie contracts allows teams to retain their first-rounders for up to 4 seasons at a predetermined rate depending on their draft position.\n\nGiven the amount of uncertainty involved with projecting future success at such a young age, the structure makes a lot of sense. For the rookies, it represents guaranteed money upon being drafted, their first taste of (monetary) success. But for the standouts - those who enter the league as positive contributors, or become one after a season or two - this contract structure serves to artificially depress their salary, and thus lead to incredible value for their team. \n\n[Check out this visual](https://i.imgur.com/Tzz8gK8.png) which charts player salary against season number.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs the graphic above depicts, players in their first 4 seasons are vastly over-represented in the lower 50 percentile of salaries, which immediately shifts from season 5 on, when many rookie-scale contracts end. But does player production follow a similar progression?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Not at all.](https://i.imgur.com/0ZjQuWg.png) By their third seasons, players\' VORPs start to closely resemble those of more experienced players. This means that some of the most valuable contracts in the league, on a season-by-season basis, tend to be players in their third or fourth seasons. \n\n\n[This graphic](https://i.imgur.com/nvr2455.png) charts Salary Score by VORP Score, but separates players\' seasons by season number.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Here\'s all of them squashed into one graph](https://i.imgur.com/pEsDpIL.png) for a different look. Blue points represent players in their first four seasons, while red points denote players in their fifth seasons and on.\n\nNote the solid value growth throughout the first four seasons, underscored by the dramatic shift from season four to season five.\n\nAs an aside: The goal here is not to uncover some hidden strategy - it\'s no secret that players who develop into positive contributors while still on their rookie-scale contracts get the most bang for their buck. Nevertheless, I think visualizing the scope of their value in comparison to more experienced players is pretty striking. \n\n#Bottom Line: Young Players Who Pan Out are Insanely Valuable.\n\n...Until they sign their second contract, that is. Teams that hold the rights to the player hold a distinct advantage over others when it comes to retaining that player in terms of total salary and years offered. Valuing that contract, however, is especially tricky, as teams have to take into account future growth and injury risk, evaluate the player\'s fit and role within the team, and fight off other potential suitors. But before they sign that second contract...\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTheir value multiplies two-fold when you consider the cap flexibility retained by the team. Not only does the team reap the benefits of outsized productivity from a young, underpaid player, but they also maintain the wiggle room to acquire and keep additional talent.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf team like the Sixers manages to acquire a Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, two star-level players still on their rookie contracts, it leaves them with ample cap space to sign another star in Horford and put together a cast of high-level supporting players. The Sixers may face a troubling cap scenario when Embiid and Simmons\' extensions both kick in, but for now they remain one of the favorites to come out of the East.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThese results only magnify the importance of identifying and acquiring young talent. If a team can create a competitive advantage through the draft and hit on more draft picks than average, they can reap the benefits of their inflated value. Easier said than done, of course, but teams like the San Antonio Spurs have shown a consistent edge in finding talented young players later in the draft, which is a large component of their continued success.\n\n#Next Steps\n\nI ran into a few problems during the course of this project that need a little working around. Only players with over 800 minutes played on the season are included in the dataset, which leaves out some players on albatross contracts that sat out the entire season (Chandler Parsons comes to mind, also John Wall for this upcoming season) and the exclusion of which could skew the data.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLeaving out such players also distorts the uncertainty of relying on young, unproven kids. One assumed advantage of signing experienced players is that they are more of a known commodity, and that lesser risk factors into their monetary value. Expecting a draft pick to be a positive contributor out the gate for a world-class, professional sports team may be asking a little too much of a 19-year-old who would otherwise be in his sophomore year of college. Nevertheless, some players figure it out much quicker than others, some peak early and fizzle out, some never figure it out at all - the point is that you just don\'t know, and it\'s incredibly difficult to predict.\n\nFor these reasons, I plan to replicate this project including all players with no minutes cutoff.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere is also much more nuance in team-specific situations than this study suggests. Each team is on their own timeline in terms of competing, player development, owner outlook, market situation, and overall direction that is almost entirely overlooked here. Sometimes teams are forced to overpay key players or risk letting them walk for nothing in free agency. The free agent market often boils down to a take-what-you-can-get scenario for many teams - acquiring a certain player may be viewed as an overpay by the numbers and from the lens of outside observers, but in actuality represents a necessary step for a team to continue to improve.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nContracts also don\'t exist in a seasonal vacuum, and represent more than just compensation for on-court production. Teams may be willing to overpay aging stars in order to contend in the present (eg. Chris Paul and the Rockets). Expiring contracts represent strategic, roster-building value distinct from the on-court production of the players to which they are attached. The magnitude of contracts reflects the state of the free agency market around the time of the signing; weak markets lead to a negative feedback loop and overpaying players, as [John Hollinger points out in his Athletic article](https://theathletic.com/1312762/2019/10/22/hollinger-how-next-summers-weak-free-agency-class-impacted-nba-contract-extension-deadline/).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe way in which we perceive contract value is flawed, too. Postseason success is too often the focal point through which we judge front office and coaching decisions, which may serve to create a revisionist timeline more often than not. While signing a player can be seen as a safe gamble at the time, perception of the deal can quickly sour if that roll of the dice turns out unfavorably due to injury or other misfortune.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHowever, the goal was never to come up with an approach that accounts for all of the above and churns out a one-size-fits-all solution. The objective, rather, is much less ambitious. It is simply to add another tool to our belt - one that helps us shine more light on a specific component of the problem, that we can use in conjunction with other contextual clues to evaluate each situation. The results of this project provide a quantifiable addition to any discussion about a player\'s value.\n\n#Which Teams Capitalize Most on this Value?\n\nEarlier I touched on the importance of acquiring underpaid talent, given its extraordinary value. An interesting next step would be to look at the teams who have excelled in this department and whether they\'ve employed any unique strategies in doing so.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFront offices have many avenues through which to improve their rosters, whether it be through the draft, free agency, trades, or internal development. Teams located in larger, more attractive markets can lean on free agency as a bigger tool in roster building, whereas other teams must survive through calculated trades and developing their own talent. The latter category includes teams like the Spurs, Nets, Blazers and Heat which have relied on building a strong culture of professionalism and player development. More on that to come!', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great teams benefit from employing players who vastly outperform their contracts.

A player with a VORP of 5.0 should be worth more than two players each with a VORP of 2.5.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the same time, cap space itself is highly valued, and a player taking up large amounts of cap room while not living up to their contract acts as a deadweight to a team that is now severely handicapped in building out the rest of the roster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To come up with my Value Score, I created an expected salary for each player based on their VORP for that season. Then I subtracted the player&amp;#39;s actual salary from their expected salary to get the first component of the Value Score. Then, in order to account for the rarity of higher production players, I added VORP Score as a second component to the Value Score. The end result, besides the ability to quantifiably rank player value, is &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/z5HnHXa.png""&gt;this value gradient&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The diagonal line represents the &amp;quot;break-even curve&amp;quot; where value score is calculated to be zero - players above and to the left are of below-average value, and players below and to the right of the curve are of above-average value.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The graph above confirms our intuitions about where the high and low value players reside, also giving us some clarity in the murky middle region of the graph.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Time to put it to use!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Which Player is the Most

explanation needed; Steph Curry - whose aforementioned ankle issues suppressed his value until he blossomed into an all-time great; and a handful of superstars at the absolute peak of their game - 2003 McGrady, 2005 Garnett, and 2009 Wade. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top 20 most overvalued seasons since

The rest? Giannis and Harden finished 1st and 2nd in MVP voting, respectfully; Vucevic had a career year on a very team-friendly salary; and Gobert&amp;#39;s fourth-place finish in VORP lives up to his lofty salary, a scenario that Value Score (ahem) values highly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nikola Jokic, despite being in his fourth year, was not on his rookie deal due to the fact that he was a second-round pick. Second-rounders aren&amp;#39;t subject to the same salary structure as first-rounders. He is still totally worth every dollar of that contract though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And now for underperformers in 2019:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=""left""&gt;player&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=""left""&gt;age&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=""left""&gt;season number&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=""left""&gt;team&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=""left""&gt;sal&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=""left""&gt;vorp&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=""left""&gt;value score&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Andrew Wiggins&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;23&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;MIN&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$25.5m&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;-0.6&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;-4.12&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Harrison Barnes&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;26&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;DAL/SAC&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$24.1m&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;-0.2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;-3.58&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Gordon Hayward&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;28&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;BOS&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$31.2m&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;1.2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;-3.28&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Jabari Parker&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;23&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;CHI/WAS&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$20.0m&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;0.0&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;-2.79&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Jeff Teague&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;30&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;MIN&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$19.0m&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;-0.1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;-2.73&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Otto Porter&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;25&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;WAS/CHI&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$26.0m&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;1.0&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;-2.71&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Chris Paul&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;33&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;HOU&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$35.7m&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2.4&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;-2.69&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Dennis Schroder&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;25&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;OKC&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$15.5m&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;-0.6&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;-2.66&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Allen Crabbe&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;26&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;BRK&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$18.5m&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;-0.1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;-2.65&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Kent Bazemore&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;29&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;ATL&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$18.1m&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;-0.1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;-2.59&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would you look at that - Wiggins takes the cake for most overvalued player of the 2018-19 season. And on the other end of the spectrum? His teammate, Karl-Anthony Towns. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/Bel2GVx.png""&gt;For your visual reference:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1szjxw6ZJYjsIKnddoDmr-_bRAZFt6gz1/view?usp=sharing""&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a link to the full value dataset.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a trend we&amp;#39;re noticing here, which leads us to...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The Value of Rookie Contracts&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The NBA introduced rookie scale contracts in 1995 in response to the growing number of absurdly large deals given to young, unproven rookies. The structure of these rookie contracts allows teams to retain their first-rounders for up to 4 seasons at a predetermined rate depending on their draft position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given the amount of uncertainty involved with projecting future success at such a young age, the structure makes a lot of sense. For the rookies, it represents guaranteed money upon being drafted, their first taste of (monetary) success. But for the standouts - those who enter the league as positive contributors, or become one after a season or two - this contract structure serves to artificially depress their salary, and thus lead to incredible value for their team. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/Tzz8gK8.png""&gt;Check out this visual&lt;/a&gt; which charts player salary against season number.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the graphic above depicts, players in their first 4 seasons are vastly over-represented in the lower 50 percentile of salaries, which immediately shifts from season 5 on, when many rookie-scale contracts end. But does player production follow a similar progression?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/0ZjQuWg.png""&gt;Not at all.&lt;/a&gt; By their third seasons, players&amp;#39; VORPs start to closely resemble those of more experienced players. This means that some of the most valuable contracts in the league, on a season-by-season basis, tend to be players in their third or fourth seasons. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/nvr2455.png""&gt;This graphic&lt;/a&gt; charts Salary Score by VORP Score, but separates players&amp;#39; seasons by season number.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/pEsDpIL.png""&gt;Here&amp;#39;s all of them squashed into one graph&lt;/a&gt; for a different look. Blue points represent players in their first four seasons, while red points denote players in their fifth seasons and on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note the solid value growth throughout the first four seasons, underscored by the dramatic shift from season four to season five.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an aside: The goal here is not to uncover some hidden strategy - it&amp;#39;s no secret that players who develop into positive contributors while still on their rookie-scale contracts get the most bang for their buck. Nevertheless, I think visualizing the scope of their value in comparison to more experienced players is pretty striking. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Bottom Line: Young Players Who Pan Out are Insanely Valuable.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...Until they sign their second contract, that is. Teams that hold the rights to the player hold a distinct advantage over others when it comes to retaining that player in terms of total salary and years offered. Valuing that contract, however, is especially tricky, as teams have to take into account future growth and injury risk, evaluate the player&amp;#39;s fit and role within the team, and fight off other potential suitors. But before they sign that second contract...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their value multiplies two-fold when you consider the cap flexibility retained by the team. Not only does the team reap the benefits of outsized productivity from a young, underpaid player, but they also maintain the wiggle room to acquire and keep additional talent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If team like the Sixers manages to acquire a Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, two star-level players still on their rookie contracts, it leaves them with ample cap space to sign another star in Horford and put together a cast of high-level supporting players. The Sixers may face a troubling cap scenario when Embiid and Simmons&amp;#39; extensions both kick in, but for now they remain one of the favorites to come out of the East.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These results only magnify the importance of identifying and acquiring young talent. If a team can create a competitive advantage through the draft and hit on more draft picks than average, they can reap the benefits of their inflated value. Easier said than done, of course, but teams like the San Antonio Spurs have shown a consistent edge in finding talented young players later in the draft, which is a large component of their continued success.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ran into a few problems during the course of this project that need a little working around. Only players with over 800 minutes played on the season are included in the dataset, which leaves out some players on albatross contracts that sat out the entire season (Chandler Parsons comes to mind, also John Wall for this upcoming season) and the exclusion of which could skew the data.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leaving out such players also distorts the uncertainty of relying on young, unproven kids. One assumed advantage of signing experienced players is that they are more of a known commodity, and that lesser risk factors into their monetary value. Expecting a draft pick to be a positive contributor out the gate for a world-class, professional sports team may be asking a little too much of a 19-year-old who would otherwise be in his sophomore year of college. Nevertheless, some players figure it out much quicker than others, some peak early and fizzle out, some never figure it out at all - the point is that you just don&amp;#39;t know, and it&amp;#39;s incredibly difficult to predict.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, I plan to replicate this project including all players with no minutes cutoff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is also much more nuance in team-specific situations than this study suggests. Each team is on their own timeline in terms of competing, player development, owner outlook, market situation, and overall direction that is almost entirely overlooked here. Sometimes teams are forced to overpay key players or risk letting them walk for nothing in free agency. The free agent market often boils down to a take-what-you-can-get scenario for many teams - acquiring a certain player may be viewed as an overpay by the numbers and from the lens of outside observers, but in actuality represents a necessary step for a team to continue to improve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Contracts also don&amp;#39;t exist in a seasonal vacuum, and represent more than just compensation for on-court production. Teams may be willing to overpay aging stars in order to contend in the present (eg. Chris Paul and the Rockets). Expiring contracts represent strategic, roster-building value distinct from the on-court production of the players to which they are attached. The magnitude of contracts reflects the state of the free agency market around the time of the signing; weak markets lead to a negative feedback loop and overpaying players, as &lt;a href=""https://theathletic.com/1312762/2019/10/22/hollinger-how-next-summers-weak-free-agency-class-impacted-nba-contract-extension-deadline/""&gt;John Hollinger points out in his Athletic article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way in which we perceive contract value is flawed, too. Postseason success is too often the focal point through which we judge front office and coaching decisions, which may serve to create a revisionist timeline more often than not. While signing a player can be seen as a safe gamble at the time, perception of the deal can quickly sour if that roll of the dice turns out unfavorably due to injury or other misfortune.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, the goal was never to come up with an approach that accounts for all of the above and churns out a one-size-fits-all solution. The objective, rather, is much less ambitious. It is simply to add another tool to our belt - one that helps us shine more light on a specific component of the problem, that we can use in conjunction with other contextual clues to evaluate each situation. The results of this project provide a quantifiable addition to any discussion about a player&amp;#39;s value.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Which Teams Capitalize Most on this Value?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Earlier I touched on the importance of acquiring underpaid talent, given its extraordinary value. An interesting next step would be to look at the teams who have excelled in this department and whether they&amp;#39;ve employed any unique strategies in doing so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Front offices have many avenues through which to improve their rosters, whether it be through the draft, free agency, trades, or internal development. Teams located in larger, more attractive markets can lean on free agency as a bigger tool in roster building, whereas other teams must survive through calculated trades and developing their own talent. The latter category includes teams like the Spurs, Nets, Blazers and Heat which have relied on building a strong culture of professionalism and player development.

Giannis was ***shut down*** in 4 games vs the league's best defense after 90+ games of league best play, including two games where the bucks smashed the raps despite shooting worse because giannis created a vast amount of oppurtunities. This matters even though it's a small sample.  


Kevin Durant manages more to's than shot attempts when curry is in foul trouble against a bad clippers defense despite having draymond green and klay to lessen his load and committed several turnovers again when curry went out vs the rockets to get his finger checked vs a mediocre rockets defense. Aooarently the first sample is fair game with Giannis vs an elite defense spcifically scheming against him as his team's offensive egine, but because Kerr doesn't trust kd as even a secondary playmaker for the warriors, ""small sample size"" is a legitimate excuse for KD's atrocious performance when taken out of an ideal situation.  


Niether curry, nor klay's playoff effiency improved with him in the playoffs(Klay's dropped dramatically), and his team magically went from 6-4 without him after going 6-4 with him, but apparently he's a better facilitator than players who actually ran their team's offenses vs elite defenses like Giannis or even Kawhi vs Philly.

Final two is up for grabs. Team in contention fmo are GS, SA, Kings, Mavs, and honestly Wolves.

  I think GS will be weaker but I think people over low that their roster is like a G-league team. If you take out Curry, Dray, D lo, Looney; Burks, WCS, Chriss, and GR3 have been rotation players in the NBA. Alec Burks was a longtime Jazz and has had playoff experience. If they can contribute eight he starters, GS can still be decent. If other young guys do well too it can a decent bench. If Gs can get sixth I wouldn’t count them out of anything. I take them at 7.

  Eight will be a three way tie cause I like the spurs as a team or more respect. I know they have the streak for longest playoff streak. But for me it’s a three way tie with Kong’s, Spurs, and Wolves.

  I honestly think Wolves might be good. KAT looks good and I think their depth might be alright. Layman was decent in Portland and guys like Okogie might make an impact. Maybe Wiggins moves to the bench and he can be a good sixth man. If they make a trade for a another scorer they can actually be a playoff team. I think the Mavs and Pelicans are a bit overrated.

Meanwhile, our coach held onto his one Coach's Challenge until midway through the 4th. Portland lost by 10. So it was used pretty much after the game was decided. 

This is kind of a recurring thing for Zach. He's this gangly, stiff-looking, tall white young guy, and I think refs see that and just call him on stuff when in doubt. He's actually shockingly agile and mobile though. 

I'd like to see Stotts use his one challenge to change the narrative on Collins. Instead of saving it, use it immediately every time there's an iffy call used on Zach. Tell the refs and the media before games that this is their strategy: if you are a ref and are calling anything on Zach, know that it's an automatic challenge for Portland. We'd just call it the Collin's Challenge instead of the Coach's Challenge (although of course the coach has to call for it). And if last night was any indication, refs are going to get embarrassed a lot. 

I think it's a really interesting way for any team to change the narrative on a developing defensive player. If Portland did this consistently over 10-20 games, guys like Zach Lowe would start talking about it and there'd be a buzz in the media and around the league about an innovative way to use the Challenge. 

Over time, I think the focus on Zach and the discussion of officiating would serve to wake refs up to his defense, and consequently give him more leeway in the playoffs and years to come. 

Right now there doesn't seem to be an agreed upon strategy for using the Coach's Callenge except as a one-shot way to fix a particular call.

Hey everyone - the NBA is back and this is my first video of the season. Unfortunately, it’s an injury to one of the most anticipated rookie phenoms in a minute - Zion Williamson. I took a detailed look at:

* The lateral meniscus tear injury
* The debridement surgery
* His return timeline
* Five potential underlying reasons:
   * Weight, activity fluctuations, biomechanics (landing, running, walking), risk/reward calculation, compensation
* Why a lateral meniscus tear, specifically, carries higher risk

For those at work or the hard of hearing, I've transcribed subtitles on YouTube so sound isn't required.

For reference, I'm a DPT with my own sports rehab &amp; performance clinics in West LA and Valencia, CA.

**This wasn't a bad game from the Lakers. They arguably had the biggest roster turnover and playing the first real NBA game against an elite defensive team in Clippers you are about to be exposed. They have quite a lot of work to do but the potential is certainly there.**

#####Offense####

**Playmaking: **

&gt; The lack of chemistry is quite clear and they had no fluidity or motion in the offense. LeBron was too passive and this could be him feeling out the team and trying to experiment with the passes and breaking down the defense. He was forcing passes and passes were misplaced and this was mainly because there wasn't enough chemistry between the team.  

&gt; They need a secondary ball handler. Cook or AB aren't capable enough to run the second unit and having Rondo or Caruso will certainly help in that regards. 

&gt; **Why didn't they run the PnR with AD and LeBron?** This was supposed to be the most efficient play for the Lakers and they didn't run it all that much. One of the reasons were that Clippers were going under the screen and LeBron's shot wasn't falling. The Clippers also have the personnel to switch in KL and Harrell and finally I believe LeBron wanted to be passive this game and see what AD and the team could do in general. 

**AD and Green**

&gt; AD was dominant in the post but the Lakers tried to have him post up way too much. You can't sustain this all game and definitely not all season long. He needs to work on his shot and post moves quite a bit as well. Defensively he wasn't as dominant as we'd expect but that's because Lakers as a whole were pretty rusty on that end

&gt; Danny Green was huge for them this game but the rest of the team couldn't quite hit their shots. This was the same throughout the preseason as well. As the season progress I'm hoping this improves and Vogel can make use of the Lakers shooting threat. The Clippers were able to double AD at time and ignore shooters but once Green started heating up they couldn't afford to send help.

**Defense: **

&gt; Lakers were bad in transition, weren't rotating fast enough, poor communication, leaving shooters open. I'm expecting lot of improvements in this regard. 

&gt; KCP played the best he could against KL but Leonard made some very difficult tough and not much you could do. 

&gt; Jared Dudley was really bad on that end of the floor. He would leave his man to double but neither commit not would close out the shooter. Kuzma should hopefully do a better job.

This is a completely statistical list, so if you are not open to that idea at all then i suggest you don't read the rest of this post. If you are still here, then full steam ahead.

The metric I created is called Value Shares.  I based it on the ideas behind win shares, but also took ideas from box plus minus. Without going too far into detail in this post, I essentially divided a team wins into offensive and defensive wins and then dived them up to the players. While determining player value, I took an emphasis on play making and efficiency, and i tried to give top end defensive players a higher share of a team's defensive wins than win shares does. Also, since this metric is based off of team success, players on better teams typical fare better than players who have a very heavy burden on bad teams. Value Shares are also adjusted for era (essentially, a 5 time all-star in todays league is far better than a 5 time all-star in the 50s). I also give out accolades to the top player (MVP), top five players (All NBA First Team), and top twenty five players (All-Star) for the regular season, as well as MVP and First Team of the Playoffs.

Value Shares was calculated for each regular season and playoffs a player played a single game.

The second metric is created is called Career Ranking. This is based entirely off of a player's Value Shares resume. It takes into account a players peak Value Shares of his top 3 seasons, average Value Shares over his top 10 seasons, and his total career value added. This exercise is done for both the regular season and the playoffs. Also, being the best player on a championship team is a VERY important factor in Career Ranking. All together, a players accolades and Value Shares resume 

This is a very vague explanation and there are probably a lot of questions I haven't answered, but I'll dive deeper later. Heres the list.

That's been a reality for my entire adult life. What's different about the 2019/20 iteration of the West is that there are 5 to 7 teams who should feel like they legitimately have a chance to come out of the conference.

My predictions are below. I encourage everyone to post theirs in the comment section.

TIER 1:

1) Los Angeles Clippers:

They might finish as low as the 4 seed. George is missing at least the first month of the season and Kawhi will likely be load managed. They are also missing a center that is capable of defending the elite 5’s of the NBA. That said, this is virtually the same team that obtained the 8 seed and then sniped a couple of victories away from the Warriors in round 1.

Landry Shamet and Lou Williams will provide a lethal scoring punch from the perimeter to go with Kawhi and George’s elite two-way play. JaMychal Green, Montrezl Herrell and Partick Bererley are all willing to put in the unglamorous dirty work that contribute to winning basketball. This might be the deepest team in the NBA which makes me think they can fight for the 1 seed even if George is out until December. And should their stars be healthy come playoff time, they should be the easy favorite to win it all.

2) Denver Nuggets:

The Nuggets were the youngest 2 seed in the history of the NBA last season. The same youthfulness that hindered them in the playoffs provides ample avenues for improvement in the 2019/20 season. Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray, Malik Beasley and Monte Morris are all a year closer to their prime. Gary Harris and Will Barton both struggled through serious injuries last season that clearly effected their efficiency, 3 point shot and confidence. A return to their previous form would instantly make the Nuggets a substantially better team. Offseason acquisition Jerami Grant provides badly needed rim protection and switchability while ensuring the Nuggets aren’t overly reliant on the aging (but still effective) Paul Milsap.

Nikola Jokic proved that he is one of the 10 best players in the NBA during that playoff run- his averages of 25/13/8.5 were historic in nature- and if the Clippers aren’t the deepest team in the NBA than the Nuggets are. That said, there are still serious questions that the Nuggets must answer in order to be a true contender. Can the electric but often erratic Jamal Murray become a more consistent player and cement himself as a true #2 option alongside Jokic? Will their lack of a clear starting level player at SF result in serious struggles against teams like the Clippers and Lakers? Can Michael Porter Jr. (who was in the conversation for the #1 overall pick in 2018 before a back injury caused him to plummet to the end of the lottery) make a positive impact as a rookie? These are the things that will determine how far Denver can go in the post-season… but regular season success is almost a given.

3) Utah Jazz:

The Jazz formula during the Rudy Gobert era has involved combining an elite defense with a clunky offense that was short on shooting and playmaking. It’s a situation that has left shooting guard Donovan Mitchell overburdened and inefficient even while he has flashed superstar level talent during his first two seasons in the NBA. Enter Mike Conley and Bojan Bogdanovic’.

Mike Conley might be the most underrated player of the past decade. It’s legitimately criminal that the verteran point guard has yet to make an NBA all-star game. He might not quite be the all-NBA level defender that he once was, but he’s still capable of shutting an opposing guard down. The subtraction of Rubio from the court combined with the addition of Conley and a 40% 3 point shooter in Bogdanovic will provide floor spacing that has been non-existent in past seasons. Mitchell will be free to cut around screens and spot up while defenders scramble to close out: his efficiency should sky rocket.

On the other hand, the Jazz are going to be undersized at nearly every position. Their defense will have more holes for Gobert to cover than ever before. The league’s most impactful defender should be capable of picking up the slack, but it may take awhile for the Jazz to figure out how to play together. More importantly, the Jazz bench is rather mediocre. Jeff Green, Ed Davis and Royce O’ Neal are solid but unspectacular. None of the three is a reliable shot maker. Which leaves former lottery pick Emanuel Mudiay as a key wild card- particularly should the injury-prone Conley miss any time. I'm giving them the nod over Houston due to their lethal home court advantage, but that's presuming their key guys stay healthy.

4) Houston Rockets:

I hate the fit of the Westbook and Harden tandem come playoff time. Or at the end of close games when Westbrook is almost certain to steal shots from Harden while bricking a large chunk of them. Houston’s stars make for the most usage heavy duo of recent memory, and Westbrook’s lack of effort off-ball (and clunky 3 point shot) are well documented. But I also can’t bring myself to question Harden or D’ Antoni. 

Westbrook and Harden will both work hard to accommodate their games because they truly want to make it work. I also think Westbrook will benefit from the newfound spacing he will enjoy while playing within Houston’s 3 point heavy offense. Clint Cappella and Eric Gordon are both elite glue guys in their prime, and Daryl Morey has a track record of filling out the outer edges of his roster with capable players. They just better hope that PJ Tucker stays healthy because their big man depth is abysmal.

5) Los Angles Lakers:

Last year the many Lakers fans in my life shit all over me for predicting they would be a 6 seed. Such predictions were based off the fact that GM Rob Pelinka had filled the roster with players who were a) past their prime and b) a questionable fit alongside Lebron. This year, the question is whether there is enough depth to survive any time that Lebron or AD may miss. I actually think that this team should be the favorite to play the Clippers in the Western Conference Finals. The AD / Lebron pick and roll will be borderline unstoppable come playoff time. Teams like Utah and Denver are simply unequipped to stop it.

Yet as underrated as Danny Green is by casual fans, Kuzma is as equally overrated rated. Kyle is going to have to shoot way better than 30% from 3 this season in order to compensate for his piss-poor defense or the fact that he is one of the worst passing forwards in the NBA. Other than Danny and the star duo, this roster is comprised of players who are past their prime (Dwight, Rondo, Bradley) or who are one-way by nature (Kuzma, Cook, Caruso). It adds up to a team who will be lethal in the playoffs (when a team’s bench becomes less important), but may struggle to rack up wins on the nights that their star players are at less than 100%

6) Portland Trailblazers:

It feels disrespectful to have Portland this low after their improbable run to the Western Conference during last years playoffs. CJ and Dame might be the best backcourt duo in the NBA considering Klay Thompson will be rehabbing a torn ACL until at least mid-March, and this is a team that has repeatedly overcome its doubters  over the past decade... The questions for this iteration of the Blazers revolve around who exactly is going to play defense while the team awaits center Jusuf Nurkic’s return from a serious leg injury.

GM Neal Olshey brought in the enigmatic Hassan Whiteside to serve as the intern replacement, but he is a player who is known more for his temper-tantrums and stat padding than his defensive presence. Meanwhile, the two players most responsible for Portland’s wing defense over recent seasons (Harkless, Aminu) both left during free agency in what feels like a gamble related to upside. The offensive limitations of Aminu and Harkless had repeatedly proven to be a liability come playoff time and so Olshey decided to open up time for young players like Zach Collins and Anfernee Simons. He also added under achieving wings like Heronja and Bazermore with the hope that the Blazers top-notch coaching staff and a change of scenery could help those players find themselves. It adds up to a roster with a crazy amount of volatility in its potential outcomes despite a history of consistency.

TIER II:

7) Golden State Warriors:

This is not your 70 win 2015-16 Golden State Warriors. Stephen Curry is still in the conversation for the best player in the NBA and Draymond Green is still a defensive force when he is in shape and actually trying, but that’s about all that remains the same. Gone are key bench players like Iggy and Livingston. Gone are former starters (and defensive contributors) Bogut and Barnes. And while D’ Angelo Russell should help replicate the injured Klay Thompson on the offensive end, he will only add to their defensive woes. Looney is a plus player and perhaps Cauley-Stein can be salvaged by Steve Kerr, but that still leaves the Warriors leaning on a stable of players with a track record of being net negatives. Curry is going ball out in an attempt to cement his legacy and shut up the doubters, but any chance at serving as a playoff wild card will require that Curry not miss any time with injuries while keeping his fingers crossed that Klay is at full speed upon his return.

8) San Antonio Spurts:

Aldridge and Derozan are both on the wrong side of 30, the Spurs are overly reliant on the inefficiencies of the mid-range game, (to Pop's great annoyance) the team lost 3 point sharper shooter Davis Bertans to the Wizards... I understand there are question marks. Yet Popovich is the Bill Belichick of the NBA. He knows how to maximize the strengths of a roster while minimizing its weaknesses. 

The Spurs should also benefit from the return of Dejounte Murry from an ACL tear. The lengthy PG is a defensive stalwart and was poised for a breakout season before suffering an unfortunate knee injury prior to start of last season. Derick White should continue building off a post-season performance that caught a lot of eyes, and I expect Lonnie Walker to prove capable of contributing to winning basketball while flashing serious long-term upside. The sum of those parts should be enough to land the Spurs back in the playoffs.

9) Sacramento Kings: I think they will continue building on last season. Hield and Barnes are both quality starters and Marvin Bagley surprised me with his play last season. The Kings late season nose-dive coincided directly with Bagley's unfortunate injury. Last year's experiences should mean the Kings are less susceptible to blown 4th quarter leads (which were a habitual problem). But Fox is the key to their ceiling. If he takes another step towards stardom, this team is capable of winning 46 games and stealing the a playoff spot. They'll be feisty either way.

TIER III:

10) Dallas Mavericks: Luka and Portz is an interesting and hyper-talented duo. The problem is that their 3rd best player is arguably Seth Curry. Well, that and the fact that Portzingis is an injury prone 7’ 3” perimeter player who will be playing basketball for the first time in over a year and a half.

11) New Orleans Pelicans:

If Zion were healthy, this team would be listed at #9. Their roster is loaded with young talent (Lonzo, Ingram, Alexander-Walker) and solid veterans (Reddick, Favors). Jrue Holiday is wildly underrated and one of the league’s best two-way players. They will be defensively competent and Zion looked like a Shaq / Barkley hybrid during the pre-season. He also just tore his meniscus and will now be missing the first 25 or so games of the season. The Pelicans would be wise to take their time with his return and utilize that time getting their franchise cornerstone to shed some weight. Which means the playoffs may quickly become an after-thought.

12) Minnesota Timberwolves:

Towns must really wish that Wiggins was never signed to that max contract. Karl is going to be an offensive juggernaut but the talent around him is lacking or too young and raw to be relied upon. I’d put my money on the team trading Robert Covington or Jeff Teague and tanking should they get they right offer.

13) Oklahoma City Thunder:

Should they keep their roster as is, this team could finish as high as the 9 seed-- especially now that New Orleans will be without Zion for an extended period of time. And perhaps chasing the playoffs with a team comprised of solid veterans (Gallo, CP3, Adams) and uber talented sophomore Shai Gilgeous-Alexander proves the way to go. OCK is one of the NBA’s smallest markets, and I won't pretend to know whether the franchise has the stomach for an extended rebuild. 

That said, Gallo and Adams are liable to fetch a solid return for a contender that wants to find its Marc Gasol and tip the balance of power among the NBA’s elite. I’m also not sure how long Chris Paul will be willing to toil in mediocrity should either of those players get traded (or in the case of Gallo, hurt). Expect the Thunder to be very competitive in the early portion of the season before transitioning to a blatant tank when the new year flips.

TIER IV:

14) Phoenix Suns:

The Phoenix Suns are the only team in the NBA capable of challenging the New York Knicks in their incompetence. Management goes through coaching staffs faster than ABC pumps out new episodes of The Bachelor. The organization has utterly failed at nurturing blue-chip prospects and developing them into winning players. Rubio, Oubre, Saric and Baynes are solid pickups in a vacuum. Ayton and Booker could make for a potent offensive tandem in theory. But the reality is that the Suns should be treated as the anti-Spurs. Failure should be the expectation until proven otherwise.

15) Memphis Grizzlies:

Brandon Clarke, Jaren Jackson Jr. and Ja Morant have the makings of one of the NBA’s best young cores. Hell, Ja might be the favorite for RoTY now that Zion is missing a third of the season. But the West is brutal, the rest of the roster bare (with apologies to Kyle Anderson and Tyus Jones), and the kids have a long way to go before their talents are actualized into wins. They will be fun to watch in bursts while fighting for the worst record in the NBA.

WHO WINS THE WEST: Clippers over Nuggets (based off these seedings), but with Clippers over Lakers as most likely (because the Nuggets would lose to either team if on that side of the bracket).",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,68147,public,self,(OC) Western Conference Prediction Thread,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/dlny1i/oc_western_conference_prediction_thread/,,,,,,,,,,,1572197213.0,,,,,

I recently did a statistical analysis of all L2M reports from 2015 to 2019 with the focus to see if superstar calls do indeed exist even in the end of close games. This is the [link](https://medium.com/sportsraid/do-nba-superstars-really-get-all-the-calls-basketball-referees-bias-last-two-minute-reports-star-treatment-18123c6d46dd) to the article if anyone is interested.

At a high level, I've quantified **advantaged calls** as incorrect calls for the receiving player of fouls and incorrect no calls for the committing players of fouls. **Disadvantaged calls** as the opposite: incorrect no calls for receiving players and incorrect calls for committing players.

I then calculated rates by dividing the incorrect decisions over the sum of all correct and incorrect decisions. This is a [table that shows the advantaged and disadvantage rates for the top 10 players by total calls](https://miro.medium.com/max/2728/1*nnNBXlHMM_M3MS5QWW1m3A.png).

Here is a [graphic that shows player's by advantage and disadvantage rate](https://miro.medium.com/max/3304/1*DOIXZRMckDnp5KJ6sfZyjQ.png).

After splitting player into groups of **superstars, stars and non-stars**, I was able to show the differences in referee playcalling in

* [Comprehensive \(Offense + Defense\)](https://miro.medium.com/max/2892/1*KQZD-U0_meEi0V-DEM4Cmw.png)
* [Offense](https://miro.medium.com/max/2896/1*-PX9GU6ljG5zFO2FPiBbtw.png)
* [Defense](https://miro.medium.com/max/2900/1*CVfEiRcDcb5S-EUN3a11TA.png)

I was able to find that superstars are the most likely to be advantaged and disadvantaged in general. However on offense, they are **significantly more likely to be advantaged compared to their peers**. On defense, they are also the **most likely to be advantaged**. Though in general, the defensive is at an advantage in the last 2 minutes b/c referees tend to swallow their whistle and make less foul calls, which result in more in-correct no calls which favor the defense.

Other interesting tidbits from the article:

- **Curry is the only player in NBA history to average, in his career, at least 20 points per game and make at least 40 percent of his 3s (on at least 100 attempts)**. He’s the red dot in [this graph](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19304836/Steph_Curry_Stands_Alone.png)—the lone figure that far up and that far to the right.

- **On the [single-season leaderboard for most made 3s](https://i.imgur.com/DXsSR0V.png), Curry ranks first, third, fourth, sixth, and ninth. That’s five of the top 10; nobody else has more than one such season that high.**

- **Curry’s individual statistics in those minutes (without KD and Klay) recall Harden’s stats from last season.** These two stat lines—on the left, Curry’s per-75-possession numbers without Durant and Thompson; on the right, Harden’s overall numbers in the 2018-19 regular season—are eerily similar, down to the exact same true shooting percentage. [TABLE](https://i.imgur.com/xUbyyPO.png)

- This season affords Curry a new opportunity to embrace the kind of individual basketball he has long skirted, which other contemporary stars have all adopted at one time or another. **Curry’s top usage season ranks just 74th all time**; this decade alone, Westbrook, Harden, DeMarcus Cousins, Kobe Bryant, Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade, DeMar DeRozan, Isaiah Thomas, Joel Embiid, Durant, and Devin Booker **have all dominated the ball more in at least one season than Curry ever has.**

- **In those 1,214 minutes with Curry but without Durant or Thompson over the last three seasons, the Warriors have still run their opponents off the floor.** On offense, they’ve scored 116.1 points per 100 possessions, a number that would lead the league every year.

We can revisit them after the season. I'll start it off:



2020 NBA Predictions
----


MVP - Joel Embiid 

 I think Philly runs away with East, voter fatigue on Giannis helps Embiid case

-----
ROTY - Ja Morant

 (if Zion injury persists, obviously he's the favorite)



---
COTY - Nick Nurse 

I like the Raptors to stay very competitive, Siakam is a stud and they have no weaknesses in their main rotation. Everyone can shoot and play defense, and they're an extremely unselfish team. kawhi leaving narrative helps)



---
DPOTY - Rudy Gobert 

Flat out most valuable defender in the league.  Jazz likely to have a great regular season



---
6MOTY - Harrell 

His production as a big will be more important than the scoring/playmaking punch Lou brings with PG, Kawhi added to roster. 


---
MIP - Adebayo

What are some good places that would make sense to make a move for Sabonis?

My most realistic option that I haven't seen really anyone talk about is the Memphis Grizzlies, and a deal centered around Jae Crowder. A 1-1 Sabonis-Crowder swap doesn't quite work, so the Pacers would have to throw in one or both of Alize Johnson or JaKeenan Grant, neither of which would be a hang up on a deal. 

Crowder gives the playoff-chasing Pacers another good wing who can shoot and defend, and a rebuilder like the Grizzlies has no use for him. He's also an expiring deal, so not a big commitment for Indiana. 

Sabonis, entering his age-23 season, adds another piece to the Grizzlies' young core. I don't think having Jonas Valanciunas stops the Grizzlies from making this deal. He has a movable contract at \~$15 million/season down the line when the Grizzlies decide to move on from him, as he doesn't fit the timeline of a young Grizzlies team at 27.

I would imagine Memphis would also need to include a pick in this deal. They have Utah's 1st rounder this season, which will be a later pick. They could also give up their own 1st rounder in 2021 or 2022.

I think a deal looks something like this:

MEM Recieves: D. Sabonis, J. Grant

IND Recieves: J. Crowder, UTA 2020 1st Round Pick

The emphasis on 3-point shooting, frequent switching on defense, and use of analytics to quantify/judge players all impact how teams play and how fans watch the game.

What players do you think would have been significantly more valued in today's modern game than they were when they played?

[**Brent Barry**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/barrybr01.html) is the player who made me think of this post. Barry was a good enough ballhander to play the point, and also had the size to guard 1-3. He also shot over 40 percent from long range, primarily as a SG. Barry shot above 80 percent from the free throw line as well, making him a very efficient offensive player overall.

[**Trent Tucker**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/tucketr01.html) and [**Allan Houston**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/houstal01.html) are players similar to Barry, but neither shot 3-pointers at the same rate that Barry did. Houston also had a hard time moving defensively after his knee injuries. At 6'3"" [**Terry Porter**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/portete01.html) primarily played PG, but also shot nearly 40 percent for his career from downtown and got to the line frequently.

Looking at some forwards, you could say that [**Sam Perkins**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/perkisa01.html) extended his career by developing a 3-point shot at age 32. While Sam was never really a focal point of his team's offense, this early ""stretch four"" forced opponents to extend defensive coverage. This created opportunities in the paint for teammates in Seattle (Gary Payton, Shawn Kemp, Detlef Schrempf) and Indiana (Rik Smits, Dale Davis, Antonio Davis).

[**Danny Ferry**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/f/ferryda01.html) also had multiple seasons where he shot nearly 40 percent from beyond the arc with over 200 attempts. Stretching the defense created opportunities for other excellent three-point shooters on those mid-90's Cleveland teams, like Mark Price, Chris Mills, Bobby Phills, etc.

It's a little tougher to gauge statistically how effective so-called defensive specialists would be in the modern game, but it's safe to say players like [**Sidney Moncrief**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/moncrsi01.html)**,** [**Joe Dumars,**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/dumarjo01.html) [**Michael Cooper**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/coopemi01.html)**,** and [**Dennis Johnson**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/johnsde01.html) could be even more valued today (even if they're a little on the shorter side). With a serviceable 3-point shot, any of those players could have had even more successful careers than they did, though all are obviously quite accomplished.

He won people some money last year on DFS and filled in long enough during the regular season to make a dent in the season for fantasy owners.  But some people held onto him too long.  Tyler Dorsey also comes to mind. He was cruising along in NBA nothingness for most of 18-19.  The year before he had a decent few weeks for Atlanta.  What led up to each of those weeks was nearly identical stat-wise to last season.  Then peak performance met dead eye with opportunity and Tyler dropped 29 on the Magic in Orlando.  Didn't believe it?  Ok,  so he drops 21 on OKC then double digits 6 of his last 7 games (kinda similar to the season prior).  If it were to do all over again could he repeat that stretch?  I'd give him a 50/50 chance.  But all that got him was a one way ticket to Tel Aviv.  Will he ever play in the NBA again?  I'm pulling for him, but it's a bit of a long shot.  Same as Rabb, although Ivan will get some looks.  His writing has been on the wall for a while now.  At least that's my initial impression.    

Both of these players are offensively capped at their present ability.  They each offer some athletic ability but their playing styles prohibit growth, even though they are both still fairly young.  It's more extreme for Rabb.  He's very well coached, just usually over matched from a physical standpoint.  He wouldn't be more effective with a reckless style but he might still be on an NBA roster somewhere.  Just look down the Memphis bench to find Bruno.  That guy gets welcomed with open arms at every stop - not bad for someone who plays soft and has had a half dozen decent games in his career.

It seems more like Tyler Dorsey plays like a guy from the University of Oregon.  Jordan Bell, Dillon Brooks, Chris Boucher, Troy Brown.  They all have a similar style.  Anyone who knows Dana Altman knows he is a coach big-big on fundamentals, especially from his guards.  That may be great for college ball.  But one draw back against all these guys is a lack of assertiveness from the offensive end.  At least that's been a criticism  - Brooks has a chance to change that this year.   I remember when Altman was coaching Kansas State and attended one of the Wildcat road game practices.  If you've been around basketball long you get to see the different coaching personalities during practice.  Some are the 'rah rah' types, some are the grandfather types, some are the 'always frustrated' types.  Altman was a screamer.  You could hear him yelling derogatory remarks at his team a hundred feet from the gym door.  It was that way the entire practice.  I'd guess that he's toned it down a few notches this day and age.  But he was definitely an authoritarian type figure at practices, at least in his early days.  Dorsey rarely breaks his mold on the floor.  In the right matchups you can get fairly close to predicting breakout games.  Same with Rabb.    It just makes you wonder sometimes whether some players get too inundated with similar (restrictive) coaching style all the way up until they get drafted.  Then their mind is just closed to doing something out of the mold.  The NBA style is so much different in that regard as adjustment to a new style is an immediate must.  

This wouldn't be the first time it took the amateur world a while to adjust to the NBA.  It took 20-25 years for the NBA to catch on to the 3 pointer. Lots of high schools and colleges weren't big on the 3 for a while and that just meant many players were being introduced to it as an integral offensive component at the NBA level.  So there was an adjustment period before the entire basketball world (high school to NBA) was working with somewhat similar offenses - and somewhat similar practices.  

Now the NBA is so much about timing these days.  Way more so than even a decade ago.  You see more jump passes in a normal NBA game than you'll see in a season out of most high school/ college teams.  These guys like Dorsey and Rabb were essentially coached into a corner at the amateur level.  Now they'll probably have to go abroad and reinvent themselves if they want another shot at the NBA.  Anyway, I could just be way off base on all this.  I was hoping to see both these guys in the NBA this year but that probably won't happen now.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,67942,public,self,Players getting 'over coached' before getting to the NBA... ?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/dke3l1/players_getting_over_coached_before_getting_to/,,,,,,,,,,,1572153228.0,,,,,

In 2019 James Harden made history by sinking 317 unassisted triples. However, his 3pt% for the season was 'only' 36.8 - good, but not the mark we would expect for one of the league's premier shooters.

This is because unassisted shots are, in general, more difficult than assisted ones.

From 2013, when the NBA started video tracking, players have made approximately 37% of catch-and-shoot 3pters, 3pters without dribbling, or 3pt shots within two seconds of touching the ball. These three overlapping categories make up the vast majority (over 90%) of assisted 3pters. All other 3pters were hit at \~30%.

# Method

This data is useful because, thanks to play-by-play data from basketball-reference, we know how many assisted/unassisted threes players made back to 2001. If we assume that they shot about 7% better when assisted, we can then estimate shot difficulty.

From here we can calculate 'shots made above average' - a concept similar to [Kirk Goldsberry's ShotScore](http://grantland.com/features/kirk-goldsberry-introduces-new-way-understand-nba-best-scorers/), which [I've explored earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/au81d0/kirk_goldsberrys_shotscore_20022013/). The idea is to see how many threes a player would have made compared to a league-average shooter taking the same number of assisted/unassisted shots.

Finally, I've added 'pure shooting percentage': an estimate of how they would shoot if they attempted unassisted 3s at a league-average rate.

# Discussion

* Not going to lie, I kinda expected Harden to top this year, but Curry's percentage gap was too much to overcome.
* Curry leads every season since he was drafted except 2012, where he played 25 games and finished 13th. He even managed to win last year in 50 games.
* Nash looks really good, as does Billups.
* Ray Allen was expected, as well as one good year for Redd.
* Kobe doesn't look great (bearing in mind that it's not a perfect measure of shot quality)
* LeBron hovers around average except his last couple of years in Miami

Here is a brief history that gives the bare essentials of the history of the NBA. If you want a more comprehensive one I recommend Basketball: A Love Story, either the documentary by Dan Klores or the book by the legend Jackie MacMullan and Rafe Bartholomew. [Here](https://www.theringer.com/the-bill-simmons-podcast/2019/7/25/20726685/nba-summer-mailbag-plus-kevin-costner-on-his-best-baseball-movies) is also a link to an 8 minute segment (25:00 - 33:15) on a Bill Simmons podcast episode in which he breaks down the major eras of the NBA. This post derives  the categorization of the eras from that segment, expands on each era Bill describes, and adds some tidbits that I felt were important. I touch a lot on issues of race in the NBA, especially in the early sections, because I believe it is one of the biggest influences on the development of the league.


Many people say that the first dynasty of the NBA was Russell’s Celtics, but in my opinion, the story of the NBA begins with the Minneapolis Lakers (now known as the Los Angeles Lakers). Led by the bespectacled George Mikan, the Lakers won 5 championships in 7 years. During this era, the vast majority of players were white – in fact, there was a de facto ban on black players back then. Interesting trivia fact: the first non-white player to play in the NBA was actually Japanese-American Wataru ""Wat"" Misaka, who scored 7 career points. Since today’s NBA is a predominantly black league, it is important to note that Nat “Sweetwater” Clifton, Chuck Cooper, and Earl Lloyd became the first three black players in the NBA in 1950. 



The lifting of the de facto ban on black players in the NBA caused a major influx of talented players in the 1950s and 1960s, chief among them Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain. The contrast between their respective careers, accolades, and legacies would spark two timeless debate topics among NBA fans: the importance of individual vs. team success when evaluating a player, and of course, the title of Greatest Of All Time (GOAT). Jerry West introduced a third timeless NBA theme – the tragic hero that had the misfortune of being born at the time of another, greater dynasty. Together, the three would establish the NBA’s status as one of the four major team sports in America.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,67884,public,self,"History of the NBA, Part 1",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/dk0v8q/history_of_the_nba_part_1/,,,,,,,,,,,1572140662.0,,,,,

In all likelihood even during the regular season your team is never going more than 9 players deep into their rotation, and the rotation will shrink to 7 or 8 players in the playoffs with the starters playing close to 40 MPG if not more, so having decent players on your bench who never play is a waste in my opinion.

I get injuries happen, but if your star player goes down odds are you weren't going to do much once that happened anyway.

I'm having trouble deciding which middle class teams are gonna barely miss the playoffs. Injuries are likely going to make the difference, but it's pretty hard to predict such things.

Anyways, some of these predictions could look stupid by springtime. I've flip-flopped on several teams recently. The West is ridiculously stacked, and there are several playoff-worthy teams that will miss by a lot, including my Pelicans and Thunder predictions at 11 and 12. I even feel bad leaving the Spurs out of the top 8 since they've defied the odds so many times in the past.

In the East, I'm really big on the Hawks and Bulls, but I don't feel right leaving the Heat, Magic or Celtics out. Even without KD, I think the Nets could make a jump. The Raptors still have a good mix of veterans and young talent, but we still have question marks.

So many teams look better on paper this year. This has been one of the more challenging rankings with so much parity and no more clear superteams.

Giannis's lack of a reliable jumpshot really isn't as damning as the Toronto series made it seem, IMO.

First of all, almost all the teams in the league simply do not have the personnel to guard him. The Celtics (traditionally a very good defensive team, 7th in the league in defensive rating, with Horford, Baynes, and several plus defensive wings) seemed to have figured it out for one game before Giannis proceeded to figure *them* out and averaged 30/12/6/1.8/1.8 on 67TS% in the next 4 games to eliminate them. Most teams aren't even as good defensively as the Celtics were, let alone good enough to limit Giannis's impact in any meaningful way.

Second of all, the Toronto Raptors were one of the best playoff defenses ever. This is not an exaggeration -  [the Raptors were 2nd all-time (since 1974) in holding opponent-teams below their regular season offensive-rating, behind only the legendary 2004 Detroit Pistons](https://i.imgur.com/3LPH0UU.png), per Ben Taylor. They featured two former DPOYs and multiple other All-Defense-level players littered over their roster, they were smart, long, and strong enough (particularly Siakam, Gasol, and Leonard) to swarm Giannis every time he stepped into the paint, cheating off of Eric Bledsoe. Just about every other team in the league simply aren't prepared to contain Giannis the way Raptors did, with the exception of perhaps the mega-sized 76ers starting unit this upcoming season (and even then, that's no sure thing). 

Third of all, even if his offensive impact is limited, Giannis has a very good argument for the best *defensive* player in the league. The Bucks were the no 1 regular season defense, and, along with the Raptors, were also historically good in the playoffs, largely due to the Greek Freak's efforts - Giannis was a nightmare on switches and was absolutely everywhere in the paint, making life very difficult for opposing wings and protecting the rim like an elite big - he averaged 1.1 steals and 2.0 blocks in the playoffs. He's capable of impacting the game in a huge way with just his defense alone.

Of course, we have to acknowledge his weaknesses - a below-average jumpshot, his FT% tanking in the Raptors series (58.3% is atrocious, especially considering how many FTs he takes), his passing game (other than his kickouts) can be fairly spotty at times, missing easy interior dropoffs from time to time, his fairly limited (albeit effective) post game. However, he's going to be a perennial MVP candidate from now on with possibly 8+ years of elite play ahead of him, and he's only getting better from here. Which, think about it - he just authored one of the better regular seasons in NBA history, and still is nowhere near his ceiling. He's *already* elite, though, is my point, and very very very few teams have an answer for what he brings to the table.",False,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,67796,public,self,A defense of Giannis Antetokounmpo,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/djcr6q/a_defense_of_giannis_antetokounmpo/,,,,,,,,,,,1572117631.0,,,,,

He averaged 28.0 points per game (4+ more than his previous career high) and played DPOY-caliber defense on the other end. By all reasonable standards, he was a true ""MVP candidate.""

Kind of. While George did finish 3rd overall in the voting tally, he didn't garner a single first-place vote. 78 for Giannis, 23 for Harden, 0 for George. So, sure, in theory, he was a ""finalist"" for MVP, but he wasn't actually a serious threat to *win* the trophy last season over those other two superstars. He was an MVP candidate in the same sense that Amy Klobuchar is a presidential candidate this year. They're in the discussion -- they're on the podium -- but they're unlikely to actually win.

If we use that standard of candidate (a player who is a viable threat to win *first-place* votes), then the bar rises significantly. In fact, it may only be a handful of names. Let's go through some of those now, and rank the 3 candidates that appear ahead of the pack to me.

######**theoretically possible, but would need some narrative**

**PG Kyrie Irving, Brooklyn**

Kyrie Irving (and Donovan Mitchell and a healthy Victor Oladipo) are great examples of players who get floated out as potential MVP candidates during the pre-season by people who want to find darkhorses and sleepers. And there's some logic there. After all, Kyrie Irving will be in a great situation to pump in points for Brooklyn. He may even lead them to a top 4-5 seed in the process.

I wouldn't discount Irving having a great year, but league *MVP* is simply a higher bar than he's proven capable of reaching so far (now at age 26.) If you cherry pick his career highs in different categories, he'd average 25.2 points and 6.9 assists a game. Great numbers. Possibly good enough to be 2nd team All-NBA numbers. But MVP? Not really that close. Consider this: over the last three seasons, James Harden has averaged 31.8 points and 9.2 assists per game. Maybe Kyrie Irving ups his numbers to 27-8 range, but he's still not getting high enough to match the elite marks of the modern era.

If we're looking for a realistic path to MVP for Irving, it may come from unexpected team success. If the Nets can somehow get up to the 2-3 seed range, I can see him mustering up votes and potentially finishing in the top 3. Still, I don't see him *winning* as a particularly likely scenario.

**C Joel Embiid, Philadelphia**

Based on pure stats, Joel Embiid isn't too far removed from MVP status. Last season, he averaged 27.5 points, 13.6 rebounds, and 3.7 assists a game to go along with top-notch defense.

To his credit, he also notched a career high in ""games."" The problem...? That number was only 64. If he's actually going to win MVP, Embiid will have to at least crack the 70 games mark. And given the Sixers' situation (a likely top 2 seed in the soft Eastern Conference), they don't really need to push the pedal to the medal like that. They'd be smarter to manage Embiid's minutes and health to make sure he's 100% by the time the playoffs start.

To be fair, we can't deny that there is a *potential* lane for his MVP. Like Irving, it would have to come with a lot of team success. The Sixers would need to grab the # 1 seed out East, with 60+ wins, and with Embiid being the centerpiece for a dominant defense. Again, possible. Likely? Not really. Last season, the Sixers' finished 15th in defense and won 51 games (with an expected win total of 48.) 

**C Nikola Jokic, Denver**

It's been a banner years for Jokers in the NBA standings and at the movie box office, but it's hard to bet on a scenario where that culminates in MVP honors. Like Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic is more likely fighting for 1st team All-NBA than actual MVP.

Statistically, he's close to being a legitimate MVP, registering 20.1 points, 10.8 rebounds, and a stellar 7.3 assists last season (in only 31 minutes a game.) Still, those aren't quite MVP-numbers in the modern NBA. To actually grab the trophy, Jokic would need to ride a considerable amount of narrative wave. The most likely way to do that, of course, is a massive amount of team success. The Nuggets would need to grab the # 1 seed out West, and allow Jokic to garner the credit for that with the media.

How likely is it that the Denver Nuggets finish with the # 1 seed? It's not terribly far-fetched. After all, they finished at # 2 last season with 54 wins. Their ""expected"" win total (based on advanced stats and point differential and such) only graded them at 51-31, but it's possible they get up to the 55 range based on natural improvement from their young bucks. And it's possible that's good enough to grab the 1 seed. That said, the West is going to be a fire fight, with Houston, Utah, and both L.A. teams in contention for that top spot. And if it's *close* (say a few wins difference), that still may not be enough for Jokic to win out over players with gaudier stats below him.

######**possible, but would need an (un)lucky break**

**SF LeBron James and PF Anthony Davis, L.A. Lakers**

When Kevin Durant joined the Golden State Warriors, he took an ""easy road"" to the NBA title. That said, he probably guaranteed himself that he wouldn't be winning an MVP during his time there. In many ways, Durant and Steph Curry would ""cancel each other out"" and make it hard for either of them to win over the other. Remember, the only year that Durant won MVP in Oklahoma City was back when Russell Westbrook missed extended time.

It's likely that the same situation applies here in L.A. with LeBron James and Anthony Davis. On paper, they should be MVP candidates. They're top 5 players (when healthy) on what should be a top 5 team. I can see LeBron James riding his ""point guard LeBron!"" narrative into 9+ assists a game, and earning a lot of buzz for that. Alternatively, Anthony Davis could put up his usual beastly numbers (28-12 with great defensive stats) and finally earn the spotlight that's alluded him in New Orleans. But like KD and Curry, it's going to be hard for one of these superstars to make an MVP case over the other.

Unless... an ""unlucky"" break occurs. That is: injury. If either LeBron or AD misses extended time (15-20+ games), that should be a boon to the candidacy of the other player. Both stars are more than capable racking up gaudy numbers when playing together, but they may put up ungodly numbers on their own.

**SF Kawhi Leonard, L.A. Clippers**

Of all our candidates or fringe candidates, Kawhi Leonard is the one that I expect to receive the most flak about (not ranking in the top 3.) After all, this is a player that many here on /NBA consider the best player on the planet. This is a player who will anchor the team considered most likely to win the title. And this is a player who has finished as high as # 2 (in 2015-16) and # 3 (in 2016-17) in MVP voting before. It's easy to see a scenario where he upgrades from silver and bronze to gold.

That said, there are a few factors working against him. For one, those top 3 finishes came pre-Zaza and back when Leonard was locked in on both ends every night. Based on what we saw last season, his night-to-night intensity (especially on defense) had taken a step back. He also played a modest 60 games thanks to load management, a number not far removed from his career average (in total, he's averaged 62 / 82 games per regular season.) He may only be 28 years old, but his body has more wear and tear than that age may indicate.

Here's where the ""lucky""/""unlucky"" break would have to come in for him to win MVP. For starters, Kawhi Leonard would obviously need to stay healthy for at least 70-75 games. And alternatively, new teammate Paul George would probably have to miss even more time than expected. If PG13 isn't around, Leonard's numbers will look better, and his impact on the Clippers will look more pronounced. In *that* case, he'd be given the lion's share of the credit for their team success. The idea of the Clippers winning the # 1 seed isn't far-fetched at all, so it's quite possible that Leonard will ride that momentum to MVP. Still, there's a lot of factors that would need to go in his favor for this to happen, which is why I don't consider him a top 3 candidate overall. 

######**more than possible. our most likely MVP winners**

**(3) SG James Harden, Houston**

As mentioned before, James Harden has averaged 31.8 points and 9.2 assists per game over the past three seasons. In that time, the Houston Rockets have averaged 57.7 wins. It's a historic stretch on par with the greatest offensive players of all-time. Given that, it's a surprise that Harden has only won the MVP one time (although he has 3 runner-up finishes in his career.)

What's more terrifying from the league perspective is that Harden isn't slowing down; arguably, he's getting better. He's launching *more* threes (going from 8.0 to 9.3 to 10.0 to 13.2 per game) and consequently ballooned up to 36.1 points per game last season. And as we know, he does that with stellar efficiency (over 61% true shooting over each of the last three years.) James Harden and Daryl Morey are on the right side of history here with their advanced stats and analytics; as time goes on, more and more writers will embrace those numbers as well. In fact, voters have already been made to look foolish for under-appreciating Harden in the past.

With Russell Westbrook coming over in place of Chris Paul, Harden's raw numbers may take a step back to some extent. After all, Westbrook is a high-usage player who plays a lot more often than CP3 did. But still, if Harden needs to take a step back, then there's still a LOT of wiggle room here. Consider this: if Harden scores 400 less points this season in the same amount of games, he'd *still* average 31.0 points per game.

In terms of ""narrative"" and ""fresh storylines,"" Harden has some hurdles to overcome. Houston grabbing the # 1 seed again would help quite a bit. But the Rockets should still win 50-55 games fairly easily; Harden should still average close to 30-8 fairly easily. He's proven, consistent, and durable. Essentially, Harden is the ""bar"" that all other MVP candidates need to be measured against, and he's the reason it's so hard to leap past him into credible contender status.

**(2) PF Giannis Antetoukounmpo, Milwaukee**

The recipe for Giannis Antetoukounmpo to repeat as MVP is simple. Just repeat what you did last year. If he can match the same production (27.7 PPG, 12.5 rebounds, 5.9 assists, strong defense) along with the # 1 seed on Milwaukee, he'll be in the catbird seat once again. Hell, even if Giannis and the Bucks take a slight step back (let's say 26-10-5 with 55 wins) that still may be enough to get the job done. Like a transcendent political candidate, he brings in multiple camps to the tent: those who love advanced stats, and those traditionalists who want ""wins!"" 

There's a perception that Antetoukounmpo is hurt by the fact that he won last year, and that the media craves new storylines and narratives. That's true -- to some extent -- but not wholly true. Since 2001, the newly crowned MVP has repeated 5 separate times (Tim Duncan, Steve Nash, LeBron James, LeBron again after a Derrick Rose intermission, and Steph Curry.) That's not far removed from the times the MVP has *not* repeated (7).

The reason that I'd rank Antetoukounmpo slightly higher than Harden is because the Bucks should have a cleaner lane to the # 1 seed. But clearly, the two of them are true forces who will be tough candidates to beat for the MVP presuming they stay healthy.

**(1) PG Steph Curry, Golden State**

There's very little ""projection"" involved with Giannis Antetoukounmpo winning MVP -- just do what you did last year. Similarly, Steph Curry has already proven he has the goods and the formula to do this; he did it twice before. All he needs to do is repeat his success from a few seasons ago.

In fact, there's a chance that Curry could have his BEST season statistically. Consider this: the last time we saw peak Steph Curry (prior to Kevin Durant), he scored 30.1 points per game and launched 11.2 threes per game (making 45.4%). I wouldn't necessarily say that Curry took a backseat to Durant over the last three years, but he at least took turns driving the bus. With KD gone and Klay Thompson injured, Curry will be getting all the work that he can handle. If Curry ups his three-point bombs in the same fashion that James Harden has done in the last few years (remember, going from 8.0 to 13.2) then what will that look like? Will Curry launch 14-15 threes a game? If he does, the records and MVP buzz will surely follow. Game to game and shot to shot, he can be even more of a cheat code than James Harden himself. 

That said, the most underrated element of James Harden's game is his durability; the dude is a steel robot who can play 35 minutes a game for 80 games a year. Can Steph Curry do the same? At this stage of his career? TBD. That's the biggest hurdle that Curry will need to overcome to win MVP again, now at age 31.

But the reason I'd rank Curry as the # 1 most likely MVP (over Harden and Giannis) is because he doesn't necessarily need the top seed in the West to earn the trophy. The expectations aren't terribly high for the Golden State Warriors this year (over/under is less than 50.) So if Curry can crack 50+ wins and lead the Warriors to a top 4 seed, that should be enough to rev up the campaign bus again.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,67793,public,self,"The field of true ""MVP candidates"" is narrower than we think.

Here's the math as far as I understand it:

The NBA salary cap is 51.2% of the NBA BRI (basketball related income).

This year it is 109.14 million per team.
So to increase that 100% I divided by 0.512.
Then to account for the total of all the teams I multiplied by 30.

That means this salary cap assumes an NBA BRI of $6,394,921,875.

Now China accounts for about 500 million of the BRI.

So let's say in an unrealistic fallout scenario, China completely pulls out of the NBA, they lose all of that revenue. 

So let's do the math and subtract 500 million from the NBA BRI. 

6394921875 - 500,000,000 = 5,894,921,875

Next let's find out the new salary cap based on this.

51.2% of $5,894,921,875 divided by 30.

So the new salary cap would be about $100 million.

That's a loss of around 9 million per team that can be given to 15 players.  

So every NBA player would lose on average $600,000 per year if China completely pulled out of the NBA. 

And before you say it's not that much, keep in mind that the average NBA players earns just over 3 million a year. 

And for the players such as Lebron who make much more than 3 million, well he also would stand to lose a significant amount of money in Chinese endorsements. 

The people not affected by either the salary cap, or endorsements in the NBA would be coaches, GMs, and others of that sort. 

Hmmm

Anyway, I fully support Hong Kong, and I would love to say that I'd voice my opinion on it even if I was in the NBA. But looking at the numbers makes it a little trickier. It's not just that you might be willing to give up some of your paycheque to support human rights around the world. But just by saying anything you're asking every other NBA player to give up some of their paycheque too, and without even asking for their permission.

The Miami Heat line, according to oddsshark and most other websites sits at \[43.5\])[https://www.oddsshark.com/nba/nba-season-win-totals-betting-odds](https://www.oddsshark.com/nba/nba-season-win-totals-betting-odds)), and based on my own observation from frequently browsing [r/nba](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/) most people would consider us to range from 40-42 wins. Some even questioning if we are a playoff team. I’m going to preface this by saying that I don’t mean to sound hostile or condescending, but this take is laughable and shows how many people haven’t paid any attention to anything other than our record from last year. I don’t expect anyone outside of Heat fans that have watched us the past few seasons to really understand anything at all about this team, because this is not your typical fringe playoff team. So I hope this post will clear the air, and bring the light on some of the misconceptions about the potential of this team. This won’t be super analytical, but it will be long.

\# The Heats 2018-2019 season is not an accurate reflection of what the team really is

People look at the 39-43 record from last year’s campaign and try to apply that to next season. The truth is that that record was influenced by a lot factors that have either gone away or mended themselves. In fact 39 wins is pretty amazing all things considered.

1. Goran Dragic only played 36 games last year, all of those either injured or recovering. Having Dragic healthy, which he is now, would have probably led to 2 or 3 more wins.

2. One of the worst takes regarding our team that I have seen mentioned somewhat frequently is that we got worse because Wade left. Wade deserves everything in the world and I’m not saying I’m mad because of last season, but Wade lost us so many games. If any game was close going into the 4th quarter we let Wade play hero ball (deservedly so) and shot us out of most games. Wade was not a positive on the court in most games, and him retiring is our 2nd biggest example of addition by subtraction.

3. Our biggest example of addition by subtraction is dropping Hassan Whiteside. Not much to be said about him here, because his problems are well documented [r/nba](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/). One thing I do want to clear up though is that he did not quit after getting his contract. In fact he had his best season the year after getting his contract, along with massively improving his defense. It wasn’t about the money, it’s just his fragile ego, attitude, and archaic style of play became a bigger and bigger problem.

4. The Heat finished \[dead last\]([https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/stat/free-throw-pct](https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/stat/free-throw-pct)) in free throw percentage last year, mainly due to a career low from Whiteside who dropped from a 70% ft shooter to a 44% ft shooter last season. This cost us a lot of games obviously, but with our roster changes we have shot \[extremely better\]([https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/preseason/team/Miami-Heat/15/stats/2020/Totals/All/points/All/desc/1/Preseason](https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/preseason/team/Miami-Heat/15/stats/2020/Totals/All/points/All/desc/1/Preseason)) although it is a small sample size.

\# Some surprising facts that separate the Heat from other Eastern Conference teams in their range.

Miami had the \[12th\]([https://www.basketballreference.com/leagues/NBA\_2019\_standings.html](https://www.basketballreference.com/leagues/NBA_2019_standings.html)) best road record in the league. Better than the Pacers or Nets. In fact they tied with the Philadelphia 76s and the Denver Nuggets. Furthering the point, there was only a 1 game difference from the Boston Celtics, Utah Jazz, and Portland Trailblazers. And only a 2 game difference from the LA Clippers, Houston Rockets, and OKC. Only Toronto, Golden State and Bucks had a bigger difference. At the same time we also had the 24th worst home record, up there among some of the worst teams in the NBA. My theory is that we let Wade play more at home for the fans, therefore losing us way more home games. Let’s compare that to other Eastern Conference teams that finished in the same range as the Heat. The Nets and Pacers finished 19-22, the Magic 17-24, the Pistons 15-26, and the Hornets at 14-27. What’s even crazier is that the Heat had the best road record among teams that won 40-49 games, with the only exception the Clippers and Thunder. Pretty good for a 39 win team. The point here is that our road record is more indicative of how good the Miami Heat are, because Wade wasn’t that much of an issue.

This is the craziest stat in my opinion. The Miami Heat also had the 12th best record against the West. That not might sound that amazing until you realize that is also counting Western team’s record against other Western teams. The Miami Heat had the 4th best record in the East Conference when playing against the West, trailing only the Raptors, Bucks, and Sixers. The Miami Heat record against the west at 16-14 blows out any other team that finished within our range. The only teams that were close were the Pacers at 15-15, and the Celtics and Pistons tied at 14-16. The Magic finished 12-18, the Nets finished 13-17 and the Hornets finished 10-20. Again this points to Wade’s negative impact on away games, and our excellent coaching staff.

\# We have only seen this team be somewhat healthy twice

In 2016-2017 we went 25-6, with a 13 game winning streak after a putrid 11-30 start. And in 2017-2018 we won 44 games, although we suffered injuries near the end of the season. I don’t know where to find the stat, but the Heat were among the top of the league in games missed due to injury last season.

\# Our strong bench just got stronger

I don't know where to find our bench stats, but our bench was extremely valuable last year, usually killing other teams second units. This was without Dion and Dragic. This season our starting lineup will most likely be Winslow/Herro or Dion/Butler/Bam/ Meyers. That means we have a bench unit consisting of Dragic/Dion or Herro/James Johnson/Derrick Jones J[r/Kelly](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kelly/) Olynyk (at least until he fully heals). In terms of second units that is elite offensively as well as above average defensively, our main strengths last year was depth and we got deeper.

\# Development of Youth

Another really underrated and misunderstood player is Winslow, who took a massive leap and was our best player last season after Dragic opted for knee surgery. I won’t go over him because that in of its self could be a whole post. Bam is also set for a big leap, with Whiteside out of the way he can finally play unimpeded. Tyler Herro looks like the 2nd best player out of the draft when looking at Summer League and the Preseason, but I’m not going to overreact. At the very least he will be a good spot up shooter and floor spacer for the team. Another player who has emerged as a great role player is Derrick Jones Jr, mostly known for his dunks but also plays great defense and is very skilled offensive rebounder due to his athleticism. He is only 21, and while no one expects him to be star he is shaping up to be a top tier role-player that can energize the team with a highlight play.

\# The Final and Most Important Point.

In addition to all the other points I made we added fucking Jimmy Butler, a top 12-15 player to an already elite top 6 defense but terrible offensive team. Our biggest problem was scoring, and we dropped Whiteside and Wade and added Jimmy and Herro, with Dragic and Dion coming back. We didn’t even lose anything since he was basically traded straight up for Josh Richardson. Saying we are barely a playoff team or only marginally better than last season is incredibly wrong. Again I don’t want to sound like a homer that shits on other teams (which is unavoidable with this ending rant) but thinking the Pistons or Magic are better, despite only winning a few more games than us last season, despite not making any significant roster changes is just ignorant.

TL;DR

The Heat are way better than you think. We have elite a elite road record and record against the west. Outside of Orlando no other team that finished in our range doesn't have the kind of developing young core that we have. We added Jimmy Butler on top of all that",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,67760,public,self,The Miami Heats over/under will be easy money: Why the Heat are more underrated and misunderstood than you think.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/diy0hh/the_miami_heats_overunder_will_be_easy_money_why/,,,,,,,,,,,1572103821.0,,,,,

Yada yada yada. Whatever I have to say so the good citizens of Reddit wouldn't think of me as ""amoral"" or ""immoral"" for deviating from Reddit's consensus of the wise.

[During the meeting, sources said, several prominent players voiced frustration about their perception that they were being put in the middle of the dispute between the NBA and China, and they said they were unhappy about being asked by local Chinese reporters to address the situation....Silver was asked whether anything would happen to Morey, as several players said that they believed if a player cost the NBA millions of dollars because of a tweet, there would be repercussions.](https://africa.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27847951/daryl-morey-was-misinformed-sending-tweet-china-hong-kong)

**1)** But even without the linked ESPN article as a source, you need not be a psychic to divine that NBA players (including Harden &amp; Westbrook) would be disgruntled (euphemistically) that a suit-and-tie fatcat just airdropped the entire NBA ecosystem on the verge of, in the words of Prop Joe, a Chinese cemetery.

And for what? A smattering of sweet, sweet ""social justice"" brownie points meted out thru Twitter, all for a tweet he eventually disavowed? Let's be real, no NBA player *truly* cares about HK one way or the other. If their agent calls them up to alert them that Morey's piping up cost the NBA (&amp; in turn them) $millions over what seems (to them) like a BS non-issue, they'd be livid.

If I were the Rockets I'd actually be worried if Morey's still the GM during free-agency 2020 or 2021 or whatever. Some players' irritation at Morey might be strong enough to walk away from the Rockets *just because he's the GM*. Reddit would be in disbelief (""how can they fault Morey for 'merely' doing 'the right thing?'""),

* Reddit: ""No, Morey sought to build awareness, &amp; he succeeded. Ever heard of the Streisand effect?!""

**2)** Putting aside the weak fallback to something that always counts as a ""win"" (""just building awareness for a much-needed 'dialogue,' bro""), what's been ""Streisand'ed"" is *emphatically not* the underlying situation in HK that Morey wanted to throw his hat in. In every statement by any NBA personality (Fertitta, Silver, LeBron, etc.) since Morey's tweet, *not once* do they so much as mention ""Hong Kong"" or any events therein. Instead, everybody's been slapping mud at everyone else's second-order &amp; third-order reactions (""Did Tencent overreact? Did the NBA capitulate to Tencent's overreation?).

It's following a similar dynamic to the NFL anthem protests: everyone got into such a huff over how unpatriotic the players were for kneeling that they either forgot or ignored the underlying policing issues that prompted the kneeling in the first place. If anything, to the extent anyone reflected simultaneously on both the propriety of kneeling AND the cause of the kneeling, their distaste for kneeling during the anthem spilled over into a disinclination to hear, let alone support the NFL players' message.

Ditto here. Now you may say ""fuck em, if that's what they take from this then they're authoritarian fascists, &amp; who cares what they think?"" But if so, then you're admitting the ""dialogue"" isn't topsy-turvying in the direction you would've liked or envisioned, since it takes two parties to hold a dialogue. In the HK context, the only thought anyone involved has devoted more than 2 seconds to is damage control with an eye toward the bottom line. Protestors getting tear-gassed or shot is just background noise.

* Reddit: ""Yea yea whatever, we know they're IMMORAL greedy capitalists. That's why we're behind Morey, a true hero.""

**3)** Speaking of Morey, where has he been during all this? Why aren't the reporters hounding LeBron 5 times a day trying to followup with the genesis of all this, Morey the archangel? If, as Reddit likes to parrot, ""some things are just bigger than basketball. Standing up for 'human rights' is always worth it,"" then why did Morey bother deleting his tweet, apologizing, &amp; retreating into a cave like a recluse? To save his job w/ Fertitta? But I thought ""'human rights' are more important than any job""? If Morey genuinely cared about how dire the situation in HK is, why isn't he resigning from a mere GM position to head over there?

Instead, when it came time to put up or shut up, Morey shut up faster &amp; for longer than anyone else in the NBA. I've eschewed the tinged phrase ""virtue-signaling"" until now, but he's a textbook example of it. No less an icon than Max Kellerman himself (Reddit's titan of conscience (*du jour*)) just remarked that ""it's easy to take a stand when it costs nothing."" When he thought he was just making another worthless tweet that'll cost him nothing, he spit out the tweet in all of 10 seconds. But when the tidal wave gazed back, his knees buckled. Yet he's the Rosa Parks in all of this?

***In case I've been too subtle throughout***: just how delusional is Reddit? Do the champions of all that is right (from the comfort of their couches) here really think LeBron will soon (or ever) regret tripling down on his disapprobation of Morey?

Just how well does Reddit expect NBA fanbases (i.e., ordinary Americans) to receive its plans to choreograph demonstrations in support of HK/Morey?

**Newsflash:** 99%+ of the NBA's audience in the US DGAF about any of this. They just want to watch good basketball. A ticket-paying fan will tolerate a loud neighbor heckling the other team, because that's all part of the game. But how many chants of ""Stand with Hong Kong/Morey"" do you expect to get in before they promptly warn you to STFU, to stop obstructing their view of the court, &amp; disrupting enjoyment of the game before security tosses you like they did Oakley?

In fact, I'd wager dollars to donuts that ""Free Taco Tuesdays if we hold the visitors below 100"" outpolls ""Stand with 'human rights' \[on the other side of the globe\]"" 99% to 1%. It'd be easy to empirically test this too: if some ""fans"" attempt a show of bravery, the PA announcer can easily broadcast over them ""Free Tacos everyone!""

At last I welcome the torrent of downvotes that will ""conclusively"" DEMOLISH my assessments.

First off I think the American media and government both need to mind their own damn business. Most Americans probably can’t even point HK out on a map, let alone understand what is going on. I’m a firm believer that as humans we have a moral obligation to step in for humanitarian issues around the globe. However Hong Kong is not facing “human rights violations” and is not one of those cases, even if western media tries to portray it as such. The HK civil unrests is a purely internal Chinese affair. 

For those unfamiliar, Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China, where they have their own laws that give them more freedom compared to the rest of the country. It IS NOT and never was its own country. Hong Kong for 100 years up until 1997 was a British colony, following an agreement from the Opium wars. During that time, and after, Hong Kong became the financial capital of Asia, consistently ranking higher than even the US on freedom indexes, financial stability, economic competitiveness, etc (according to Bloomberg, Forbes, Economist). Because of the British rule, Hong Kong served as an enclave of Western capitalism in what was at the time, still a closed off China. Hong Kong then became the sole funnel for outside ideas and capital to flow into China, allowing them to prosper massively. 

The unrest broke out over a proposed extradition bill earlier this year. A man killed his girlfriend in Taiwan and ran to hide in Hong Kong, so the bill was introduced as a way to stop criminals playing the system. Massive protests began since locals viewed the bill as setting a precedent for gradual erosion of HK’s special status. The bill has been withdrawn and yet riots are STILL going on, entering week 20 I believe. 

However my opinion, shared by many others as well is that this extradition bill was just the final straw as an excuse to protest. Deeply rooted anger and resentment towards mainland people and the government had already been brewing for years. In 1993, HK alone represented 33% of Chinese GDP, but today only around 2%. The rise of mainland cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen has gradually caused HK to fall behind in terms of development, but it has still stayed massively expensive to live in. The most notable issues for average HKers are severely unaffordable housing, and mainlanders poaching high pay jobs, and driving up inflation (luxury goods, milk powder, rents, etc), hence the xenophobia towards Mandarin speakers. 

Please note, I still don’t see how any of these are human rights issues as US media tries to portray it. These are economic issues that any society can have. So Americans that keep saying “free Hong Kong, don’t let the CCP take their human rights” are just plain wrong. This is not Yemen, or even Xinjiang. Also while there is no way for me to quantify it, I’d say the anti government demonstrators aren’t even the majority. There are equally as many people who want the unrest to stop.

I follow every major American news outlet from CNN to the WSJ and the material they all write disgusts me, it is all biased and misleading beyond belief. The people shown on the front pages are scumbag rioters, criminals and need to be labeled as such, instead of “peaceful protestors”. These people are literally tearing our own city apart. They destroy subway stations and set them on fire, they throw things on the train tracks, but then cry when obviously the subway shuts down to repair and prevent further damage. These scumbags attack police (sometimes in gangs, with sticks, bricks, molotovs, they even slashed a cop’s throat), destroy businesses, block traffic, block the airport, vandalise streets and government buildings, etc. Needless to say, the only people they are hurting are their OWN FELLOW HKers. And the worst part? All their messes are left behind for 70 year old ladies in the streets to clean up. Look up any non US news source such as South China Morning Post, Caixin Global, let alone an actual Mainland China newspaper, and you will see all the things I listed to be true, and picture/ video documented. 

The extradition bill was withdrawn a long time ago, but now these rioters (predominantly college aged) want an investigation into “police brutality”. Even though any police violence only came in response to being attacked. 

So when Daryl Morey says “Stand with Hong Kong”, he doesn’t know WTF he’s talking about. I don’t care if he went to MIT. Whether or not he realizes it, he’s indirectly using his considerable platform to advocate for scum to riot, tear Hong Kong apart, and cost the city billions of dollars. LeBron is 100% correct when he says Daryl Morey’s statement is misinformed, and didn’t consider any ramifications, yet LBJ is getting a rash of shit for it. 

All the whores at ESPN keep saying “LeBron wants money over human rights in China”. SHUT UP, none of you know what you’re talking about. LBJ 100% said the right thing, since this is CHINESE POLITICS. Most people in the NBA aren’t knowledgable to talk about it, but more than that, it’s none of their business. Daryl Morey tweeting and indirectly advocating for more riots in HK will lead to Chinese tax dollars being spent and Chinese lives being put in danger. That is why the HK situation is different from Donald Sterling, or the ASG arena bathrooms, and why the US should just stay out of it. 

Nobody’s human rights are being violated in Hong Kong, people are just mad at the economic situation. And as for 1.4 billion mainland Chinese?

Beal fits the Sixers defensive style perfectly and the Sixers might even need someone to guard smaller players. He could play a bit of the iso Butler role from last season late in games. He's also a good 3 point shooter to play alongside Simmons and Embiid.

Tobias Harris has a bunch of years left on his deal for the Wizards. He's a great offensive player - and if Wall can look alright he'll fit next to him well.

Stats that measure a player's contribution are as good as their ability to predict that player's influence on winning. For more specific stats like say, assists and ppg, they're as good as their ability to predict a player's influence on a team's offense. And this should be consistent over a large sample size. So good stats can

A.predict team success with decent accuracy over a large sample of time

B. predict team success as teams change(because remember, they're being used to measure players,not teams)

An example:

\-&gt; # of Assists have low correlation with offensive rating

\-&gt; Box creation has a higher correlation with offensive rating

Should you be using

a. Box creation

b. assists

Given the point of counting both is to measure how someone's table setting influences a team's offense, logically you should choose the latter. And if we break down the stats it's obvious why. 

1. Assists treat all 'assists"" as equally valuable, even though Magic Johnson sniping it for a layup past two defenders is way more valuable than Durant giving a simple pass to Draymond after Curry and Klay have drawn away defenders. Box creation offers weight based on the value of the pass(layup passes are&gt;&gt;everything else).
2. Assists only measure passes. When a primary scorer has two defenders move to cover them, and the play is exeucted using the space those two defenders left, the assist is not as valuable as the scorer's threat. Box creation using OC which looks play by play at who is creating the oppurtunities.

It was a surprise enough to see the Lakers pull off trading for Anthony Davis after the 3 week debacle that was the trade deadline, but it could be huge to see Chris Paul in a Lakers uniform.

Then again, it could be a disaster.

During this last summer, Chris Paul was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Russell Westbrook, a player who has one of the few contracts that can solely make up for the enormous 40 million contract player that is Chris Paul.

The Oklahoma City Thunder got Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, multiple 1st round picks, and as well Danillo Gallinari.

It is however the recurring narrative for the Thunder in the NBA media headlining, ""What are the Oklahoma City Thunder going to do with Chris Paul?""

Although Chris Paul had been rumored to possibly be a Laker again last year, the possibility of it actually happening seemed nearly impossible, especially barring that the Houston Rockets were looking for pieces to contend for a championship then.

After Chris Paul got traded and with the Lakers adding quality role players this year, Chris Paul becoming a Laker might not be so farfetched as it once seemed to be.

The real question is what will the Lakers give up in return and will it be worth taking on Chris Paul who has had a very poor health history in the NBA recently, with constant injuries year after year.

The story line about this situation now is that what's best for both Chris Paul and the Oklahoma City Thunder is a trade to another team. The biggest supporting chip and trade bait the the Thunder have to trade is Steven Adams.

Other players possibly packaged with Adams are Danillo Gallinari, Dennis Schroeder, and Andre Roberson as the rebuilding team doesn't have anything to lose trading away players that are not a part of the young core. If CP3 does get traded again it will have to be in either in a huge blockbuster three way deal with Steven Adams involved or a separate deal altogether.

The Lakers trade involving CP3 would be a hall but only include 3 players who are set to make the 10-man rotation. The trade would be Danny Green, Avery Bradley, Javale McGee, Alex Caruso, Demetrius Jackson, Jordan Caroline, and Demarcus cousins headed to the OKC Thunder for CP3.

Will this trade go down?

Probably not. I really don't see the Lakers throwing 7 players into the mix and getting rid of Danny Green while he is playing so well.

Then again, Green's value may not get any higher than right now and his impact may decline this season so if they were to move him this would be the time as he has one more year left on his contract.

Should the Lakers make this trade?

Maybe.

Anthony Davis does not want to play center and losing major front court depth in a player like Javale McGee can be detrimental to the Lakers rotation if they want to win games this season.

Chris Paul has proven to be one of the best guards of all time and played really well in the playoffs as a second option for the Houston Rockets facing one of the greatest teams of all time in the Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant led Golden State Warriors who already won a championship with both MVPs on their roster. Chris Paul and the Houston Rockets took the Golden State Warriors to game 7 of a tough Western Conference Finals series just two years ago as a 32 year old exiting his prime.

The problem is losing Danny Green. Without Green, the Lakers might be more exposed than they are at the guard position relying on guards like Rajon Rondo and Quinn Cook to guard opposing point guard threats like Damian Lillard and Kyrie Irving. Green brings somewhat of an X-factor to the Lakers, where he can guard multiple positions and is as versatile defensively as they come at the guard position.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,67614,public,self,The Controversy Of A Trade That Would Send Chris Paul To The Lakers,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/di0fgf/the_controversy_of_a_trade_that_would_send_chris/,,,,,,,,,,,1572072008.0,,,,,

This is just my perspective and insights on the situation and are not meant to be taken out of context. I also posted on [r/nba](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/), but I thought I'd come here for a more rational discussion.

With Chinese broadcaster Tencent resuming broadcasts of preseason NBA games, it feels like the controversy that started with Daryl Morey's tweet has finally blown over, but the deep-rooted issues that caused this still exist and even grew stronger.

The NBA is extremely short-sighted if they didn't expect something of this magnitude to happen and ""should have anticipated the challenges of doing business in a country run by a repressive single party government—including by being prepared to stand in strong defense of the freedom of expression of its employees, players, and affiliates across the globe,"" according to a bipartisan group of US Senators and Representatives. After all, their business in China is based on a partnership with an authoritarian regime that completely contradicts the values of liberty, freedom, and natural rights that the United States and its people embrace. For context, China doesn't have a strong cultural emphasis on individual rights and freedom of expression that we see in modern Western countries. The philosophers whose work inspired much of our legal systems (Locke, Hobbes, Paine, etc.) believed that humans have inherent human rights and that they should be protected at all costs. However, in China, the dominant philosophy is one that emphasizes government power and social order over individual rights, and China has an omnipresent government-centered propaganda campaign to convince the citizens to believe it.

Although all Morey said was that he supports freedom for people of Hong Kong, it was still enough to rattle the CPC, as they obviously tried to coerce the NBA into firing Morey through the loss of NBA revenue. For example, Chinese state-run broadcast network CCTV has pulled broadcasts of the Nets vs. Lakers games, took down all NBA advertisements, and suspended all broadcasts of Rockets games in China. Anta, the Chinese shoe brand that sponsors Klay Thompson, Gordon Hayward, Rajon Rondo, and Kevon Looney, suspended all contract negotiations with the NBA. Vivo, a Chinese phone company that sponsored the NBA China games, suspended all cooperation with the league. The CPC's aggressive retaliation against Morey and the NBA demonstrates the power of the NBA's influence on China -- which brings me to my second point.

It seems that the NBA somewhat gave in to the CPC's demands and failed to embrace the mindset of not ""shutting up and dribbling"" that it seems to pride itself on. In fact, Commissioner Adam Silver told CNN just last year that ""part of being an NBA player"" is social activism and a ""sense of an obligation, social responsibility, \[and\] a desire to speak up directly about issues that are important."" Silver stated the league wants players to ""be multi-dimensional people and fully participate as citizens."" He specifically explained that the league had a role in ensuring that the situation remains ""safe"" for players afraid of suffering career blowback.

The league and players could have helped expose China's unethical human rights abuses to the world -- in particular, its sociopolitical oppression of its own citizens, the violation of the Hong Kong agreement and its citizens' respective rights according to that agreement, and the persecution of Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.

However, the NBA failed to do so, as demonstrated by Harden's comments supporting China, Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich's (two of the most politically outspoken people in the league) reluctance to talk about it, and Adam Silver's initial apology to China. Players and coaches have spoken out on issues before, meaning they clearly have opinions and value free speech, but now they refuse to speak about this issue as they state the sorry excuse of not being informed enough about the situation in Hong Kong -- a cop-out for political media questions.

The NBA and its sponsors typically support progressive politics, so speaking out on past domestic issues of social justice was easy and good for American-based business. Now, speaking out is costly, and everyone associated with the NBA is afraid to do so in order to keep their billions of dollars in Chinese revenue -- despite the possible positive impact it could have on the millions of oppressed people who lack basic human rights. The players or coaches are not at all expected to publicly condemn China, film documentaries about Hong Kong or Uighur, or even know the nuances of HK and Chinese politics. But at the very least, they can support and stand with a colleague (Daryl Morey) for speaking his mind.

The NBA can afford to and should be willing to lose its contract and economically beneficial place in China's entertainment/sports industry if it truly embodies and embraces American democratic values of liberty and freedom over profits coming at the cost of others' natural rights.

According to the same group of US Senators and Representatives, ""It’s not unreasonable to expect \[the NBA\] to put our fundamental democratic rights ahead of profit — the very rights that have fostered their success and our nation’s wealth."" The issue here is if free-speech against another country's injustices is worthwhile in light of revenue loss, and in this controversy, the NBA seems to value China's money over its human rights abuses. Its submissiveness and lack of resistance to the CPC seem disingenuous on the NBA's part and undermines their previous and future comments about political issues. When it was easy, they spoke. When it was hard, they were silent.

Sure, China and its people have thrown a fit like a crybaby, but their antics actually worked, and their influence on a league and people across the Pacific Ocean is scary to see. It actually made the players SHUT UP AND DRIBBLE. Looking at the bigger picture, the CPC is trying to set a large-scale precedent to all American companies -- you bow down to China and its sociopolitical policies and reap the benefits of its economic might and market power, or the government and entire country suffocate your company and brand economically in China and even your reputation and marketing in America.

It is quite obvious that the CPC used this controversy as a test to see how much can the CPC influence foreign media and what methods will work in doing so? This isn't an example of China being overly insecure or the Streisand effect (how China is not going to stop people from talking about HK and other problems). The Chinese government may be one of the most brutal and authoritarian ones out there, but it is also hyper-competent -- especially regarding its propaganda campaign. They used this situation not to make the NBA back down but to force other companies to think about the consequences of allowing negative speech about China.

There are going to be several high-profile issues like this in the coming years as companies try to grapple with attempting to please two sets of people who have radically different ways of viewing the world. At some point, there will be a climax to this conflict of interest, and the democratic nations and entities of the world need to stand behind their ideals and not bow down to the Chinese and their economy.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:**

The US and China have very different political systems and ideologies, so therefore, CPC aggressively retaliated against the NBA for Morey's comments. The CPC's retaliation shows the NBA's influence in China.

The NBA prides itself on being a forward-thinking, politically active organization. The coaches and players spoke out about past issues.

The NBA' had the opportunity to expose China's human rights abuses and made an impact in the situation, but it remained reluctant to speak out after Morey's tweet. When it was easy, they spoke. When it was hard, they were silent.

Now that billions of dollars are involved, the NBA refuses to stand by its employee, Morey. The NBA should fight for the US' democratic values of liberty and freedom over profits coming at the cost of others' natural rights, but the NBA seems to value China's money over its human rights abuses.

I also posted on r/nba, but I thought I'd come here for a more rational discussion.)

With Chinese broadcaster Tencent resuming broadcasts of preseason NBA games, it feels like the controversy that started with Daryl Morey's tweet has finally blown over, but the deep-rooted issues that caused this still exist and even grew stronger.

The NBA is extremely short-sighted if they didn't expect something of this magnitude to happen and ""should have anticipated the challenges of doing business in a country run by a repressive single party government—including by being prepared to stand in strong defense of the freedom of expression of its employees, players, and affiliates across the globe,"" according to a bipartisan group of US Senators and Representatives. After all, their business in China is based on a partnership with an authoritarian regime that completely contradicts the values of liberty, freedom, and natural rights that the United States and its people embrace. For context, China doesn't have a strong cultural emphasis on individual rights and freedom of expression that we see in modern Western countries. The philosophers whose work inspired much of our legal systems (Locke, Hobbes, Paine, etc.) believed that humans have inherent human rights and that they should be protected at all costs. However, in China, the dominant philosophy is one that emphasizes government power and social order over individual rights, and China has an omnipresent government-centered propaganda campaign to convince the citizens to believe it.

Although all Morey said was that he supports freedom for people of Hong Kong, it was still enough to rattle the CPC, as they obviously tried to coerce the NBA into firing Morey through the loss of NBA revenue. For example, Chinese state-run broadcast network CCTV has pulled broadcasts of the Nets vs. Lakers games, took down all NBA advertisements, and suspended all broadcasts of Rockets games in China. Anta, the Chinese shoe brand that sponsors Klay Thompson, Gordon Hayward, Rajon Rondo, and Kevon Looney, suspended all contract negotiations with the NBA. Vivo, a Chinese phone company that sponsored the NBA China games, suspended all cooperation with the league. The CPC's aggressive retaliation against Morey and the NBA demonstrates the power of the NBA's influence on China -- which brings me to my second point.

It seems that the NBA somewhat gave in to the CPC's demands and failed to embrace the mindset of not ""shutting up and dribbling"" that it seems to pride itself on. In fact, Commissioner Adam Silver told CNN just last year that ""part of being an NBA player"" is social activism and a ""sense of an obligation, social responsibility, \[and\] a desire to speak up directly about issues that are important."" Silver stated the league wants players to ""be multi-dimensional people and fully participate as citizens."" He specifically explained that the league had a role in ensuring that the situation remains ""safe"" for players afraid of suffering career blowback.

The league and players could have helped expose China's unethical human rights abuses to the world -- in particular, its sociopolitical oppression of its own citizens, the violation of the Hong Kong agreement and its citizens' respective rights according to that agreement, and the persecution of Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.

However, the NBA failed to do so, as demonstrated by Harden's comments supporting China, Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich's (two of the most politically outspoken people in the league) reluctance to talk about it, and Adam Silver's initial apology to China. Players and coaches have spoken out on issues before, meaning they clearly have opinions and value free speech, but now they refuse to speak about this issue as they state the sorry excuse of not being informed enough about the situation in Hong Kong -- a cop-out for political media questions.

The NBA and its sponsors typically support progressive politics, so speaking out on past domestic issues of social justice was easy and good for American-based business. Now, speaking out is costly, and everyone associated with the NBA is afraid to do so in order to keep their billions of dollars in Chinese revenue -- despite the possible positive impact it could have on the millions of oppressed people who lack basic human rights. The players or coaches are not at all expected to publicly condemn China, film documentaries about Hong Kong or Uighur, or even know the nuances of HK and Chinese politics. But at the very least, they can support and stand with a colleague (Daryl Morey) for speaking his mind.

The NBA can afford to and should be willing to lose its contract and economically beneficial place in China's entertainment/sports industry if it truly embodies and embraces American democratic values of liberty and freedom over profits coming at the cost of others' natural rights.

According to the same group of US Senators and Representatives, ""It’s not unreasonable to expect \[the NBA\] to put our fundamental democratic rights ahead of profit — the very rights that have fostered their success and our nation’s wealth."" The issue here is if free-speech against another country's injustices is worthwhile in light of revenue loss, and in this controversy, the NBA seems to value China's money over its human rights abuses. Its submissiveness and lack of resistance to the CPC seem disingenuous on the NBA's part and undermines their previous and future comments about political issues. When it was easy, they spoke. When it was hard, they were silent.

Sure, China and its people have thrown a fit like a crybaby, but their antics actually worked, and their influence on a league and people across the Pacific Ocean is scary to see. It actually made the players SHUT UP AND DRIBBLE. Looking at the bigger picture, the CPC is trying to set a large-scale precedent to all American companies -- you bow down to China and its sociopolitical policies and reap the benefits of its economic might and market power, or the government and entire country suffocate your company and brand economically in China and even your reputation and marketing in America.

It is quite obvious that the CPC used this controversy as a test to see how much can the CPC influence foreign media and what methods will work in doing so? This isn't an example of China being overly insecure or the Streisand effect (how China is not going to stop people from talking about HK and other problems). The Chinese government may be one of the most brutal and authoritarian ones out there, but it is also hyper-competent -- especially regarding its propaganda campaign. They used this situation not to make the NBA back down but to force other companies to think about the consequences of allowing negative speech about China.

There are going to be several high-profile issues like this in the coming years as companies try to grapple with attempting to please two sets of people who have radically different ways of viewing the world. At some point, there will be a climax to this conflict of interest, and the democratic nations and entities of the world need to stand behind their ideals and not bow down to the Chinese and their economy.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,67601,public,self,Closing thoughts on the Morey/NBA/China Controversy.

**Devin Booker**

Teams that could make a compelling trade

Knicks, Magic, Detroit, Nuggets, Timberwolves, Spurs (maybe), Pelicans

**Karl Anthony Towns**

Knicks, Hawks, Celtics, Spurs (again maybe)

**Bradley Beal**

Hawks, Magic, Detroit, Nuggets, Pelicans, Spurs (once again, maybe). 

The reason there are big maybe's for the **Spurs** are because they'd most likely have to give up at least 2 of Murray, White, Walker. Not sure how much the Wizards, Wolves, Suns, would value them. But outside of that, the Spurs don't have any superstars on the team. Derozan and Aldridge are all star caliber players but i wouldn't call them superstars. KAT would be the perfect person to build around if they can keep Derrick White as i see White as someone who will be around the Borderline All Star level in the future. 

**Knicks** would be smarter to trade for Booker or KAT but not Beal simply for the fact that they're younger. They'll fit with the timeline and still have room to grow. Beal is 26 and fits a team more established that needs that player to push them forward. If i'm the Knicks, when trading for them, everyone besides RJ Barrett and the 2019 pick is on the table. RJ is their prospect that has the highest upside imo. Mitchell Robinson is good but its hard to see him as anything more than a rim running defensive player. the 2019 pick should be off limits due to the teams desperate need for a PG. the picks from 2020 on as well as dallas picks should still be good enough. 

**Hawks** skip out on Booker but can take a look at at Towns and Beal. Booker seems like he'd be more ball dominant and that would clash with how Young plays. Also that back court defense would be horrible. Young/Towns pick and roll, pick and pop would be stupid good. Basically if i'm the Hawks and look to trade for Towns, everyone besides Young is on the table. Beal fits them imo because i feel there one Trae Young break out season shy of the playoffs. They'd be a nutty shooting back court. 

**Detroit** and the **Magic** are in the same boat due to their needs for dynamic guard play. Both teams have good front courts but they're back courts need serious upgrades. I feel Detroit can benefit more from Beal due to Jackson's ball dominant nature. The Magic can benefit more from Booker due to his ability create plays for others. 

I have the **Timberwolves** on the list for Booker because outside of KAT they don't have any other super dynamic players. Trading for Booker gets complicated though. Because it would require significant assets. Once they use up those assets for Booker they'll have nothing to attach to an Andrew Wiggins trade if they try to get rid of him. If they use the assets to drop Wiggins, then they can't get Booker. It gets tricky. I say they're best chance at Booker is if someone trades for Beal, then the Wizards look to ship off Wall. They could probably send out Wiggins and something small for Wall. Wall would still probably give them 16 and 7 after injury. Although hes a similarly bad contract (maybe worse). He'd be a better player and i'd trust a Wall, Booker, Kat team over one with Wiggins on it. 

**Nuggets** are on this list only if they feel that Jamal Murray and Harris aren't going to cut it. Not going to go super in depth with them because i'm one of those if it aint broke dont fix it kinda guys. Nuggets are good, Beal and Booker would be upgrades of course. But its not like they desperately need them. 

**Pelicans**, like the Nuggets, are a team i wont spend too much time talking about. They are young and guys could take leaps this year (lonzo, Ingram), but they're on the list mainly because they could trade for Beal and Booker if they wanted too. 

All of the **Celtics** centers are pretty trash and i'd say thats easily their biggest weakness. The issue is that the Wolves probably wouldn't entertain a trade for KAT without the Celtics adding Tatum. The only way i see them keeping Tatum is if the Memphis pick this year is the 7th pick (its top 6 protected). They can use that pick along with possibly brown, and whatever other assets necessary to grab KAT. Kemba, Tatum, KAT and Hayward if he returns to form would be nasty.

Side Notes:

Initially had Thunder on the KAT list but took them off because any trade for KAT requires SGA and thats pointless. You'd want to pair them not trade them for each other. 

Didn't list the Cavs because i feel they don't have the assets to pull off a big trade. 

Same with Dallas, they used their assets in the KP trade. They dont have any 1st round picks to trade until 2025

If these 3 players did request a trade i think the 1 team that would push the hardest for each player would be

Devin Booker - Knicks

KAT - Celtics

Beal - i honestly don't know",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,67590,public,self,"What would be the trade value, teams interested, and possible potential trades if these players were to ask for a trade this season?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/dhvhga/what_would_be_the_trade_value_teams_interested/,,,,,,,,,,,1572066863.0,,,,,

QUESTION: Is there any reasons why top franchise players are not able to negotiate equity vs. cash (or some mix)?

Many companies compensate senior executives with equity (to align interest, reward the folks that are contributing to the growth of the business, etc.), however I never really heard of this being done with players.

The one example that comes to mind often is Steph Curry’s contribution to the Warriors’ franchise. I recall reading when Joe Lacob and Peter Guber bought the Warriors for ~$450mm around the time that Steph joined the team. Although today Steph is well compensated in relation to other high performing players, I can’t help but think about his contribution to the franchise’s current valuation which is well over $3bn today. As a franchise player, why wouldn’t you want equity compensation over the years in lieu of a ~$200mm contract?

Thomas is an excellent shooter but requires development of his defensive skill set to be much of a defensive contributor for the Raptors. I like seeing players from the Euro League have success in the NBA and if Thomas finds success with the Raptors then Toronto could become a more sought-after destination for Euro League players who want to make the jump to the NBA.

Last season with Valencia Basket Thomas registered .511 FG%/.485 3P%/.545 2P% during a 29 game span. Clearly Thomas can shoot the ball at an efficient and satisfying rate. When he is wide open his FG% skyrockets to a whopping 99% success rate which likely is a sign of how the Raptors plan to deploy him during games. The Raptors, lost Danny Green in the off season, and are in dire need of field shooters especially from 3-point land.  Matt Thomas should be able to fill a portion of the void left by Green as Thomas will likely be apart of this year’s version of the Bench Mob. Initial reports suggest he has struggled shooting the ball during pre-season action thus far, but I expect him to recover from these woes and at worst be a catch and shoot marksman for Nurse to strategically insert into the lineup. Obviously I hope he becomes more than just a catch and shoot 3 point shooter but the Euro League is not the NBA and I expect Thomas to have a learning curve to overcome as he enters the league. 

The Raptors signed Thomas to a three-year deal which shows they have faith in both his current skill set and believe they can develop him as an overall player. At 24 years of age Thomas has an opportunity to refine his shooting at the NBA level while also having an opportunity to up his defensive game. Nurse and company should be able to help Thomas develop his defensive skill set with his ceiling  being that of a 3 and D type player. Thomas should have a floor of a catch and shoot player if his defensive development does not go well. 

Assuming the Raptors can develop Matt Thomas and he finds success in the NBA this could lead to Toronto becoming a more desirable destination for International players. The Euro League has a lot of talent in it and there seems to be a steady level of interest for Euro League players to want to come to the NBA. Toronto has long faced the challenge of attracting top free agents from the United States to come North to the land of ice and snow. Perhaps between Nick Nurse’s experience with the Euro League and the potential success that Matt Thomas in Toronto, a foundation can be laid for Toronto to become one of the most desirable locations for international players to want to bring their talents to. This in turn would provide the Raptors an alternative market to attract and sign free agents from as they build future rosters. Attracting solely Euro League players is not the answer to the Raptor’s free agent challenges but the Euro League could help fill many depth positions for the Raptors in years to come. Thomas could be the first of many who make the jump across the Atlantic pond to and come to Toronto. 

In summary, Matt Thomas brings with him sniper like shooting skills that the Raptors should be able to almost immediately cash in on this season. Thomas has the potential to become a 3 and D wing but needs to further develop his defensive skills at the NBA level. The signing of Thomas and his potential success could open a pipeline for international talent to want to come to Toronto so they can break into the NBA and continue to further up their game as part of the Toronto Raptors. Only time will tell but as the season draws nearer, I am becoming more excited about the potential that Matt Thomas has as a member of the Raptors.

They have also made some highly questionable decisions that leave them with a lineup that mot very many people are hyped on. 538 gives them a [12% chance to make the playoffs, based on player skill, and 2% based on Elo.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-nba-predictions/)

But looking at their roster construction, I think they have a great chance of making the playoffs. Rubio is a proven, veteran point guard who went to the post-season both of the last two years, averaging 15.4/3.2/8.6 in the series against the Rockets. He's not a great scorer, but he doesn't need to be with this team.

Booker is Booker. His 26.6/4.1/6.8 last season was overlooked, but if he makes another leap this year, his will be an all-star and potentially all-nba guard.


Oubre, he's struggled. Orlando is not known for their stellar player development, and he was hot-and-cold in the Magic uniform. But in 40 games as a Sun, he went 16.9/4.9/1.6 and he's only a year older than Booker. I think he can be a solid starter and a great third option on offense.

Saric is scrappy. His numbers are rarely great, but he knows how to fill in on both sides of the court, stretch the floor, and hustle. I've always been a fan of him

Ayton is the big wild card. He had a fantastic rookie season, averaging a double double, and looks to improve in the next few years. If he lives up to the hype of being the first pick in the draft, Ayton and Booker could be one of the most exciting duos in the league. And maybe with Rubio handling the ball, Ayton will actually get more touches in the post.

As far as backups, Tyler Johnson, 	Mikal Bridges, Frank Kaminsky and Aron Baynes are all fine in limited minutes. And I'm expecting one of the young core: Bridges, Cameron Johnson (11th pick) or Ty Jerome (24th pick) to step up this year. If one of those young guns does become a dangerous 6th man off the bench, I think the Suns are in a good position to make the playoffs. Compared to 538's prediction, I would I would put the Suns in over the Timberwolves.

In addition, they also are significantly limited on defense. While Derrick White and Dejounte Murray are both excellent perimeter defenders, the team defense is more than likely going to be extremely limited. 

Demar Derozan is maybe the spurs best scorer going strictly by volume but his skill set adds nothing to the offense and he is a big liability guarding 3s. (In fact, I would not mind if Murray guarded the other team’s 3.) His impact metrics paint a picture of him never really helping the offense. His passing has improved but his “creation” for other players is severely limited because of his inability to space the floor.

Obviously, he’s incredibly motivated this year. He was in Boston, too, however. This isn’t the first time he’s felt he had to prove it, but it being HIS decision where he landed may make a difference. 

More than anything, though, this post is about Kenny Atkinson. The PG whisperer. Every guard he gets his hands on seems to have a career year. 

Linsanity? He was on the Knicks staff, working one on one with Lin often (part of why he signed with us in our bleakest hour, though sadly injury robbed us of most of the 2 year reunion). 

The 5 All Star Hawks team? He was on staff, the one Teague personally credits with his added success that year. 

Since taking over with the Nets, he got D’Lo his first all star berth. He picked Dinwiddie up from a G Leaguer to 6MotY candidate. LeVert, despite injuries, looks poised for a MIP player run (as he did last year, before the ankle injury). 

Time and time again Kenny has gotten the absolute best out of the guards that he coaches. 

The question is does he have a big impact on Irving, or is Kyrie already near his skill cap? Does he have the drive of the superstars to work tirelessly even while already one of the top players in the league?

**Note**: I'm not saying these guys are going to be superstars by any means. They are very solid role players who can start if needed and be strong contributors off the bench. Allonzo Trier is a bit more gifted and has the offensive potential to be a 6moty candidate in the future.

Allonzo Trier was an undrafted rookie last season. In hindsight he'd probably go somewhere in the teens in a redraft. When saw him during summer league, as fans we didn't like him. He couldn't pass, he couldn't score well, he just didn't look good. Knicks gave him a 2 way contract and all of a sudden a switch flipped. Trier was taking players off the dribble and attacking super hard getting and 1's. He's a really talented offensive player who can take almost any defender off the dribble, blow past them, and finish strong at the rim. [Here's a highlight video of Trier's rookie year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRHDKINkCRQ). His herky jerky style of play and 3 level play are what make me give him the Lou Williams comparison. 

His weaknesses though are sometimes he can hog the ball. I believe in either high school or college this was a complaint that he got from his teammate. He's a very talent offensive scorer and it might get to his head a bit. Playmaking is another weakness but thats mainly due to his black hole nature. He can play point guard, has done it in HS and College but is mainly a SG. 

Damyean Dotson was drafted 44th in the 2017 draft. He easily outplayed his draft slot and would most likely go in the 20's in a redraft. His rookie season he was injured a lot and only played around 40ish games. Last year he greatly improved his entire game but still has a consistency issue. With Dotson he's either going to shoot 50% from 3 or 17%, theres no in between for him. While hes not super young at age 25, he still has room for growth due to him only being in the league for 2 years. He has gotten much stronger from his rookie to sophomore year which i believe helped alot with his shooting in his 2nd year. I expect him to shoot closer to 38, 39% from 3 this year with much improved defense and have around 13 ppg if he can get the minutes on this jammed Knicks team. He's not a lock down defender but he is above average. Teams were actually calling the Knicks about Dotson towards last years trade deadline and Knicks declined all trades. Dotson has tons of value as a role player or possible starter on some teams due to his ability to shoot and play defense. 

[Here is Damyean Dotson scoring 27 points, 8/13 from 3. Showcasing his off ball and catch and shoot game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUsFyp8SLQQ)

The NBA max player contract is tied to a % of the NBA salary cap for the first year with built in raises annually. (i believe this is how they work, subsequent years on the deal are not subject to fluctuations in revenue). The annual raises are also percentage based. (again if im wrong please me know). 

As the max contract continues to rise with the exploding league revenue, the subsequent yearly raises become larger (this is very important. again if true).

If an outside factor were to drastically decrease NBA revenue (lets say the economy tanks and another ron artest type situation happens) teams would end up with potentially being over the cap on just 2 players. 

Would the NBA have to impose some type of salary cap mitigation where teams are allowed to cut x% of signed players, etc. to help teams out or just let them fend for themselves? 

Another interesting part is that this would affect good teams much more than bad teams.

I know league revenue has gone down in the past and they didnt do anything but the salary raises back then were not like now. Since raises are percentage based and tied to the original contract.

Miami for example had long term plans of pairing another max player next to butler and the young players. If the cap shrinks those plans are out the window and some teams would be DEEP into the luxury tax.

It’s a billion-people market. Smart move, though it’d be tough to find an all-star level talent in any country that hasn’t really played the sport. 

China has over a billion population, is a much more developed nation, has more money and their fans are way more excited about NBA. That being said, out of all that we only had like 1 Chinese NBA player, Yao Ming. Would we see any superstar from India anytime soon? India has 1.x billion people, 2nd largest population in the world, and wins a only handful of medals at things like the Olympics. India just lacks a guy like Yao they can really promote.

India has proven they can churn out some of the best athletes in a sport, all they need is public interest. there is no sport that China is as good at as India is at cricket.

They have potential. There exists several barriers in front of them (infrastructure, professional staffing, resource allocation, but most notably, culture). Look at athletes in America. For the most part, they are black or white. You rarely see Asian athletes. Now look at professional schools in America. They are dominated by Asians (chinese, indian, or descendents of other neighboring countries). That's the reality of it. Asian culture prioritizes academics over sports. Even if the child has potential to be an elite athlete, they will not receive the encouragement , time , and resources necessary to succeed in a sports career in America, much less in China or India. That is the biggest reason

China was at a lower GDP per capita when Yao entered the league and made the NBA blow up in China. BUT China's GFP grew at an insane rate during that time. In 2002, China's GDP per capital was about 2.5 times the size India's. In 2017, China's GDP per capita was about 4.5 times times the size of India's.

Maybe the NBA is trying to tap into the India market, but it's not really comparable to the absolutely mind blowing growth in wealth that China has seen. People in China went from no electricity and living in rice fields to having smart phones in one generation.

China's authoritarian nature stops it from doing that, because they personally had pick kids that they think will be good athletes, creating an artificial barrier on the capacity to produce the athletes.

BUT Many things in India are just different. There are many even if they won't openly talk about it who to them look down upon this ""American way of following your passions and doing what you want"". In India tradition is much more king. IN other words for many upper class men it's become a doctor/engineer or businessmen and have your family arrange a marriage for you once you hit your late 20s. No matter how different people's backgrounds/skills/interests might be you'll be surprised just how many end up converging and following this type of path. Im obviously generalizing to an extent but the pt is there's not going to be nearly the same level of support in many cases of someone with legitimate basketball talent pursuing that passion in India as it would be in America. And without that support and infrastructure in place to help develop teenage talent it's just not going to really work often times.

With regards to women things have definitely improved the past 50 yrs but there's a good bit of sexism and general remnants of patriarchy throughout India. What I was talking about how there isn't really the most open culture in India towards kids just following whatever their passions are if they don't conform to norms........it's even worse for women. Also add in the fact that potential WNBA/women's basketball salary isn't near that of mens. Pursuing sports as a career is really only an option for the very liberal and very wealthy in India. India does seem to have changed pretty dramatically over the last 25 years, I don’t have a very good window into how much though.

This rating combines player tracking data, play by play data, traditional box score data, and plus minus data to create a new all-in-one metric. This is the first time all of these information sources have been combined publicly in a single metric. 

[Their main introduction article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/introducing-raptor-our-new-metric-for-the-modern-nba/) does a good job of explaining the new metric and includes a table with player ratings for the past 6 seasons.

[Their methodology article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-our-raptor-metric-works/) dives into the wonky details. Their discussion of what is and isn't predictive yields some interesting basketball insights. 

They do a better job of describing their metric than I ever could, so I'll refrain from summarizing here and instead suggest you check out the above links.

There are a bunch of interesting and innovative aspects to RAPTOR that are new to public NBA metrics. Here is a brief overview of some of them:

-Lots of interesting things with player tracking data, such as using % of FGs assisted, assist quality, time of possession (it's a negative), differentiating between different TO types, shots defended, opponent FG%, differentiating between fouls in and out of the penalty, and many more.

-Different forward looking (predictive) and backward looking (descriptive) versions that use different weights and different information (for example predictive version uses height, age, and draft position while descriptive doesn't). There's also a separate version for seasons before tracking data became available in 2014 (MJ dominates).

-New approach to the on/off component. Instead of using RAPM like in RPM or a simpler on/off like PTPM, they attempt to account for a player's teammates and opponents in a way that somewhat mirrors RAPM but converges much faster.

-Modular and transparent design and data. Every calculation is revealed, unlike a black box such as RPM. Every formula component is combined in a modular fashion, so there is nothing like BPM's infamous AST*REB term where it is ambiguous what is being measured. This also means component terms can be useful in answering more specific questions and has value outside of just being an all-in-one. 

Overall I think they've done an excellent job. This metric has been a long time in the making and it shows. Their rigorous out of sample testing at multiple stages, inclusion of more information sources than ever before with tracking data, and dedication to applying good basketball logic instead of brute-forcing the best statistical fit all indicate there's a good chance this is the best publicly available all-in-one.

With all the player movement and shakeup in rosters, **the final regular season standings will NOT reflect the actual best teams in each conference**. Teams with more continuity and established systems will outperform more talented teams that are still figuring it out for parts of the season. I also think that the Western teams will all be very close and multiple of these teams will be interchangeable in the standings but that these are the 8 teams I am positive will make the playoffs, barring any serious injuries.

**WEST**

1. Nuggets

2. Jazz

3. Rockets

4. Lakers

5. Warriors

6. Blazers

7. Clippers

8. Spurs

*Honorable mention: Mavericks, Pelicans*

**Top 4 Teams Overall: Lakers, Clippers, Rockets, Warriors**

The Nuggets won 54 games despite missing multiple starters for a good portion of the season. Their young players will improve with another year of experience, and they are adding Micheal Porter Jr. and Jerami Grant to their young group. The Jazz are another strong team that addressed their biggest concerns this offseason by adding Conley and a consistent 3&amp;D wing in Bogdanovic. The Rockets were a game away from the second season last year despite missing CP3 for the majority of the season. Regardless of how you feel about the potential fit of Russ, he is insanely durable and having another All-Star on the floor is better than having nobody at all. The Lakers IMO are the best team in the West but as long as they're a top 4 seed they'll probably coast for most of the season and make sure Bron and AD are 100 percent healthy. The Warriors will still have 4 All Stars but they will miss a key player in Klay until around March so they will have some adversity in the regular season having to overcome their lack of depth. However, they still have a top 3 player in Curry, a DPOY candidate in Draymond, and  a young emerging All-Star in DLo until Klay returns. The Blazers are underrated by most predictions as usual, but they have consistently outperformed preseason predictions. This year they have a good deal of roster movement, with only 4 rotation players from last year returning, but Dame and CJ make this team a playoff lock. The Clippers are another team that has elite talent, and while I think they'll still be great in the regular season, PG is going to miss a decent amount of time with his injury and Kawhi will miss his fair share of games as well due to load management. They have top 4 level talent but they have some injuries and will not be going 100 percent in the regular season. The Spurs were a playoff team last year despite all the injuries to young players and having to integrate a new star in DeRozan, and they'll be a lot better this season, but the West will be too competitive for them to sniff the top 4. 

The Mavericks will start off the season on fire with Luka and KP and look like a top 4 seed at first, but they will soon cool off and I see them barely missing out on the playoffs. The Pelicans shine individually but overall lack the talent to make the playoffs in this ultra competitive year. The Kings young players will all improve a lot playing under a coach like Walton who will embrace their high pace even more, but overall I'm not sure if they'll be able to pull off the clutch play and close victories they did last season.

**EAST**

1. Bucks

2. Sixers

3. Raptors

4. Heat

5. Nets

6. Magic

7. Pacers

8. Celtics

*Honorable mention: Pistons, Hawks*

**Top 4 Teams Overall: Bucks, Sixers, Raptors, Heat**

The Bucks are coming of a 60 win season with almost everyone from last year returning and Giannis will be hungry for revenge after he lost out on winning a title last season. The Sixers IMO are the most talented team in this conference but issues with their fit and spacing will cause them to take a little longer to figure everything out, and I think they ultimately finish below the Bucks. I'm biased regarding the Raptors but I think Norman Powell and Pascal Siakam step up this season and Lowry/Gasol/Ibaka all make big contributions to a top 4 seed. The Heat and Nets will also outperform preseason expectations. The Heat have always had a top 5 defense and have a great coach, and they now have an alpha in Jimmy Butler who can effectively command their offense. Meanwhile in Brooklyn, Kyrie is only 27 years old and has improved every year. This year I'm sure he is eager for a fresh start and to prove himself after last year's debacle. Kyrie will prove that he is a top 4 PG and lead the Nets to the fifth seed despite having no other stars on the roster for this year with KD out. The Magic are a young team that ended last year hot; even though it's usually not that great of an idea to put a lot of stock into late-season hot streaks, I think their young players continue to improve and Orlando does good this season. Indiana is a talented team but they will miss Oladipo for a while and their record last year before he went down was inflated because they faced so many bad teams. The Celtics downgraded a lot this offseason; Kyrie to Kemba was a slight downgrade but losing Horford was a huge blow. Horford anchored their excellent defense and excelled in the clutch. I always felt that although Kyrie was their most talented player, Horford was the most important player in Boston.

**BOOM OR BUST TEAMS:** Boston, Dallas

Like I said just earlier, I think Boston downgraded a lot, but if Brown (contract year!) and Tatum return to form and play better after a fresh start than they did with Kyrie, it'll help Boston a lot. And while Horford to Kanter is a huge downgrade, Kanter is a great offensive player who brings a rebounding presence that former Celtics teams never had. Kemba has never played on a true contender before, and we'll see this year if his numbers were due to how many shots he took or if it was in spite of the lack of talent surrounding him.

Dallas is going to start off this year extremely hot, and KP will look amazing out of the gate. I'm paranoid that Porzingis will get hurt again. He has a tendency to cool down after the beginning of the season. I know I predicted them to barely miss the playoffs in the West, but if they had a monster year I wouldn't be surprised.

#Playoff Predictions

The West playoffs are going to be chaotic. Since there are so many talented teams, I feel like the playoff seeding will make a huge difference due to its influence on the matchups each team will encounter. However, I still think the top 4 teams overall are the Lakers, Rockets, Clippers, and Warriors. I think the Clippers are a lower seed that should fuck up a top 4 seed in the playoffs. However if the standings are close and the Clippers risk the health of PG and Kawhi to secure a playoff spot, I could see them fizzling out quickly. Still, I have the Lakers making it out of the West barring injury as long as they don't face a horrible matchup.

The East playoffs are more predictable. Bucks and Sixers cruise past the first round. I think the Raptors and Heat make it to the second round as well. If the Raptors are the same as last year, we easily lose in the second round, but if Siakam continues his growth into a legit star and #1 option, we have a shot at the ECF. The Heat are a scrappy team that will give a higher seed fits in the second round. I still predict Bucks vs. Sixers in the ECF. If the Sixers play Giannis similar to the way the Raptors did last year, they should be able to reach the Finals.

**Finals Prediction: Lakers over Sixers**

#Individual Predictions

**Players who will have a big/improved year:** AD, Curry, Westbrook, Kyrie, Siakam, KP, Butler, Beal, Lonzo, Ayton, Trae, S. Adams

**Players who will have a down year:** Harden(compared to last season), Simmons/Embiid (will improve as players but counting stats will go down), Bledsoe, Millsap, Lou Will, Danny Green, Winslow (lower usage rate w/Butler)

AD will look like a top 5 player next to LeBron. Curry will have another MVP level season. Siakam takes another step and enters superstar conversation. Lonzo and Trae are in the MIP race. Russell Westbrook has the best defensive season of his career. Beal puts up insane stats on the Wizards and will be the subject of trade talks all season.

I'm very high on Simmons and I really think he'll improve this year but I'm not sure how his counting stats will look this year now that he has even less spacing around him and is still a horrible shooter. Bledsoe and Danny Green have historically showed up in contract years like last year and they'll still be good but I'm not sure how they'll fare compared to last year. Lou Will will have a far less usage rate given that Doc Rivers will probably have one of PG/Kawhi on the floor at all times.

**Surprise prediction: Collin Sexton has a huge year out of nowhere and looks like a future superstar**

#Awards predictions:

I never predict these super accurately but fuck it, let's give it another shot.

MVP: Jokic (If the Warriors get a top 4 seed, Curry)

DPOY: AD

ROY: Zion

MIP: Trae Young

##Miscellaneous predictions

I feel like teams around the league are going to go big again. I always felt like small ball was less about size and had more to do with skill, but with the pace and shooting with which Golden State played, other contenders ended up downsizing their lineups and traditional bigs got run off the floor vs. the Warriors. Now, we are seeing more teams swing back the other way. The Sixers will roll out a lineup featuring Simmons at PG and Horford/Embiid at the 4 and 5. The Lakers will start LeBron at PG and AD/Dwight at the 4 and 5 because Anthony Davis is scared to guard centers. The Bucks and Giannis will also force teams to play a bit bigger and attempt to stuff the paint. The Magic have a ton of length. Against certain teams, the Raptors will start both Ibaka and Gasol. Obviously, some teams like the Rockets (WB/Harden/EG) and Warriors (Curry/DLo/Klay) will go small to suit their personnel but leaguewide the trend is going back towards big lineups.

After the China conflict boils down, we'll look back and realize that r/nba was too harsh on everyone involved. It's not the job of players or other people in the league to be social justice warriors and escalate tensions with a foreign country. I think Silver should take a stronger stance and support his employee's freedom of speech, but overall he's doing a good job of de-escalating tensions with a large market. The players shouldn't be expected to discuss China the way we want. It's not their job and they've clearly been told by higher personnel to not discuss the situation at all with the press.

I've tried posting about this in [r/nba](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/) but it's been removed every time, which is in itself concerning. I wonder how many posts they are censoring about the NBA/Hong Kong story.

My main point is that any appeal to ignorance from Steve Kerr about the Hong Kong situation, as he has claimed in recent interviews, is clearly disingenuous. He felt well-informed enough to have an opinion about Hong Kong on September 17th, and nothing has substantively changed since then. Except, of course, now the NBA is being directly impacted. This goes beyond just Steve Kerr though. Most people in the NBA are being similarly quiet. Is the NBA is explicitly directing players/coaches to deflect questions about the situation, or has Steve Kerr (along with others) decided that speaking up on this topic isn't worth the backlash it would cause? In either case, I think this is reminder that speaking up about social issues is much easier when insulated from any direct consequences of speaking out.

Inb4 TL;DR, CSB, ""nice new account, paid CCP bot"" etc. I mean yea, a bot sat down w/ Ernest Hemingway &amp; wrote all this. I don't know (or frankly care) how to prove I have no horse in the CCP-HK intramural skirmish, but it's not like my previous Reddit accounts created pro hoc had much activity to speak of. And before the deluge of downvotes that will conclusively DEMOLISH my theses, I'll even stipulate to the collective wisdom of the Reddit crowd: Morey was a “true hero” who did the “objectively” “morally right” thing to “speak up” for “human rights,” political autonomy, etc etc etc. Yada yada yada.
2. Stated at that level of generality, who can fault him for that? Yet the same people who would characterize his lone tweet as a beacon of courage then decry Silver, Fertitta, Kerr, Popovich, Harden, Westbrook, Giannis, Curry, half a dozen ESPN hosts, &amp; countless others for making mealy-mouthed, vacuous platitudes. Even granting that that's an apt characterization of their statements, platitudes don't come any more meaningless than “doing the right thing for human rights.”
3. Maybe Silver &amp; Fertitta strong-armed Morey into deleting his heroic tweet &amp; apologizing, but if so then Morey evidently also cared more about retaining his job than “standing firm for human rights.”
4. But didn’t Morey shine an overdue spotlight on the HK predicament via his (now-deleted) Tweet? And didn’t Fertitta &amp; China clumsily Streisand-ing Morey’s original point? If they did, why haven’t you heard a single peep about “human rights” or “democracy” in HK as this mess has unfolded? Not from Morey, not Silver, no one. Instead it’s now all about the \*second-order\* reactions to Morey. Across Silver’s 37 statements to date, he never once mentions HK or even human rights. Instead he’s retreated to the more defensible (but still murky &amp; contested) ground of “free speech.”  The same phenomenon occurred w/ the NFL &amp; the National Anthem. Kneelers attracted attention, no doubt, but not to their purported original underlying cause. That ""national dialogue"" actually faded into the background as the dispute morphed into patriotism for the troops. Likewise here: Freedom of speech, not freedom from police brutality or military incursion, has now become the line Redditors are demanding Silver to hold.
5. Silver initially came on this trip w/ the NBA’s 4 most star-studded teams to continue to build the NBA’s reach (&amp; do some good for charities &amp; the Special Olympics). Those appearances were cancelled, &amp; now Silver, Fertitta, &amp; crew are praying they can appease a foreign state apparatus to salvage a $4B burgeoning market from going up in smoke. A market that Stern, Silver, &amp; crew have devoted the last quarter-century to nurturing. They’ll be sitting across from a foreign state apparatus that, incidentally, is every bit as cunning &amp; ruthless as infallible Redditors say it is.
6. What’s more, the NBA’s outreach trip has coincided w/ Activision-Blizzard, Disney, &amp; Nike coming down like 300 tons of bricks. Heck, after witnessing this spectacle, the other 497 F500 companies probably will treat HK as if it’s radioactive &amp; steer clear. After all this, is HK even an inch closer to having its “demands” met? Of course, HK can always rely on 2 Heads-of-State united by their golden hair &amp; their shared commitment to human rights to deliver salvation.
7. Meanwhile, Silver, LeBron, Fertitta, the other 29 owners, &amp; pretty much every star and benchwarmer you can think of—none of them are rushing to pat Morey on the back for “embodying the essence of the NBA’s core value of free speech &amp; expression” (or whatever, as their prominence, collective revenue, team salary caps, &amp; individual bank accounts all shrink). To boot, they can't wait to thank Morey for entangling them in an unforced, self-initiated slugfest w/ Senators ranging from Liz Warren to Ted Cruz and, inescapably, the Chief Executive of our Nation's Laws (lol).
8. And Reddit appears to romanticize that the American fan-base to a person sees as vividly as Reddit does the moral righteousness of HK's cause. From there, all it takes to change EVERYONE’s tune is a NBALP cancellation here or a choreographed chant of “We Stand w/ HK/Morey” there. But just like in Philadelphia, they'll soon discover that 95%+ of the NBA's audience who actually sit in NBA arenas' seats DGAF about \[any given social issue\], least of all ""human rights"" on the other side of the globe. They'll tell the protestors (brave as they are) to STFU so they can see the action on the court unobstructed. Then they'll get security to promptly show the protestors the door.
9. But, even if the NBA &amp; NBPA silently seeth about how 25+ years of effort &amp; $4B+ vanished in a flash, they can’t ever deny that Darryl Morey had done (but then immediately undid by deleting) the “morally right thing for human rights.” No one can take that paper ring away from Morey. I mean just lol.
10. Proof's in the pudding, &amp; judging by the latest reactions from Steph (&amp; Harden, v3) decreed from Silver himself, the ""take a stand"" crowd at bottom knows as well as I do  that 5 days, weeks, months, or years from now, Hong Kong will be no freer, no less oppressed, &amp; no better supported by the ""international community"" in HK's righteous yet futile pursuit of ""demands"" everyone knows full well the CCP will never so much as entertain, much less accept.",True,False,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,67257,public,self,So how has Morey's heroism advanced Hong Kong's cause?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/dfr3l4/so_how_has_moreys_heroism_advanced_hong_kongs/,,,,,,,,,,,1570758620.0,,,,,
