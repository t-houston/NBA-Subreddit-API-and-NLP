TL;DR I created a new ""stat/rating"" to compare players. I believe this works for NBA and NFL players, and i have yet to test it on NHL, Soccer data but i believe it will hold for that as well. If you want to read a bit about how it works go on a head, otherwise you can skip down to the tables. If you want my data it's all from NBA basketball reference and i can provide my excel sheet but it's just a bunch of formulas and averages that you can do for yourself to check as well.

I rarely post on reddit, but i think i've created something that will be useful for you nephews to settle debates once and for all. We all know the GOAT debate and everyone has different opinions, so this was designed with the goal of being able to ""prove"" how much influence a player has. This is why it's called X-Factor. I haven't gone through many years of data. However, i took Steph Curry's MVP year as a baseline to see if it would work, and the answer will shock you (unless you understand how the rating is supposed to be used, which i will explain).

Basically this is how x-factor is supposed to be used: going on the premise that the ""average"" player in a league deserves to be there, how do we determine who's average? Furthermore, how do we quantify a ""superstars"" influence? I took the average of 435 NBA players (all players who played over a total of 82 minutes in the season for an average of at least 1 min/game). Now how do we ""compare"" say LeBron James to the average player? If you include LeBron' stats in the average, then it will be skewed because LeBron is included. So X-Factor will remove LeBron's stat's from the sum, find the ""new average"" of the remaining 434 players, and then do a simple ratio comparing LeBron's stats to that.

For example: The TOTAL AVERAGE of points scored by a player in the 15-16 NBA season was 579(.032) points. The sum total of 435 players was 251,879 then divide by 435 to get that average. However, LeBron obviously contributed to that total with 1,920 of his own points. So we subtract 1920 from 251879 to get 249,959 and a NEW AVERAGE of 575.942 points. So you see how LeBron actually skews the average UP by 4 points by himself. This is important because this is how X-Factor will work. Instead of comparing LeBron's 1920 to 579 (which would give an ""X-Factor"" of 3.316) we compare his total to the average of players that do not include him which would be 575.942 (which gives an ""X-Factor"" of 3.333).

So X-Factor is basically a standard deviation ish type stat or rating, that compares a players production to the average of players that do not include that player, and then takes the average of all of those ratings. So I found the X-Factors of a bunch of important stats such as Points, FG, FGA, Reb, etc and then when you take the average of those X-Factors you get the ""Total X-Factor Rating"".

Formatting on reddit is pretty awful, so without further ado here's the X-Factor ratings of the top 11 players of 2015-2016:


Players|X-Factor
:--|--:
James Harden|3.14
Stephen Curry|2.98
Russell Westbrook|2.74
Kevin Durant|2.61
DeMarcus Cousins|2.58
Paul George|2.58
Andre Drummond|2.57
LeBron James|2.50
Paul Millsap|2.41
Damian Lillard|2.40
Kyle Lowry|2.35

Looking at this table i'm sure there's objections. And that's exactly why i chose to present this year to further show how this rating works:

Everyone knows Curry's unanimous MVP season was incredible and he often sat out many 4th Quarters. This is the main reason why James Harden has a higher X-Factor Rating. That year Steph played 2700 mins, Russ and KD played 2750 and 2578 respectively.. Harden played 3125 minutes. Almost the equivalent of 8 full games, which gave Harden much more opportunity to score, and he used that opportunity to score 2376 total points to Steph Curry's 2375.

However, you can't just dismiss the fact that Harden played and (barely) scored more. It still counted in the record books and to decide games so it should be included here. But let me explain what that X-Factor number is: the MOST AVERAGE PLAYER POSSIBLE will score pretty much exactly a 1.00 on this scale. That player in this data is Patrick Patterson with an X-Factor of 1.001. Below him are players like Trevor Booker, Corey BRewer and Justise Winslow and above him are Andrew Bogut, Mario Chalmers, etc. So this is still a pretty good indication of an ""average"" player as well. This stat basically is saying that Steph Curry's influence was 3x that of Patrick Patterson's for the year. And 3x an average player is quite impressive. But looking at that above table there's not many people who could argue that those players did not deserve to be in a top 10 discussion at the time and there's others just outside the top like Kemba, KAT, and Wall who could be honorable mentions as well.

This Rating isn't perfect. nothing truly is, but being able to accurately compare players like this will be very helpful in the future. You can also compare how much more ""of an X-Factor"" Steph was to Russ by comparing 2.98/2.74 for a ratio of 1.088 or you could say Steph's season was 8.8% better in a roundabout way.

This can be broken down to only compare by positions as well, as Steph's 3 point X-factor rating will be skewed greatly when he's taking 886 3's in a season and he's being included with players like DeAndre Jordan who only attempted one for the whole season.

I would really like to hear some feedback, whether it be positive or negative, as i think this could really be fine-tuned to not only ""settle debates"" but also help these players in negotiations as well. If Steph Curry can say ""i deserve to be paid 3x the average player according to this rating"" and can back it up then that should be what he's worth. It also will be able to show players what they need to work on to improve. For example James Harden had a TOTAL turnover number of 374 (for an X-Factor rating of -3.85) to Steph Curry's 262 (for an X-Factor Rating of -2.40). So teams could also say ""work on your turnover numbers first before we consider paying you more"" or it could be used for incentives/bonuses.

This rating also gives one clear concise number that includes every stat you could possible want to use to compare players. To arrive at this one X-Factor rating i took the averages of all X-Factor ratings for: Points, FG, FGA, 2/3P/PA, FT, FTA, ORB, DRB, TRB, AST, STL, BLK, TOV).

With team rosters and lineups starting to coalesce ahead of training camp, we can start to make some safe assumptions about the way this regular season plays out. (These assumptions are proven wrong frequently, but that's showbiz)

Looking at the Pelicans roster, I'm seeing an excellent mix of young talent - Zion, Lonzo, Hart, Ingram, Hayes, Alexander-Walker, and Jackson and established league veterans in Holiday, Reddick, Favors, Moore and Miller. 

Most books have them between 32 and 37 wins, and I simply cannot see a likely scenario (barring injuries) that results in this team being awful. The top 7 rotation players are all long, excellent defenders outside of Reddick, and the roster has no clear weaknesses. 

Even if rookie year Zion is more of an athletic utility player (think Montrezl Harrell or young Shawn Marion) this season, he should be a great on and off court fit. Many number one picks with a major pedigree demand the ball - Zion is the ultimate team player, and has expressed interest in the Draymond role that David Griffen envisions for him while the rest of his game develops.

Brandon Ingram has shown that a 20ppg season as a featured scorer is very realistic, after averaging 18ppg on 48% from the field last season. More encouragingly, he played his best basketball as the year went on before sitting out due to clotting issues.

Lonzo Ball may never be more than an average scorer, but his passing, defense and rebounding can provide exactly what this team needs. Jrue Holiday prefers to play SG, and will thrive in a role that allows him to switch every screen with Lonzo defensively and focus on scoring instead of distributing on the other end. Lonzo pushes the ball in transition and often starts his own breaks with defensive rebounds.

Derrick Favors is a veteran, but only 28 years old. Forced into playing the 4 in Utah, his best minutes have come at his natural center position. Big, strong and athletic, Favors consistently averages about 16 points, 11 rebounds and 2.5 blocks per 36 minutes. He will help Zion avoid taking on too much defensively, and provide the type of rim protection that a run and gun team needs to be successful in the modern NBA.

Other young players like Jaxson Hayes and Nickeil Alexander Walker played above expectations at summer league and provide quality depth and lineup options for Alvin Gentry. Guys like Hart and Moore are more than capable of playing solid defense and hitting open 3s when called upon.

Another underrated aspect - chemistry. This team has proven winners across the board, and guys that have often been regarded as excellent team mates at every stop. Holiday and Reddick should be the leaders in the locker room, and many of the Pelicans are already well acquainted through the Duke pipeline.

So let's get into it.

Fox stats (slash line rounded): 17/7/4. 50% eFG, 54% TS, 37% on 3s at 3 attempts a game, 0.378 free throw rate, 5.6 win shares, 1.1 BPM, 2.0 VORP, 1.7 PIPM, 1.82 RPM.

Doncic stats (slash line rounded):  21/6/8. 50% eFG, 54.5% TS, 33% on 3s at 7 attempts per game, 0.409 FTr, 4.9 win shares, 4.1 BPM, 3.6 VORP, 1.4 PIPM, 1.29 RPM. 

Takeaways from the numbers: Fox shot much better over the past season than most expected, but Luka's vastly higher number of attempts and range make his shooting, to me, more valuable for spacing and warping of the defense. Of the advanced stats, I think PIPM and RPM, as per usual, do a better job of capturing how close this is right now than the pure box stats, with dRPM really punishing Luka (-1) and accounting for the difference in RPM overall.

Now that we (with some help from the impact metrics) have seen that right now both guys have about the same overall impact on their team, I would like to make a few comments about their games.

Fox and Doncic are both quite good passers for how young they are. From watching them both a decent amount, it seems to me that Luka is a better pure passer, making better reads out of the PnR and manipulating the defense with his vision more(not that Fox doesn't do these things, Doncic just seems to do them better). Doncic probably sees the game about a half step ahead of where Fox does at this point in time. 

Not so fast, though. While Luka is probably the better pure passer, passing very much depends on creating separation from your man, breaking down the defense, and creating opportunities for your teammates that no amount of vision can will into existence. This separation is an area where Luka struggles and Fox excels. I do not know how to index Ben Taylor's creation stat in a way that allows me to report it here, but if anyone else does I would really appreciate it. Overall, Fox's ability to destroy a defensive game plan with his athleticism, create chaos and attendant opportunities for his team like a young Westbrook, cause me to lean towards Fox as an overall playmaker at this point in their very young careers. 

One other important aspect that is even more difficult to quantify is the infamous gravity of a good shooter. Luka shoots how people think Trae Young shoots: often, pretty well, and from anywhere. As his Hardenesque attempts and style suggest, Luka is a threat that forces the defense to bend in various directions. As the talent around him improves, this spacing only becomes more valuable and probably gives Luka an ability to play with other great players that I'm not sure Fox has. 

Given that this is getting pretty long at this point, and what I take to be the biggest strength of both players has been discussed at some length, I would like to comment quickly on their biggest weaknesses. 

Fox has almost no right hand to speak of, and while his sheer athleticism allows him to work around this in the regular season, playoff game plans will likely expose this if the Kings make the playoffs any time soon. Harden took a considerable amount of time to overcome this entirely, and even now is only able to completely because teams are so afraid of his stepback 3--an avenue that seems unlikely to be available to Fox. 

Bringing that pretty bad -1 dRPM back into focus for Luka highlights his biggest deficiency. He doesn't seem to be a bad defender like Trae Young or even a mostly disinterested one like Booker, but his horizontal foot speed prevents him from guarding shiftier players. Doncic is a competent rebounder but lacks the strength to defend larger players. The technique isn't terrible for Doncic, but he it does need to be cleaned up. Over time, my bet is Doncic gets stronger and more technically skilled and Dallas can hide him on smaller 4s and less mobile 3s without hurting the team defense and maybe even using his high BBIQ to be a positive. Fox on the other hand has a clear defensive identity: he can guard the opposing point and be a nuisance with his quick hands and leaping ability.
He too needs to bulk up as stronger points can bully him near the basket, but that is pretty much a given for 21 year olds with his frame.

I've been thinking about this for a while and find it difficult to determine, and is why im posting here for more of a discussion than just an answer.

Its easy to pick a player whose had monster assist numbers in the past like Rondo, Westbrook, CP3, Wall etc. but then you would be neglecting some players who have that all around elite passing game but dont display it to the same volume due to the system they're in e.g. Curry, Rubio. 

Some players would be better in certain areas than others - Love throws the best full court passes, Jokic the best lead passes and Harden has arguably become the best pnr passer. 

So it begs the question who would be the best all round passer, from being able to accurately deliver simple chest, bounce and high passes to the more advanced lobs, full court, cross court, no look and to a degree flashy passes.

In actuality, the team was able to bolster their roster while maintaining long-term cap flexibility. Their plans for championship contention in 2019 were undoubtedly foiled, but if the FO proves competent, they are setting themselves up to be one of the most attractive free agency destinations in 2021. 
 
In the past 20 years the Knicks have issued egregious contracts to players like Joakim Noah, Stefon Marbury, and Eddy Curry,setting the franchise back a number of years. With $70 million in cap space, many expected the Knicks to continue their old ways and chase borderline all stars left on the market. After striking out on Durant and Irving, however, President Steve Mills and GM Scott Perry made apparent the impending culture shock facing the Big Apple. An alternative plan was devised: sign role players to short-term contracts to allow future max space. The Knicks have publicized their intent to build through the draft; Head Coach David Fizdale made it a priority to connect with the incoming players. If they want to acquire star free agents, they have to implement a winning climate first.
 
As free agency closes, the Knicks have completely revamped their roster by adding Randle, Ellington, Bobby Portis, Reggie Bullock, Taj Gibson, Marcus Morris, and Elfrid Payton. Not only should the effect be noticed immediately on the court, but differences off court could be all the more valuable. Veterans Gibson, Morris, and Ellington should assume a leadership role, providing mentorship that can’t be measured in a stat-sheet to a locker room full of a young core aspiring to be future faces of the franchise. 
 
Aside from Randle, no player is guaranteed past 2021 with 5 players set for a team option in 2020. These team friendly contracts allow for complete freedom to build the roster in any direction they’d like. Whether they decide to flip the expiring deals for future assets, try and re-negotiate the contracts, or let them walk in hopes of acquiring a superstar, the possibilities are endless for a team that seemingly had no direction post-Porzingis.

I understand it's quite inhumane to refer to older players as depreciating assets and it's certainly terse to communicate to players that they are worth less by the end of their contract than more, but in the NBA market that is what they are. I feel as though teams would prefer older players to be on depreciating deals and that would make the player more flexible to be moved be it at the behest of the team or the player's request.

There's definitely differences between Wall/Beal and Dame/CJ, but it's safe to say that their backcourts are the main investment. 

At the same time management and roster construction for the teams are much different. While both front offices overpaid guys in the summer of 2016, the money was spent in different ways.

Portland paid $10M to Meyers Leonard, $17M to Evan Turner, $19M to Allen Crabbe, $9M to Moe Harkless, and $8M to Festus Ezeli(all per year salaries, rounded up). Washington $16M to Ian Mahinmi,$5M to Jason Smith, $7M to Andrew Nicholson and traded a second round pick for Trey  Burke.

Both teams shelled out money, but Portland paid their young guys (Meyers Leonard turned down more money) in the hope that at least one would cash in and develop into a rotation player on a winning team. Evan Turner got starter money because he was starter caliber, if not full time starter. Crabbe wasn't great, but had decent value because he was still young (this was before CJ signed for his new deal).

Washington spent money on seasoned veterans, two of which were Centers. Mahinmi was recovering from injury most of the season (he played 14 minutes in a game before February). Nicholson was not able to earn minutes and was already a few years in the league (he was 27 at the time, with 4 years of experience), so they traded him and a first round pick to Brooklyn, for Bojan Bogdanovic. Bogdanovic was effective as an offensive weapon, but it cost Washington a first round pick. Brooklyn used it to select Jarrett Allen, a young C that suited Washington. Trey Burke was on the last year of his rookie deal and didn't play much, wasting Washington's second round pick (it wasn't Trey Burke's fault).

During the 2017 offseason, Portland traded Allen Crabbe for Andrew Nicholson, but then stretched his contract. They also drafted Zach Collins and Caleb Swanigan, and inked in a new deal for CJ.

Washington supermaxed Wall (at the time he earned), but that wasn't going to kick in for a couple more seasons. Washington chose Otto Porter over Bojan Bogdanovic. Brooklyn offered Porter a max (I thought it was a brilliant move on their part, knowing Washington's situation), but Washington matched because they needed Otto. They had to sit on their hands through the next draft, leaving the team with very little youth to develop. They also signed Mike Scott and Jodie Meeks to minimum deals (Meeks had a second year player option).

The next season rolled around. Portland fared better, while Washington snuck into the playoffs as an 8 seed. Both teams were eliminated in the first round. 

Last summer, Portland had room to re-sign Jusef Nurkic to a team friendly deal at $11M, and Nik Stauskus for a minimum deal. They drafted guard, Anfernee Simmons as well.

Washington reloaded with minimum contracts to Dwight Howard and Jeff Green. Jodie Meeks opted in as well (but was suspended due to a rule violation). They traded Marcin Gortat to the Clippers, for Austin Rivers. Rivers was on the last year of his deal and due $12M. Washington also picked up Thomas Bryant, still on his rookie deal and drafted guard, Troy Brown. That set up Washington to start the season with *8* guys on expiring contracts (Markieff Morris, Kelly Oubre, Tomas Satoransky, Austin Rivers, Jeff Green, Thomas Bryant, Jason Smith and Jodie Meeks. 9, if you count Dwight's second year player option). 

Portland left themselves with room to continue building, as they traded Stauskus, Wade Baldwin and a pick for Rodney Hood, and Caleb Swanigan for Skal Labisserie. Washington had to a few deals after a poor start to the season such as:

- Jodie Meeks to Milwaukee, for a pick
- Jason Smith and the recently acquired pick to Milwaukee for Sam Dekker (part of a three team deal)
-Kelly Oubre and Austin Rivers to Phoenix, for Trevor Ariza
-Markieff Morris and a second round pick to the Pelicans, for Wesley Johnson 

Washington thought adding veteran defensive players would fix the defense. That didnt happen and Wall went out for injury/surgery. After announcing they would keep Otto Porter, Washington traded him before the deadline to Chicago, for Jabari Parker, Bobby Portis and a pick. Once again they were left with over 5 guys on expiring contracts, but they really shuffled the deck chairs and lost their youth.

So, what's the point?

Many times I read posts and articles, or watch videos about how much blame should be lumped onto Wall and how much praise placed onto Lillard. 

Lillard is a great leader. On court he fits in to the direction the NBA is heading with more perimeter shooting. Not to mention he's improved every year. 

Wall isn't a bad leader. The feud with Gortat went both ways. Gortat created opportunities for others with his screen setting, but Wall assisted him for a majority of his scoring. Wall and Beal said that they don't **always** see eye to eye, but  it wasn't signs of trouble between them.

Overall, I think Portland created a solid environment for Lillard to thrive, and made wise personnel decisions. A majority of moves they've made, and continue to make, build the team. 

Washington, on the other hand, kept making decisions to cancel out the good ones. It caught up with them big team leading to a huge blowout at practice last fall. It became easier to see Wall's flaws (playing through injury or not) when so much more is going wrong. Admittedly, his play since signing the supermax hasn't been great, but the lack of depth shows how much they rely on him. There were moments of the team playing better without Wall, but it didn't last long. 

Washington's front office seems to get it so far. We'll see if it continues. And, Wall absolutely needs to cut back on forcing bad shots. He's got Beal and Thomas Bryant, who can initiate offense. Troy Brown and Rui Hachimura too. 

Hoping Lillard and Wall both can lead their teams far.

B: Ben Simmons - I am extremely high on Ben Simmons, and believe that he (with or without Embiid) will win multiplte titles this upcoming decade. I also believe that maybe even as soon as next season, Simmons will pass Embiid as the best player on the 76ers.  Simmons is one of the best passers in the history of the league already, and is a 6'10'' point guard. If he gets a jumpshot, he will no doubt be on the first team, and even if he doesn't I still think he will be good enough in all other aspects of the game.

B: Luka Doncic - Luka is one of the best rookies in recent memory, and it could be a little early to put him on this list, but I believe that I've seen enough to know that he will dominate the 2020s. He already has the keys to an entire franchise, and the Mavericks will treat him like the next Dirk. Luka is a perfect example of what a guard should be in the modern NBA, and I believe he will become a worldwide superstar.

F: Giannis Antetokounmpo - This was probably the easiest decision of the entire team. Giannis has already won an MVP, and i believe he will win at least 2 more MVPs in the next few years, maybe even more. Giannis has already proven himself to be one of the  best players in the league at age 24, so this is a no brainer to me.

F: Nikola Jokic - Jokic has already shown signs that he is an MVP level player, and I believe he will take the Nuggets deep into the playoffs year after year. Jokic is already the best passing big man we've ever seen, and his scoring will only improve from here. his defense will need to improve for him to be first team, but with the improvement he's shown already, I believe he will become a good, if not great, defender because of his IQ.

F: Karl-Anthony Towns - KAT will have a Kevin Garnett type of decade, and not just because he's on the Timberwolves. I think he spend most of the decade with this Timberwolves teams, putting up incredible numbers on the way to a first or second round exit with maybe one conference finals appearance. Towards the end of the decade, KAT will get tired of being on a losing team, and will get himself a ring as the second or maybe even first best player on another team. Those numbers, and especially if he wins a ship, will propel him to first team.

2nd team

B: Ja Morant - This is probably a pretty controversial pick, as Ja hasn't even played in an NBA game yet. I am extremely high on Ja, and definitely believe he will be the best player in this draft. Ja is like a better shooting, higher IQ, more under control version of Russell Westbrook. I also think with him not being very highly recruited, and going to a mid-major school, he will embrace turning a lower market franchise around in the Grizzlies. I believe the Grizzlies will become a great team towards the middle of the decade and will win at least 1 championship towards the end (this also plays into one of my other rankings). 

B: Kyrie Irving - It's hard to believe that Kyrie is still only 27 years old. I'm not too high on Kyrie as a leader, but damn he is talented. No matter what happens with KD post-injury, it will be good for Kyrie's ranking on this list. If KD comes back like the same KD pre-injry, he will most likely lead the Nets to a couple championships, and Kyrie will possibly be considered the best sidekick of all time. If KD just isn't the same post-injury, Kyrie will be the best player on a Nets team that could contend for a championship, and will be very good for years to come. I could see Kyrie not making one of the all-decade teams if he has too big of an ego to make it work with Durant, but they are great friends so I think it will work out.

F: Anthony Davis - Davis is one of the most talented big men in the league, and this will continue for most of the 2020's. A lot of his ranking may depend on A) how many titles him and LeBron win in LA and B) whether or not he was the best player on those Lakers teams. I personally don't believe he will surpass LeBron until at least 2 more years, and I don't think the Lakers will win more than 1 championship, but he could definitely prove me wrong, and beat out Jokic or Kawhi for the first team. Either way, AD will make one of the all decade teams.

F: Kawhi Leonard - It is so tough not putting Kawhi on first team, but I just can't do it with his age (28). I believe Kawhi will win the next two NBA championships, but he will only be great until 2026 or maybe 2027. He will go down as the greatest perimeter defender ever, but his age and lack of games played (load management) will just hold him back from first team.

F: Joel Embiid - I know most people will probably have Embiid as first team all decade, but with his history of injuries, and how good I believe Ben Simmons will be, I just don't see it. I believe that Ben Simmons will pass Embiid as the best player on the 76ers in the next 2 years, and Embiid will have too big of an ego to accept this and will leave the 76ers to be on a lesser team. Even if he doesn't leave, it will be extremely tough to make the first team while being the second best player on your team for most of the decade. He will no doubt put up incredible numbers no matter where he is, but he will never be able to play an entire season, and this will hurt his case for first team even more.

&amp;#x200B;

3rd team

B: De'Aaron Fox - Fox is already a great point guard in the league, and he will only continue to get better with time. The Kings are heading in the right direction, and Fox will be the guy for them for years to come. He is a great defender and distributor, and a good scorer, and at the age of 21, he's not even close to his prime.

B: Stephen Curry - I really debated having Curry over Kyrie for the second team, but with him being 31, I don't think he'll be able to sustain his greatness for the entire decade. Curry could very well win MVP this upcoming season if the Warriors do well enough in the standings. Curry's play style will allow him to play at a high level for much longer than most NBA players. He is already the greatest shooter ever, and will go on to destroy records in the next few years, but his age is what holds him back from being higher.

F: Paul George - I think the Clippers will win the next two championships with PG and Kawhi, and Paul George will continue to be great for most of the decade. PG's defense and shooting will allow him to be a good player, even into his late 30's.

F: Pascal Siakam - This is definitely a controversial pick, but with Kawhi gone, Pascal will have his own team, and I believe he will show that he is capable of being the best player on a great team making an all-star team this year, and an all-NBA team the next year. He has already shown signs of being great, and he is a prototype for what power forwards should be in the modern NBA. He can shoot, defend, handle the ball, make plays for his teammates, and most importantly he has an insane work ethic.

F: Jaren Jackson Jr. - This will easily be the most unpopular pick, but hear me out. Jaren Jackson has shown elite potential in just his first NBA season. Jaren is already one of the best defenders in the league. He can defend low post, switch out on guards, and he gets steals and blocks. Jaren can already shoot the ball, and has shown an ability to handle. Again, this was all in his first season. My belief that Ja Morant will be one of the best point guards in the league for years to come will help Jackson greatly. I believe that these two players will lead the Grizzlies to a championship down the road. Jaren Jackson will be like a Draymond that can average 20 ppg.

Honorable Mentions

Damian Lillard - great scorer, won't be on a championship team, and Fox is younger.

Victor Oladipo - If he comes back from his injury even better than before, then he could pass Fox or Curry.

Donovan Mitchell - It is extremely close between him and Fox, but Fox is just better at everything except scoring.

Devin Booker - Can only score.

Bradley Beal - Just got beat out.

James Harden - Will be like Kobe last decade, but without the championship.

Russell Westbrook - Too old for his play style to continue working.

LeBron James - He's almost 35, but it's LeBron so he could prove me wrong.

Kevin Durant - Will be 32 when he comes back from injury. Would easily be on second team if not for the injury. Still almost put him on third team.

Zion Williamson - won't be a bust, but won't be a franchise player that people are expecting him to be. He will always be a highlight machine, but he has an extremely high risk for injury and is undersized and overweight.

For example, the Warriors run a lot of motion offense with guys like Steph and Klay running around off ball with other plays setting a ton of screens for them to get open. This might be subject to change based on the roster this year but this is how it has been lately.

I'm pretty sure we also know about the Rockets and how their strategy is to have Harden isolate and score or break down the defense and lob to Capela or dish it out to an outside shooter. Bucks are similar as well. Beyond that I can't say I know too many others.

The NBA implemented the 3 point shot in the 1979-80 season. Through the first 7 years of shooting 3 pt shots, the NBA never averaged above .282% in a season while during the same time frame the ABA never averaged below .283% with twice as many attempts. The NBA got off to a 'hot' start shooting .280% from the three in season one. But the next four years saw the shooting percentage above .25% only once. Then there began a surging that allowed the 3 point shooting percentage to bust through the .300 barrier in 86-87 by ending at .301. Then it was .316 the next season and the .35% level would eventually get broken at the end of the 94-95 season and generally stayed around .350% since then. So it took the NBA 16 seasons to be able to top .350% as a league and topping .350% as a league was something the ABA never did during its nine year existence. So there's a combined twenty-five seasons to break the .350% barrier from the three point line.

1994-95 was not only the first year the NBA shot above .350% from the three point line but the attempts were up noticeably, from 9.9 the year before to 15.3 - which was the first year attempts per game hit double digits for either league.

Dark blue is really good; dark red is really bad. 

##**Methodology**

I downloaded every shot from the 2018-19 regular season and calculated each players points per shot by the distance from the hoop. In other words, I calculated how many points a 0 foot shot was worth on average for each player, how many points a 1 foot shot was worth on average for each player, how many points a 2 foot shot was worth on average for each player, and so on and so forth. 

[This chart](https://imgur.com/a/quYD4HC) shows the top 30 players in points per game from the regular season and their points per shot in 1ft increments (between 0 and 35 feet). Volume is represented by the height of the chart. 

So you can see Giannis took a bunch of shots between 0 and 1 feet and was very efficient at the rim. Meanwhile, Buddy Hield took most of his shots from three and was very efficient with those attempts. 

##**Limitations**

This chart does not incorporate shooting fouls. So this chart would underestimate the points per shot for a player who drew a lot of shooting fouls and had a high free throw percentage -- for example, James Harden. 

##**Data Source**

I used the [nbastatR](https://github.com/abresler/nbastatR) package to download the shot data and used ggplot2 to make this chart.

Quick refresher on the criteria I'm using

* **Only Players Who Were Selected In the Lotto Era are Eligible**

* **So only players selected from 1985 on are eligible for this exercise. (See previous posts for more explanation as to why)**
  * Only 16 teams will be created, 1 team for each lotto pick and 2 additional teams representing picks 15-30 and the second round

* **Positions and Peak is Taken into Account**

  * Each player is assumed to be at their absolute peak of their powers
Here is a link to a Google Doc that will house all the stats/accolades for each team that has been posted (so far picks #1-#14), and here are the list of the prior posts.

I love this starting lineup so much, mainly because prime [Manu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48WnPHE2dKk) and [Jokic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DHo_wG2YQk) playing together would just be a thing of beauty. The passes we would see between those two would just be unreal, I feel like they might be basketball soulmates and would produce some of the most aesthetically pleasing basketball I can imagine.  

Then if that wasn't good enough we have two all time lunatic/basketball geniuses in Arenas and Rodman who would either be best friends or kill each other (and that's not even bringing in Draymond on the bench), but either way it would be incredible. Rodman is a perfect pairing next to Jokic, he doesn't quite have the rim protection that Jokic needs, but his defensive and rebounding prowess and his ability to be a top caliber player without having the ball is perfect for this starting lineup. A pairing of Jokic and Rodman would just gobble up every rebound, most teams would really struggle keeping them off the boards. Offensive rebounding would be deadly this team, especially with three shooters. 

Prime Arenas would be perfect for the league today, he was memorizing in his prime and his ability to breakdown any defense cannot be overstated. Redd is a perfect pairing for Ginobili and Arenas, a great shooter who must be guarded tightly by defenses on any Ginobili or Arenas drive or it's an automatic 3. This lineup has a lot of shooting, a lot of scoring, and while it may lack a lock down perimeter defender or elite rim protector there are really savvy defenders in Arenas, Ginbili, and Jokic (who is not as bad on defense as his reputation would lead you to believe) and then an All-Time great defender in Rodman. The shooting, passing, and rebounding with this starting unit makes it really, really hard to beat.  

A few thoughts with constructing the rest of the roster: 


****
* The list of players who didn't make the cut is pretty long so I'll keep it to my hardest omissions:

 * Jeff Hornacek
 * P.J. Brown
 * Uncle Cliffy
 * Carlos Boozer
 * Kyle Korver
 * Danny Green
 * Trevor Ariza
 * Toni Kukoc
 * Lou Williams
 * Mehmet Okur
 * Cuttino Mobley
 * Goran Dragic
 * Monta Ellis
 * Marcin Gortat
 

* Hornacek, Korver, Green, Boozer, and Cliff Robinson were hard omissions, but they all kind of had a slightly better comp on the team already. Rashard Lewis may be worse on defense, but he's a better shooter and brings a lot of the same skills to the table as Uncle Cliffy, but is slightly better at it. Korver, Hornacek, and Green are all great, great shooters who could easily have a place on this team. I felt that this team has good shooters throughout already and I like the peaks of Price and Thomas better than those three. Boozer was a really good player who became kind of a meme later on with his sprayed on hair and screaming ""**AND 1**"" everytime someone is around him, but he never brought the same defensive or offensive versatility that Millsap does. 

* I can see an argument for having Gasol as a starter over Jokic given Gasol's elite defense and great passing ability, but as much as I love Gasol it's pretty clear that Jokic is a generational type of talent that I just couldn't leave off of the starting lineup. But Gasol and Jordan are fantastic defenders off the bench, each capable of anchoring a defense and guarding elite bigs. This team has enough size to limit the #1 picks team greatest strength to a degree that would give this team a chance to compete. This team can also go from playing big to small fairly easily. A version of the death lineup with Arenas, Ginobili, Redd, Lewis/Millsap, and Draymond/Rodman would devastate teams. Green and Rodman could actually both play together with the spacing on this team and Draymond's passing ability. Those two might hate each other, but would wreck almost any offense they would face.  

* There isn't a ton of guard depth, Horny, Green, and Korver all have strong cases to be on this team, but I love either Price or Thomas running a bench unit. Mark Price is a long forgotten NBA player (except in every statistics textbook I've ever had) and is one of the all-time elite shooters. He could run a second unit with enough defenders that you wouldn't be too concerned about opposing teams guards. Thomas's injury problems is really sad, but that one season with the Celtics is so impressive. A unit of Thomas, Redd, Millsap, Lewis, and say Gasol would be really, really good with Gasol playing the Al Horford role and 3 guys who can defend and shoot. IT is a great heatcheck guy off the bench who can just go nuclear for 15-20 mins a night. 


****

What this squad lacks in elite athleticism or superstars it makes up for with shooting, elite defense, elite passing, and a tremendous feel for the game. This team can go big or play small and can matchup with almost any team in this field. I'm not sure if they would win, but they would compete against any team.

Jason Terry- Great shooter, smart passer, and a... present defender. People gave Dirk a lot of credit for the 2011 Mavs championship but forget what a monster Terry was in the playoffs. He spent most of his career as a sixth man, but given his ability to shoot and space the floor. 


Ray Allen- Could easily see him averaging over 30ppg per game with increased 3pt shooting. Super efficient player even in his time and underrated ball handler. He could play the 1 or 2 no problem and is still good sized for 2 even to this day.

Rashard Lewis- Ray's Sonic's teammate. Would be a perfect, versatile stretch 4 who can switch and guard any 2 or 3 in the league.

Rasheed Wallace- Big enough to play 4 or 5, was excellent on deep 2's so I assume he could make the adjustment out a couple more feet to 3. Good foul shooter. Would get A LOT less tech's in this age where players can literally scream in referee's faces.

Pau Gasol- Would be a much bigger matchup problem today even than his prime with his passing, ability to guard the paint, and rebound, in addition to his already very good offense.

I think a great possible solution to cheap ownership is to distribute a portion of the league’s luxury tax revenue to whichever team wins the NBA finals.  Here’s an idea of how it could work.

1. In order to actually receive luxury tax “winnings”, a franchise must win a championship in a year in which they pay luxury tax.

2. The amount can be adjusted but I think it should be in the 25-75% of the “luxury tax jackpot”. And if a franchise happens to pay more tax than would “win” under this method in a given year, the league gives said team a full tax rebate plus 10%

3. Should a non luxury tax paying team win the championship, they shall receive a consolation equal to the value of the most recent luxury tax Jackpot. While the rest of the luxury tax jackpot rolls into the luxury tax jackpot for the following year.  This can happen year after year with no limits.

Overall I think this could be a win-win-win.  

Obviously owners of contending teams have an opportunity to make more money than they normally would.  

The players win because of owners being willing to spend more money given that more teams would be willing to spend into the luxury tax.

And obviously the fans win because owners have a huge gain of incentive to produce a championship caliber team, encouraging them to make improvements at the margins required to win a championship rather than cutting corners to save a quick buck even during contention.

To give an example imagine how Robert Sarver would’ve managed his team during the Steve Nash era.  Do you think he would still trade draft picks for straight cash?  Obviously not because the financial gain of winning a chip heavily outweighs the revenue gained from such a trade. Or to think of something more recent, perhaps the Bucks wouldn’t have let Brogdon walk to avoid paying the tax.  Bottom line is that NBA franchises should not be making decisions that undoubtedly hurt the on court product, however they do so anyway because it can be more profitable to duck the tax than win a chip.

If you need to know who is on the roster (or rather who is left), it is [here](https://www.usab.com/mens/national-team/roster.aspx).

&amp;#x200B;

The Locks: Kemba Walker, Donovan Mitchell, Khris Middleton, Myles Turner, Harrison Barnes, maybe Kyle Lowry

**Kemba Walker** is the best player on the roster right now, so look for him to be the ""leader"" of the team. Additionally, him and **Donovan Mitchell** are the best scorers on the team, so watch for them to take on the bulk of the offensive load. **Khris Middleton** and **Myles Turner** are respectively the best wing and big on the roster and should have no problem making it to China. **Harrison Barnes** has left a bad taste to a number of people because of the 2016 Finals, but that doesn't take away the fact that he's a quality wing that is one of the only players with Olympic experience (albeit he barely played). In fact, I think he might start at the 4 for this squad.

**Kyle Lowry** is coming off another All-Star appearance, a championship run, and has his old college coach on the sidelines; his spot on the roster is secured. The only thing holding him back is his recovery from thumb surgery. That being said, I'm going to go on the positive side and say that he'll be ready to suit up when they get to China and act as a steady backup to Kemba.

The Other Bigs: Brook Lopez, Bam Adebayo

With guys like Nikola Jokic, Marc Gasol, and Rudy Gobert all slated to play, and with Giannis terrorizing the rim for Greece, it's a good idea to carry at least three bigs on the team. With Turner in, I'd imagine two of the Lopez-Adebayo-Plumlee trio to make it to China. Since Plumlee is definitely the worst of the three (and Coach K no longer at the helm), **Brook Lopez** and **Bam Adebayo** will probably make it.

Part of The Bench Mob: Jayson Tatum, De'Aaron Fox, Kyle Kuzma

After Khris Middleton, **Jayson Tatum** is the next best wing available so he should be able to make the team pretty easily so long as he cuts down on those mid-range jumpers and take advantage of the shorter three-point line. We need another guard, so this could come down to De'Aaron Fox and Marcus Smart. While one can certainly make the argument that Smart can more easily acquiesce into the gritty defender role that other USA teams have had in the past, I'm thinking that the team will want to use this spot for the up-and-coming star **De'Aaron Fox**. Smart is an all-world defender, but Fox is certainly no slouch, plus he offers much more offensively. Fox, I could imagine, might play a little bit of the role Russell Westbrook has done in International Competition, where he slides down to the 2 guard and defensively terrorizes the ball-handler with his athleticism and runs the fast break at will when he ends up with the ball.

The backup forward role might be the most interesting, with Jaylen Brown, Kyle Kuzma, and Thad Young all fighting for it. Brown may have the most potential, and Young may be the most steady, but I think **Kyle Kuzma** will ultimately end up winning a spot. Kuzma offers much needed scoring punch off the bench, and while not good defensively, at least offers up some versatility and size to justify his spot. Off the court, however, one could argue he might have the biggest name on the roster because of his LA ties, and has been one of the most vocal supporters of this US team, even working out with the likes of Donovan Mitchell and developing some chemistry with him. All that being said, Kuz is definitely the most questionable roster spot in my prediction I think.

12th man: P.J. Tucker

In years past, the last spot on the US roster has been reserved for an incredibly raw, but promising talent (Anthony Davis in 2012), or a role player who knows his role and is willing to take a backseat (Barnes in 2016, Plumlee in 2014). With this in mind, I think **P.J. Tucker** would be the perfect guy for the last spot. A veteran who will always be ready no matter the amount of minutes, can reliably hit a corner three, and play tough-nosed defense. He also provides some versatility, being able to play the wing and some smallball 5 in a pinch.

This is the link ^ up here, it has a few links in there but this is the full post as is.

Rewind about 2-and-a-half years. Carmelo Anthony checks in a few minutes into the first quarter, his tenth time playing in the All-Star Game (and just his second time off the bench). His employer, the New York Knicks, are struggling for a late-seed playoff push — they’re just 23–34 by All-Star weekend — but you can’t pin the blame on Anthony. At this point, he’s averaging 23.4 points, 6 rebounds, and 2.9 assists per game, carrying the offensive load for a team that struggled with injuries (and having a god-awful roster in the first place).

Today, we’re midway through August and the 35-year-old Anthony remains without a job. What happened since?

You can find much debate just about anywhere as to whether Carmelo belongs in the league today. For the past few offseasons, videos of him working out and making fadeaway jumpers over D-2 college sophomores have inspired hope that Anthony is still in All-Star form, but the results on the court have disagreed.

In the 17–18 season, Carmelo struggled season-long to find his role in Oklahoma City, playing alongside two ball-dominant stars in Russell Westbrook and Paul George. Used to an offense centered around him, he seemed to insist that OKC was similarly-structured, isolating just over 3 times per game and scoring at a 42.3% eFG%. While Melo would certainly have been better off-ball (51.6% eFG% in OKC spot-up situations), he had very Me7oish moments that would make any Thunder fan cringe in hindsight, taking over in moments that likely would have been better off had his All-Star teammates Russell Westbrook or Paul George closed them out.
After an uninspired first-round exit to the lower-seeded Utah Jazz and blessing us all with an amazingly-ironic quote, Melo found himself playing for the Houston Rockets on a league-minimum deal, coming off of the bench for a team desperately needing a spot-up scorer at the forward spot following the absences of Luc Mbah a Moute and Trevor Ariza.

He was cut in November.

Since then, we haven’t seen Carmelo on an NBA court, sans the one time he nearly shot a dead ball while sitting courtside at Dwyane Wade’s last game. So is Carmelo Anthony good enough to remain in the NBA? Or are the last moments of his otherwise-honorable career marred by underwhelming shot selection and an inability to adapt to the modern game?

In the short time Anthony spent with Houston, he found himself less useful than his teammates in the Rockets’ strict Moreyball offense. Where much of Anthony’s value earlier in his career stemmed from being able to attack off the dribble and create separation, Anthony’s game in Houston was marginalized to a strict diet of catch-and-shoot opportunities. This decision isn’t necessarily Houston’s fault — just refer to Anthony’s performances in OKC — but Anthony simply was not more effective as a catch-and-shoot scorer than much of the surrounding roster beside him.
In Houston’s catch-and-shoot opportunities, Carmelo scored at a 47.3 eFG%, or around the 40th percentile, according to NBA.com stats. This ranks below everyone on Houston’s roster but Gary Clark, Iman Shumpert, and Nene. To be an iffy shooter is one thing — to be a worse shooter than Kenneth Faried is another. Melo’s athleticism and fluidity on the court has been greatly diminished since his time in New York, as well: Melo’s average speed defensively ranked second-worst among all Rockets players, and his average speed offensively fit right at the bottom.

Melo’s greatest strengths lie among the least valuable skillsets in the modern era of the NBA, where ISO-heavy offenses and pull-up midrange shots have diminished considerably. Melo’s weaknesses — which include his defensive ineptitude and inability to fit (or want to fit) in a modern offense — have been exploited quickly by opposing teams over the past couple of years. I think we may have seen Carmelo’s last game in an NBA uniform — where he shot 1-for-11 in a loss to OKC.

For example. Tim Hardaway Jr. is a better basketball than Doug McDermott. Tim Hardaway will put up much better counting stats and will lead a team to more victories than McDermott could. However, a player like McDermott can be seen as more valuable because his skill set allows him to play better along top players. So who should be ranked higher?

For context, I started a series in r/nba where I wanted to go through different advanced metrics and break down how they're calculated and what they do well (or don't do well). Someone over there suggested I post here as well, so here it is.

For the first post in this series, I wanted to look at a stat that is more commonly used but still may seem a little confusing to someone that's new to basketball. And for those of us familiar with it, we probably still don't know exactly what ingredients go into pumping out the numbers we end up seeing. So with that, let's take a look at **Player Efficiency Rating, or PER**.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Basics

PER is a stat created by John Hollinger (formerly of ESPN, currently with the Memphis Grizzlies), that attempts to encapsulate the entirety of a player's performance per minute into one single number, relative to the rest of the league (league average PER is always 15), while adjusting for pace. It is a series of terms (some positive, some negative) that are added together, resulting in one number that represents that player's contribution to his team.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Formula

So with that, let's dive into the nitty gritty. I'll list out the formula (as found on basketball-reference.com), and below that I will define each of the variables and take a closer look at what it's doing.

&amp;#x200B;

uPER = ( 1 / MP ) \* \[ 3P + ( 2 / 3 ) \* AST + ( 2 - factor \* ( team\_AST / team\_FG ) ) \* FG + ( FT \* 0.5 \* ( 1 + ( 1 - ( team\_AST / team\_FG ) ) + ( 2 / 3 ) \* ( team\_AST / team\_FG ) ) ) - VOP \* TOV - VOP \* DRB% \* ( FGA - FG ) - VOP \* 0.44 \* ( 0.44 + ( 0.56 \* DRB% ) ) \* ( FTA - FT ) + VOP \* ( 1 - DRB% ) \* ( TRB - ORB ) + VOP \* DRB% \* ORB + VOP \* STL + VOP \* DRB% \* BLK - PF \* ( ( lg\_FT / lg\_PF ) - 0.44 \* ( lg\_FTA / lg\_PF ) \* VOP ) \]

&amp;#x200B;

WHEW! That, my friends, is a long equation. BUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE! First of all, some of you probably noticed that this formula hasn't accounted for pace anywhere. What's more, you might have noticed that absolutely nowhere in the formula is the number 15. ""But Rob, didn't you tell me this was a pace-adjusted formula and didn't you say that it's normalized to a league average of 15?"" Congrats! You'd be correct. What is listed above is actually ""unadjusted PER,"" meaning that we haven't accounted for pace yet, or normalized it. So to get there we need to take two more steps: first we adjust for pace, which we can call aPER:

&amp;#x200B;

aPER = uPER \* lg\_Pace / tm\_Pace

&amp;#x200B;

Then, we normalize it at 15 being the league average to get our final PER number, which is what you see when you look up the stat online:

&amp;#x200B;

PER = aPER \* (15 / lg\_aPER )

&amp;#x200B;

Congratulations on making it this far! Now, you might have realized that in the above paragraph, I said ""First of all..."" but had no following ""second of all..."" in the paragraph. Well here it is! Second of all, that formula has at least one variable that is completely unrecognizable. For example, what on earth is ""factor?"" Well a couple of these are small formulas on their own, while the others are standard NBA variables. So let me just list out and explain each piece.

* MP = Minutes played (remember, this is a per minute stat)
* 3P = 3-point field goals made
* AST = Assists
* FG = Field goals made
* FT = Free throws made
* FGA = Field goals attempted
* TBR = Total rebounds
* ORB = Offensive rebounds
* TOV = Turnovers
* factor = ( 2 / 3 ) - ( 0.5 \* ( lg\_AST / lg\_FG ) ) / (2 \* ( lg\_FG / lg\_FT ) )  

   * This is admittedly the strangest part of the whole equation... I will have a section below discussing this
* VOP = lg\_PTS / ( lg\_FGA - lg\_ORB + lg\_TOV + 0.44 \* lg\_FTA )  

   * This piece of the formula is essentially estimating the value of a possession, or the average points per possession across the league, with the numerator being league points and the denominator being an estimate of league possessions. The constant 0.44 is an estimate of the percentage of free throws that end a possession. However, it should be noted VOP is not a highly accurate estimate.
* DRB% = League average defensive rebounding percentage ( ( lg\_TRB - lg\_ORB ) / lg\_TRB )
* STL = Steals
* BLK = Blocks
* PF = Personal fouls

&amp;#x200B;

There we go! Now we have all the pieces to the puzzle. Now let's go through this monster of an equation and try and talk through what it's doing.

&amp;#x200B;

# Parsing the Equation

We've already explained the parts about adjusting for pace and normalizing to a league average of 15, so here we will focus on what's going into uPER. Let's take it term by term:

* 1/MP \* the rest of the formula
   * Dividing by minutes played to make it a per minute stat. Easy enough.
* 3P
   * 3P made is it's own part of the equation, weighted at 1.
* \+ ( 2 / 3 ) \* AST
   * Weighting an assist as 2/3. This fact combined with the weighting of 3P is a red flag for me. Yes there are additional factors below that don't make it that simple, but already I'm starting to question the reasoning behind how this is calculated.
* \+ ( 2 - factor \* ( team\_AST / team\_FG) ) \* FG
   * Alright, starting to get fun now! Let me first state that ""factor"" is an interesting piece all on it's own, so I'll give it its own paragraph below. But with that in mind, let's simplify it by not deep-diving into ""factor"" yet. So that leaves us with 2 \* FG as a piece of the equation, then you subtract out factor \* FG \* the percentage of team's FGs that are assisted. This seems to be weighting FGs as 2, but also subtracting some value based on how many of those FGs were assisted, which makes some sense (though it's not a perfect assumption by any means). When you consider 3P was weighted at 1, this is essentially giving us **total points scored outside of FT** ( 2 \* FG + 3P ) while making a slight tweak for if they were assisted.
* \+ ( FT \* 0.5 \* ( 1 + ( 1 - ( team\_AST / team\_FG ) ) + ( 2 / 3 ) \* ( team\_AST / team\_FG ) ) )
   * Here we're starting to factor FTs. But Hollinger is also again attempting to differentiate between assisted vs. unassisted. As above, t's pretty simplified by taking the team's unassisted FG rate ( 1 - ( team\_AST / team\_FG) ) and then a 2/3 weighting of the team's assisted FG rate. So here, the player's FT is weighted between 0.83 and 1 according to the team's assist rate (.83 if every FG is assisted; 1 if no FG is assisted).
* \- VOP \* TOV
   * This is our first negative term. Again, VOP is an estimate of the league average points per possession. So here we're subtracting out the average points per possession across the league that this player lost out on due to turnovers.
* \- VOP \* DRB% \* ( FGA - FG )
   * Here we have another negative term, but this time we're subtracting out the average points per possession (across the league) lost due to missed FG. Notice we're only accounting for missed points that we assume aren't rebounded by the offensive, by taking the league average DRB% and multiplying by missed FG and again by VOP.
* \- VOP \* 0.44 \* ( 0.44 + ( 0.56 \* DRB% ) ) \* ( FTA - FT )
   * This piece of the formula looks complicated, but I'll give you the simplified version first: we are calculating expected missed points due to missed FTs. Remember that 0.44 is a constant that is the rate at which a FT shot ends a possession (in other words, 44% of FTs are the last shot of a possession, generally speaking). So that middle term is looking for the rate at which a free throw not ending the possession does not result in an offensive rebound. So ultimately here we're taking VOP \* .44 \* (an estimate of the rate at with your team does not secure an offensive rebound on a FT) \* FT missed.
* \+ VOP \* ( 1 - DRB% ) \* ( TRB - ORB )
   * This looks to be an estimation of how many points the player ""contributed"" by rebounding, thus reducing the other team's opportunity to score. So we have VOP \* the league's average offensive rebound rate \* the number of the player's defensive rebounds.
* \+ VOP \* DRB% \* ORB
   * Here we have the VOP created by offensive rebounds, weighted by the DRB% of the league (so if they league as a whole doesn't defensive rebound as well, offensive rebounds aren't as valuable)
* \+ VOP \* STL
   * This is straightforward enough: VOP created by steals
* \+ VOP \* DRB% \* BLK
   * Again, fairly straightforward: we have VOP created by the number of blocks expected to be rebounded by his team
* \- PF \* ( ( lg\_FT / lg\_PF ) - 0.44 \* ( lg\_FTA / lg\_PF ) \* VOP )
   * Finally we get to our last term: fouls. We have the number of fouls committed by our player first, and again this is a negative term so we're taking out value that our player has cost the team by fouling. Then we have the rate at which PF results in made FTs in the league (lg\_FT / lg\_PF); so far we've subtracted out the number of FT we expected our player to have caused by fouling ( PF \* (lg\_FT / lg\_PF )). Then we're adding back in (the double negative) the VOP that comes of the free throw attempts that were expected to have ended that possession (which is why we have that .44 again). To be honest, I don't love the second part of what is factored in here for fouls, as I feel like it gives too much positive value. But that said, I think the first part of this term on its own would be too harsh for penalizing fouls.

And that covers all of the different terms going into PER! Some of it is pretty straightforward. Some of it has me scratching my head quite a bit. So with that said, let's take a closer look at ""factor."" And let me say up-front that I don't fully understand this part of the equation, but I'll do my best to reason out what purpose it serves. We won't get a clear answer, but I'll give my best guess.

Our first observation we can make is that Hollinger is not a believer in simplifying equations. It could much more easily be written as factor = ( 2 / 3 ) - ( ( 1 / 4 ) \* ( lg\_AST / lg\_FG ) \* ( lg\_FT / lg\_FG ) ). But let's take a look at the way Hollinger wrote it, as I suspect he did it for a reason. Without equation language, let's try and say what we're calculating here: two-thirds, minus ( ( half of the percentage of FG that are assisted ) divided by ( 2 times the ratio of FG to FT ) ). I think it's extremely important to note that ""factor"" is applied to the team's percentage of FGs that are assisted here. So it seems like he's trying to fine tune the relationship between assists, FGs, and FTs, and make sure they are weighted in a way that is fair to the value the player is created, but it really just gets a bit too convoluted to understand without asking Hollinger himself why he did some of the things he did. So we really do hit a bit of a roadblock here unfortunately.

&amp;#x200B;

# Strengths and Weaknesses

So now that we understand most of the ins and outs of PER, let's talk about how well we expect it to do its intended job.

**Strengths**

* Easily digestible and comparable across league
* Adjusts for the norms of a particular season by using lots of league average values for that seasons and normalizing to 15; ends up being an adjustment for different eras of the game
* Adjusts for pace and against league averages

**Weaknesses**

* Some of the constants (e.g. 0.44) are outdated and don't accurately reflect what they should
* Use of league averages don't always reflect true value; i.e. a possession lost due to TO by the 2015-16 Warriors should be more impactful than one by the 2011-12 Bobcats
* We're mainly looking at offensive performance; the two defensive stats incorporated (STL and BLK) don't necessarily translate to overall defensive impact, so that is a HUGE missing piece
* It doesn't account for who the player is playing with or against
* PER tends to favor volume regardless of efficiency
* Doesn't capture any non-box score stat that impacts the game

&amp;#x200B;

# Historical Examples

Now let's take a look at some historical seasons and the corresponding PER to see if we can find some examples of how it translates. I went to [basketball-reference.com](https://basketball-reference.com/) to find all PERs of players that played at least 60 games in a season in the 3-point era. Here are some of the findings:

* Historical top 100 PER seasons  

   * The top 100 looks pretty good! Better than I expected
   * The top 5 consists of 2 LeBron seasons, 2 MJ seasons, and Steph's best season.
   * Rounding out the top 10, we have some more MJ and LeBron, as well as Giannis last season (not crazy) and an Anthony Davis season (this is my first issue... AD is great, but at no point can we say he had one of the best 10 seasons of all time).
   * Kobe doesn't show up until 46, and he only has 2 seasons in the top 100.
   * I would have expected to see Harden higher, when you can make the case for arguably the best offensive season in history for both last season and the year before, but those seasons show up at 13 and 21.
   * If you change the criteria to a minimum of 54 games played, Boban shows up at 58!!!
* Role players on great teams (I believe this is an area where PER falls very short in adequately translating player value, especially defensive specialists)  

   * 2015-16 Warriors  

      * Draymond - 19.3
      * Andre Iguodala - 12.2 (12th on the team!)
      * Harrison Barnes - 12.3
   * 1995-96 Bulls  

      * Dennis Rodman - 13.6
      * Luc Longley - 11.9
      * Ron Harper - 14.4
      * Steve Kerr - 15.2
   * 1985-86 Celtics  

      * Robert Parish - 18.7
      * Bill Walton - 17.0
      * Danny Ainge - 13.6
   * 1999-00 Lakers  

      * Robert Horry -. 14.3
      * Ron Harper - 12.0
   * 2012-13 Heat  

      * Mario Chalmers - 13.3
      * Shane Battier - 10.7

# Conclusion

There we have it! Hopefully this either refreshed you or gave you a new understanding of what PER is, how it works, where it falls short, and provides some context for you next time you compare players with PER. It was one of the first advanced analytics out there, so while it isn't perfect by any means, I have to respect it as being a step in the right direction of trying to evaluate player past what's in the box score. I think there are many better ways of measuring that today, but PER still has a place in history.

Please let me know if you have any thoughts or feedback on this that I can incorporate into the next post in the series.

We're nearing the end of the series with the first team that isn't comprised of lotto players, this is the best of the rest of the first round. So any pick that was considered in the first round (so today picks 15-30) will make up this team. If a player was selected with, say the 27th pick but that was in the 2nd round during that draft then he *will not* be on this team. Everything stays exactly the same.

Ultimately I decided to just do the non-lotto first for a couple of reasons. First is most teams are really bad, we saw how bad some of the later lotto teams are, things don't get that much better. Combining everything into 1 team helps to even the playing field. Also this makes a bracket really easy, 16 total teams instead of all 30.

Quick refresher on the criteria I'm using

* **Only Players Who Were Selected In the Lotto Era are Eligible**

* **So only players selected from 1985 on are eligible for this exercise. (See previous posts for more explanation as to why)**
  * Only 16 teams will be created, 1 team for each lotto pick and 2 additional teams representing picks 15-30 and the second round

* **Positions and Peak is Taken into Account**

  * Each player is assumed to be at their absolute peak of their powers
Here is a link to a Google Doc that will house all the stats/accolades for each team that has been posted (so far picks #1-#14), and here are the list of the prior posts.

****
No surprise that this is a really, really good team seeing as it's the compilation of the best players across 16 picks. This roster was really hard to put together, I went back and forth so much over who to add to the team. This starting lineup is really, really good on both offense and defense. Dumars, Kawhi, Giannis, and Gobert have all made the All-Defense team multiple times, which on it's own is great, but this ability to help protect Nash on defense lets him focus all of his energy on offense. In addition to the stifling defense that this team has we have guys in Nash, Dumars, and Kawhi who can all make 3s giving the necessary spacing for Giannis to go hard to the rim. 

Just imagine a Nash/Giannis PnR or a Nash Gobert PnR, how on earth would you be able to stop that? Or even imagine Nash and Giannis on a fast break with Kawhi and Dumars trailing for 3 and Gobert cutting to the rim. This starting 5 can defend any team and score on anyone. A defense with Kawhi and Giannis is terrifying, imagine LeBron's frustration with a team being able to throw both Kawhi and Giannis at him. It took a while to construct this starting 5, but I really love this unit. They're going to be elite on both offense and defense. 

A few thoughts with constructing the rest of the roster: 


****
* The list of players who didn't make the cut is pretty long so I'll keep it to my hardest omissions:

 * Terry Porter
 * Mark Jackson
 * David West
 * Zach Randolph
 * Jermaine O'Neal
 * Danny Granger
 * Arvydas Sabonis
 * Latrell Sprewell
 * Metta World Peace
 * Gerald Wallce
 * Rajon Rondo
 * Michael Finley
 * AC Green
 * Hedo Turkoglu
 * Josh Smith
 * Tayshaun Prince

This is only a small sample of guys who would be on most of the other teams in this tournament. And honestly a team made up of the guys on this list would also be a really good team. Terry Porter, Jermaine O'Neal and Sabonis were my hardest cuts (maybe I'm a secret Blazers fan....) I went back and forth between Lowry and Porter on who would make the team. Both put up similar stats, Porter was a slightly better shooter and distributor, I think Lowry is a bit better on defense. I went with Lowry, which could be some recency bias, but honestly it's splitting hairs between the two players. I think Lowry can is a bit better so Porter makes the honorable mention.  Rondo, Jackson, even Cassell were tough cuts, but Lowry stood above them all in my mind. Tony Parker was a no brainer for the bench spot, he's a future HOFer and in his prime he was one of the hardest guys in the NBA to guard.  

* Creating the bigs for this team was really hard, there's talented bigs to choose from. I knew I wanted Gobert, he's the best rim protector of the bunch, and Kemp who was the prototype for STAT and would make an ideal PnR partner for Nash and TP. The last big was impossible to choose from. I was between Sabonnis, O'Neal, West, Randolph, and Divac. West and Randolph, while really really good, fell just short of making the cut. Both were great 4s who were tough guards, but they would struggle guarding against other centers so leaving them off made sense. Guys like Giannis or Kirilenko can pick up the 4s. Divac vs O'Neal vs Sabonnis was impossible to choose from. If I could get Soviet Sabonnis it's an easy decision, he's the starter on the team and would probably lead this team to the championship round at least. But we got an older Sabonnis, who was still really, really good, but his knees were gone. O'Neal was a much better scorer than Vlade and had a 3-4 year stretch of being one of the NBA's elite bigs. He was probably the better rim protector, but Vlade was a smarter defender who had excellent instincts on defense. Vlade's passing was the reason why he made the cut (which was excruciating). Vlade's passing from the elbows as an extra facilitator would be devastating, adding another dimension on offense. Having Nash and Vlade with athletes like Kawhi, Giannis, Kemp, Butler etc. really puts intense pressure on opposing defenses. 

* Wings were a bit easier to choose from. Jimmy Butler has an argument to start of Joe Dumars, but Dumars was a more consistent shooter than Butler and their defense is a wash with a slight edge maybe to Dumars. Danny Granger was a tough omission, he's a very underrated player who's been lost in the shuffle of the mid 2000s. I picked AK47 because a potential defense of him, Giannis, and Kawhi is mindblowing. How would opposing defenses penetrate? And then if you have Gobert in the lineup as well, how would teams score at the rim? Martin is the best shooter who was left over and is just a great fit in any lineup. He can go off screens and space the floor, doesn't need the ball to be effective and isn't a terrible defender. 



****

This team might be the best team in the field. They're really deep with guards, wings, and bigs. Giannis and Kawhi are a deadly combo that I didn't spend nearly as much time on as I should have. They are devastating two-way players who can carry the load on offense and shut down the other team's best player. I'm curious about what people think of this team, and who I left off. But this team will be able to defend and will be able to shoot 3s, which makes them one of our contenders.

# Observations:

* For better or for worse, PIPM appears to concur with the voters more often than not, and where it doesn't, the difference usually isn't much, like Paul Pierce losing to Ray Allen by 0.1 Wins.
* The strangest result is 2005, where apparently the best three players (Billups and both Wallaces) were all on the losing side, and the FMVP wasn't even the highest on his own team - although Manu over Duncan that year is canon amongst many Spurs fans I've spoken to.
* Duncan loses another to David Robinson, an advanced stats God, but regains 2007.
* Wade over Chandler over Dirk in 2011 is another curious case.
* I expect blowback over 2010 and 2015 but they're fairly consistent with the other advanced stats.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,62860,public,self,Finals (non luck adjusted) PIPM [1997-2019],0,1565185978,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cmquzi/finals_non_luck_adjusted_pipm_19972019/,,,,,,,,,,

-Think outside the box and form a team that is greater than the sum of its parts. It's absolutely fine to make a lineup of only superstars, but be more creative than saying Curry/MJ/LeBron/KD/Shaq or Magic/MJ/Bird/Duncan/Wilt or something like that. We all know they're all-time great players and they'd mesh well, but I would prefer people to focus more on play style and chemistry than just throwing the most talented players all on one team.

-**Have at least two players that are not consensus top 25ish player of all time.** Obviously this is subjective, so I'll just leave this up to your own judgement. I'm not saying it has to be a role player per se, but just be a little creative.

-You get to choose 5 starters. You can throw in 3 to 5 bench players to if you're feeling up to it.

-**Provide reasoning** for your answers. It doesn't have too be as in depth or state the specific year for each player like mine, but at least provide some rationale.



**Example Team:**

* PG - Jason Kidd (2002-2003)

* SG - Kawhi Leonard (2015-2016)

* SF - Shawn Marion (2002-2003)

* PF - Kevin Garnett (2003-2004)

* C - Ben Wallace (2003-2004)

* Backup PG - Mookie Blaylock (1996-1997)

* Backup SG - Dwyane Wade (2008-2009)

* Backup  SF - Bruce Bowen (2002-2003)

* Backup PF - Pascal Siakam (2018-2019)

* Backup C - Robert Parish (1981-1982)

I genuinely believe any certain combination of these guys could fit any play style and matchup against any all-time talented team well. If you want to have a monster transition lineup, you can go Kidd / Wade / Marion / Siakam / Garnett. If you want defense, just look at the starting lineup. Now one thing I wanted to make sure with my team is that we would not get beat on the board. All my players in the starting lineup are over-achievers at rebounding at their position. Robert Parish is the perfect center off the bench, as he is extremely adaptable and reliable at the center spot with a sweet midrange J, a monster for getting offensive rebounds, and is quick enough on his feet to be able to be respectable on the perimeter in short spurts, but still strong enough to matchup against true centers. Dwyane Wade is my 6th man and is obviously better than Kawhi Leonard in 2016, but he's there because he is my ideal 6th man. He brings activity to a team that might be stagnant or need change, as his relentless movement in off-ball cuts and high energy production is enough to lift any team when they need it. Kawhi is in the starting lineup because of his efficiency at all 3 levels (drives, mid, and 3) and his unparalleled 1-on-1 defense. In the stretches when Kawhi didn't have to carry the whole offensive load during this season, he played with very little mistakes, which is almost impossible to do on the basketball court, but he did it. In a certain way, it's blasphemous to say this due to how talented he was, but I see Kawhi's 2016 form as something of a super-duper role player. His offensive play could fit into any system, provide solid isos when necessary, and provide reliable spacing without demanding too many touches. He's there to cover the other team's best opposing perimeter player man-to-man, too. Our team is stout enough defensively that switching onto someone else in the perimeter (with the exception of maybe Big Ben) is pretty foolish. Jason Kidd runs our offense, of course. Every player on this team is smart as hell, so if Jason Kidd passes the ball, each plays knows they've got a good shot setup for them. Shawn Marion in 2003 was a very capable 3 point shooter while still keeping his all around play, greatness in transition, and general excellence on defense. He could switch onto players big or small no problem, but still be great as a help defender. Kevin Garnett kind of explains himself, absolute monster. Ben Wallace is a top 5 team defender of all-time imo, and his presence there with Garnett makes this team damn near impossible to score on with ease. Every posession is a grindfest with this team. My team will wear any team it matches up against, regardless of the other team's talent.



Just for the hell of it, here's another example team (which I won't give my rationale for choosing, because I already did for my other team):

* PG - Stephen Curry (2015-2016)

* SG - Klay Thompson (2015-2016)

* SF - Scottie Pippen (1994-1995)

* PF - Draymond Green (2015-2016)

* C - Tim Duncan (2002-2003)

* Backup PG - Alvin Robertson (1985-1986)

* Backup SG - Shane Battier (2006-2007)

* Backup SF - Alex English (1982-1983)

* Backup PF - Dennis Rodman (1991-1992)

* Backup C - Bill Russell (1964-1965)

Mine won't be as in depth as his but I'm going to do my best to not be lazy about it.

**Point guard: Derrick Rose 2010-2011**

Derrick Rose's MVP season was magical. This was the year where he led us to a league-best 62 wins behind his 25-4-7 stat line. Bulls fans were fairly confident that this would be the beginning of a rebirth of Chicago basketball. We all know what happened but none of us will forget how freakishly athletic and explosive prime D Rose was. 

**Shooting Guard: Michael Jordan 1987-1988**

This one was tough because I had to pick Michael Jordan's best year and I know that there will be some people that will be upset that I picked a year that was not one of the six where he won the championship but let me defend myself here and try to explain how ridiculous his 1988 season was. Not only did he have an absurd stat line of 35-6-6 but here is the list of accolades he picked up from that year:

* MVP

* All-Star Game MVP

* Steals Leader

* Scoring Leader

* Slam Dunk Contest Champion

* Defensive Player of the Year

* 1st team All-NBA

* 1st team All-Defense

I feel fairly confident in saying this is one of the greatest seasons of all time even if it didn't lead to a championship. He didn't have Scottie but that shouldn't be a knock on Michael individually.

**Small Forward: Scottie Pippen 1994-1995**

Again, I'm going by individual performance here so I know I'll get flack for not picking a championship year. Scottie was one of the most lock-down defensive players of all time. 22-8-6 while also leading the league and steals and earning All-NBA first team honors. 

**Power Forward Dennis Rodman 1995-1996**

Not the best season of his career but still All-NBA defensive first team and league rebound leader with a kooky 5-15-2 stat line. His elite rebounding and defense make it way easier for the rest of this team to find lanes and get opportunities to score. 

**Center: Artis Gilmore 1977-1978**

Artis was probably the greatest Bull of all time before some guy named Michael Jordan was drafted and for good reason. This season he put up a whopping 23-13 stat line while earning all-defensive and all-star nods. Bulls fans don't show the A-Train enough love. 

**6th Man: Jerry Sloan 1968-1969**

Yes, THAT Jerry Sloan. Before he was a coach he was 1st team all-defense and an all star this season with a respectable 17-8-4 stat line that would really give this team a huge spark off the bench. 

**Back up PG: Norm Van Lier 1973-1974**

Norm was one of the first prototypical defensive point guards of the era. This season he earned himself first team defense and all-NBA honors as a point guard. An underappreciated piece of Bulls history that would definitely gel well with this squad and is very deserving of a roster spot.

**Back up Wing: Jimmy Butler 2016-2017**

Jimmy was the face of the franchise after the loss of Derrick Rose and it was in this season that he posted career highs in points, rebounds, and assist with a 24-6-6 stat line while also being one of the best wing defenders in the NBA. 

**Back up Forward: Bob Love 1970-1971**

Bob Love was a great man on and off the court. Sure he averaged 25-9 this season but he was also one of the greatest humanitarians the franchise has ever seen which played a big role in having his jersey retired by the Bulls. His scoring ability as a forward in this era would be a great balance with his defensive counterparts. 

Back up Center: Joakim Noah 2013-2014 

Hard to believe it was only 5 years ago that Jo was the NBA defensive player of the year. No brainer for this pick

3rd Forward: Luol Deng 2011-2012

The Sudanese Assassin was such a big part of this team that once again had the best regular season record in the NBA. All-star and all-defensive selections this year for Luol as he was a force on every play. His grit and toughness will help give this squad the edge it needs to win those close games.  

**12th Man: BJ Armstrong 1994-1995**

BJ Armstrong back in the day was a real knock-down three point shooter in an era where the 3 wasn't nearly the same mechanism that it is today. He led the league in 3p% the year prior and followed it up with an all-star performance and another spectacular showing from 3, paving the way for the rest of the team to get some much needed spacing. 

**IR: Toni Kukoc, Reggie Theus, Chet Walker** 

**Coach: Phil Jackson**

They were going to be divided in three teams, that consisted of 2 backcourt and 3 frontcourt athletes each. Here are the results:

&amp;#x200B;

* All-Decade 1st team: Stephen Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard.
* All-Decade 2nd team: Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony, Anthony Davis and Blake Griffin.
* All-Decade 3rd team: Dwyane Wade, Kobe Bryant, Paul George, LaMarcus Aldridge and Giannis Antetokounmpo.

Notable players not mentioned (that I remember): Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Dwight Howard, Chris Bosh and Kevin Love.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the main problem with this list are the fowards selected outside of the 1st team. I get KD, LBJ and Kawhi on the 1st team. All won championships, Finals MVP, notable regular season awards (MVP, DPOY) and have great playoff sucess. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, what's the point for Melo and AD over Dirk and Duncan? The first two have almost no good playoff moments. Melo had great numbers and memorable performances, but they were all in the regular season, when games aren't as important. He also only made the playoffs three times in the past ten years, and in only one of them he got past the 1st round. Davis' greatest acomplishment was sweeping the Blazers in 2018 only to lose in 5 on the WCSF.

&amp;#x200B;

Dirk and Duncan, however, have won championships, made it to the playoffs multiple times, have been great until like 2015-2016, and helped a lot their teams win games. Duncan was still an awesome player by the time the Spurs won the Heat in 2014. Dirk had one of the greatest playoff runs of all-time in 2011. Does someone have one single reason to put Aldridge, Blake, PG, Giannis, AD or Melo over those two?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, what is the argument for Giannis or Aldridge over Bosh? LaMarcus made the playoffs a lot of times in the past 10 years. But, he never got too far in the playoffs and also don't have crazy good numbers. Giannis has only been a top-tier player like Lebron for the past two seasons, and his last year was the only one he had a top-4 record. Bosh was one of the greatest players of this era. He was a key part of the big-3, undoubtedly and All-Star until his last season with the Heat. We've seen also two really good years of his without LBJ on the squad and he was still really good. I feel like Bosh's awesome 7 seasons with the Heat are more than either Giannis or Aldridge have done.

&amp;#x200B;

This is how I would've organized this list:

&amp;#x200B;

* All-Decade 1st team: same as the [NBA.com](https://NBA.com) one.
* All-Decade 2nd team: Dwyane Wade, Russell Wesbrook, Dirk Nowitzki, Tim Duncan and Chris Bosh.
* All-Decade 3rd team: Chris Paul, Kobe Bryant, Paul George, Blake Griffin and Anthony Davis.

I also decided that Wade was more greater than Russ. I know Westbrook's 2017 season was historic and all, but Wade was a really good player until he left the Heat for the Bulls in 2016. 2 rings, was a superstar until 2011, and has done more in the postseason than the Brodie. The last spot of the fowards on the 3rd team was given to AD, but you can put either Melo or Aldridge over him and I'll understand.

There is a common trend to imply that this team is going to have some kind of 2006-level crisis at the upcoming World Championship because so many stars have dropped out. 

I can't help but think this won't be an issue just given the overall level of talent that will still exist for this team vs the rosters of other competing countries. Obviously the 2006 team didn't have to deal with anyone like Giannis, Serbia is going to be better than any team Team USA would have played back then, and the overall quality of their opponents in this tournament, but the pieces on this team will likely fit together a lot better than the 2006 team, even with the lack of star power.

Assuming the key pieces on this team will be Donovan Mitchell (a scorer who has two years of playoff experience being the go-to option for the West 5th seed), Kemba Walker (All-NBA and Allstar who has been carrying a team by himself since he joined the league), Khris Middleton (NBA Allstar and experienced playoff vet as a second option), Tatum, Brown, and Smart, who all have multiple seasons a high-caliber role players together. Then to top it off, there is still the chance to add veteran pieces in Kyle Lowry, Brook Lopez, and Harrison Barnes along with promising young players like De'Aaron Fox, Kyle Kuzma, and Bam Adebayo.

Obviously, compared to how loaded the original Team USA roster looked, this group of players looks weak, but I still can't overlook the fact that this team would be very competitive in the NBA if all of these players ended up together. Using the same logic, I can't say the same for some of the international teams.

Greece is essentially Giannis and this brothers playing with a handful of NBA washouts or players who never made the league. Giannis is definitely the best player in the tournament, but I'm not seeing how Giannis and this supporting cast would be able to compete against a well rounded NBA roster. 

Spain is a lot weaker than in years previous as well. Rubio is nowhere near the level of guard that he will be asked to compete against, and Sergio Llull will be his running mate. The Hernangomez brothers will be their main contributors, both of whom are rotational players in the NBA, and then there is an aging Marc Gasol, who likely will have a similar impact as he had with the Raptors. That is obviously an important player to have, but he wont be helping behind anything close to the likes of Lowry, Leonard, and Siakum.  

France and Australia could fill starting lineups of just NBA players, but most of them would be regular role players in the league, and their European players aren't at the level of Spain or Serbia's.

Serbia is definitely going to be something to worry about. No beating around that bush. Jokic is the second best player after Giannis and he has much better pieces around him, but the area where USA lacks the most is with bigs.

Overall though, I still can't help but feel this Team USA is a heavy favorite and is actually going to be built in a way that has players with defined roles that match their roles in the NBA on high-level teams. I just can't look past that fact and feel concern about the lack of star power, when arguably playing 5 stars together with 5 more coming off the bench could create great vulnerability. Those undefined roles seemed to be half of what happened in 2006, combined with relying on players like Iverson, Marbury, and Boozer instead of the younger LBJ and Wade. 

So while the ceiling on this team will be a lot lower than the ""Dream Team"" it could be, it still feels like the team is deep enough and experienced enough to roll through this tournament without any real hiccups.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,62766,public,self,Should Team USA be worried because of the player withdrawals?,0,1565132432,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cmifn1/should_team_usa_be_worried_because_of_the_player/,,,,,,,,,,

 Here’s a blurb from Wikipedia about Groza:

&gt;Groza was drafted in the 1st round of the 1949 NBA Draft by the Indianapolis Olympians. Groza averaged 23.4 points per game in his rookie season and was named NBA Rookie of the Year. Because the award was selected by newspaper writers at the time, the NBA currently does not recognize Groza having won the award. He averaged 22.5 points per game over two seasons before being implicated along with college teammates Ralph Beard and Dale Barnstable in a point shaving scandal during the 1948–49 season at Kentucky. NBA president Maurice Podoloff banned all of the implicated players from the league for life.

&gt;As a result of this ban, Groza became the first player in NBA history to end his career with a season in which he averaged at least 20 points per game (Groza averaged 21.7 PPG during the 1950–51). In NBA history, only three players have had higher scoring averages in their final NBA seasons: Bob Pettit (22.5 PPG in '64-65), Paul Arizin (21.9 PPG in '61-62), and Dražen Petrović (22.3 PPG in '92-93).

Groza won back to back NCAA titles with Kentucky in 1948 &amp; 1949, along with winning a US gold medal at the Olympics.

His rookie year stats were [really impressive as a rookie](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/grozaal01.html)

To add to the story, his teammates from that Kentucky team basically founded the olympians (they were all allowed to be on the same team) and were fairly successful, making the postseason both seasons he was there. Everyone on the team was a rookie except Bruce Hale, who had one year of experience 6 members of the team also played for that Kentucky team). 

The point shaving scandal involved Groza, Ralph Beard and Dale Barnstable. They were given $2,000 to win a game by less than 10 points. Without Groza and Beard (who were both 2x all NBA players and the leading scorers for the Olympians), the team would fold after the 1953 season, leaving Indiana without a team for 15 years.

Do you think he would’ve made the Hall of Fame if there was no scandal up to that point? 2x All-NBA, 2x NCAA championships as the captain and an Olympic Gold medal probably would’ve done it in the late 40s",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,62751,public,self,Anyone know about Alex “The Beak” Groza?,0,1565115061,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cmelnt/anyone_know_about_alex_the_beak_groza/,,,,,,,,,,

I love the quality, in-depth basketball analysis in this subreddit! Inspired by u/mdicke3's All Time draft position teams, I have decided to start my own hypothetical project: All Time NBA teams.

The rules are simple: you can use any season that the player played for the team, but you can only use each player once. So, no army of LeBrons patrolling the perimeter for Miami (although that would make for another fun hypothetical discussion too!) They don't have to have played the whole season, and yes, I chose that rule so I could ensure Marc Gasol quarterbacks the defence. Only took a couple months for him to be an all timer in my eyes! But, anyhow, in all seriousness, if the player played for two teams the season that you select them, you take the statistics accrued in the part of the season they played with the team. Multiple teams can take the same player, this is a hypothetical best team your team could yield.

Anyways, I don't have the time or knowledge to do every other team but I would love to read them, so if someone else wants to do one of their favourite teams later this week, that would be pretty cool! In the meantime, without further ado, I give you my all time Toronto Raptors.

**Point Guard: Kyle Lowry 2015-2016**

As easy a decision as this is to pick Lowry, deciding on the year was monumentally tough. Which version do you pick? 2015-2016 was third team All-NBA and easily the best defensively, with 2.1 steals and 3.7 defensive win shares a game. It was also his most impressive by a number of advanced calculations like BPM and VORP. However, during 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 Lowry reached another level shooting the ball, posting career high eFg%s of .569 and .553 respectively. And of course, while the most recent incarnation saw a dramatic drop off in usage and is a step slower, 2018-2019 is undoubtedly the wisest and most confident the Bay Street Bulldog has ever looked.

All that said though, I chose the 2015-2016 version. As the say, at the end of the day, defence wins championships, and this version of Lowry has another gear locking in individually that isn't there anymore. Also, while his shooting numbers wouldn't have matched the next two seasons either way, it's worth noting that his playoff percentages would have been way higher if he was healthier! Elbow bursitis is no joke. While I would have loved to get the clutch version I saw down the stretch this year, I'm confident that if this Kyle was getting those looks in Game 6 he would have buried them too. Last but certainly not least, let's not forget this is the only version of Kyle to have ever beaten Lebron in the playoffs (even if it just was a couple games).

**Shooting Guard: Vince Carter 2000-2001**

This one wasn't so tough. Vince Carter averaged 27.6 points per game on an 51 percent effective field goal percentage, including a scintillating 41% from deep. He also averaged 4 assists, 5.5 boards, 1.5 steals and a block a game. With Kawhi taking the bigger, stronger wing threat, Carter can chase around a shooter and focus on scoring.

**Small Forward: Kawhi Leonard 2018-2019**

The most obvious pick, Kawhi would obviously be the lynchpin of this team. With Lowry, Carter, (spoilers!) Bosh, and Gasol spacing the floor, defenses will be hard pressed to find a solution for Kawhi. Between his brute strength and shooting mastery from all over the court, very few teams will have a player equipped to handle No. 2 one on one. Defensively, he's a game changer; able to match up against the Lebrons, MJs and Larry Birds of the tournament.

**Power Forward: Chris Bosh 2006-2007**

Despite Bosh's obvious excellence, this was a bit of a tough pick. I considered shifting him to Center and slotting Pascal in here to create a quicker team with a little more three point range. Although Bosh developed into an excellent 3 point shooting centre with the Heat, during his tenure with the Raptors he he never really shot many threes. Furthermore, beyond spacing not being ideal, his favourite place to go to work is the high left post...which also happens to be Marc Gasol's favourite spot to direct traffic and make plays. While he was a relatively willing passer during his years here, the ball never really hummed when he had it, and him and Kawhi could potentially turn into a laborious ""your turn, my turn"" dynamic that wouldn't get the most out of their talents. Despite all that, I still think Bosh is the clear cut starting Power Forward. Having him at Center just won't work in this tournament; there are too many hulking centers that would score in the paint and probably run him into foul trouble. So that's out. However, while he is a little small for the 5 against some of these guys, his defence at the 4 with someone marginally competent beside him would be downright scary. And while he wouldn't necessarily space the floor out to the three point line, Gasol can, and Bosh was absolute money from midrange.

I ended up going with the 2006-2007 version because that season seemed to be more impressive than his later campaigns from defense and rebounding perspective. Both DWS and DBPM peg it as his most successful defensive campaign after his rookie season (which is an interesting tidbit in and of its own right but probably a topic for another day). It was undoubtedly his most successful Raptors season from a team perspective, despite primarily sharing the court with such luminaries as TJ Ford, Anthony Parker, Jorge Garbajosa, and Rasho Nesterovic. I have nothing but love for these guys, especially TJ and Garbo with their tragic injuries, but they aren't who you expect to see manning a 47 win team. He had slightly better offensive campaigns the next couple years, but all take the guy who got a second team All NBA nod over KG.

**Center: Marc Gasol 2018-2019**

Marc Gasol's numbers are underwhelming-9 points, 6.5 boards, 4 assists during the tailend of the regular season he spent in Toronto, followed up by an, on paper, even less impressive 9.4, 6.4 and 3. On paper, that is. Anyone who watched the games this offseason saw just how valuable his defense was. Advanced stats back this up. His DBPM of 4.3 in the playoffs matched his previous playoff career high that he set during his 2012-2013 Defensive Player of the Year campaign and almost matched his 2012-2013 regular season of 4.4 His Defensive Win Shares blow every other season he has had out of the water. And offensively, forget everything he does for spacing, there isn't another big man on the potential roster even close to his passing ability. He's a no brainer for this spot, even if guys like AD or JV have gaudier rebounds and points. Gasol gives you a chance against the Shaqs, Kareems, and Wilts who will be starring for other teams with storied pasts.

**6th Man: DeMar DeRozan 2017-2018**

I have always thought that DeMar's best chance to have a successful career is to embrace a Manu role on a team (interestingly, I have thought this since long before the trade). His inability to either lock in defensively or stretch the floor make him somewhat of a liability whenever he doesn't touch the ball. But he is excellent with it. Like, very excellent. This version of DeMar was so excellent with the ball that despite those flaws, he finished 8th in MVP voting and earned second team All-NBA honours. 2017-2018 DeMar DeRozan took a leap as a playmaker that would make him perfectly suited to come in off the bench and attack defenses. Despite being a phenomenal athlete in his own right, he is clearly in a league behind Vince and Kawhi- no shame in that, they are two of the craziest freak athletes in the world! However, most teams will have starters with that extra notch of athleticism and coming off the bench would allow DeMar to go to work against guys he can beat.

**Back-Up PG: Fred Van Vleet Sr. 2018-2019**

I might catch some heat for this one, and maybe I am falling victim to recency bias. There are other contenders for this spot, for sure. Jose Calderon's 2007-2008 season was only 16 free throws shy of joining the 50-40-90 club and dwarfs FVV's regular season by any offensive statistical measure. Even in the playoffs, his numbers don't look very impressive because he started slow. But after his wife gave birth to his son, Fred Van Vleet Jr., FVV put up a blistering 9 game stretch where he scored 15 PPG on 51% from the field and 52% from 3 while clinching an NBA championship. While it's unrealistic to expect FVV to sustain that level of production, his tenacious defense and Curry-esque range give him the edge here. I worry that he won't be able to be as effective a defender against many of the guards he will face in this tournament as he was against Steph, but it's not like Calderon would fair much better against a Gary Payton or a Jason Kidd anyhow. And I think we can all agree that as masterful a job as Calderon would do with the second unit, he would be a liability against the small quick scorers that FVV excels against.

**Back-Up Wing: Danny Green 2018-2019**

This was a tough one. Doug Christie put up a great season in 1996-1997, playing his usual excellent defence and adding 4.7 threes on 38% accuracy. T-Mac averaged 2 blocks a game along with 15, 6 and 3. Anthony Parker had a solid three year stretch but had no season as impressive on either end as Green did this year. And sure, he wasn't as consistent as Danny either, but Mo Pete made the coolest shots ever. In the end, nobody had a season that combined shooting and defense like Danny Green did this year. He shot a scorching .632 TS% and played excellent defense all year, often taking the toughest assignment with Kawhi resting frequently. Despite his poor playoff showing shooting the rock, he earned this spot.

**Back-Up Forward: Pascal Siakam 2018-2019**

This is an easy pick. Siakam's 17 PPG on an elite .591 eFG% along with excellent defense earned him Most Improved Players hardware this season, and it also notched him solidly ahead of guys like Antonio Davis, Amir Johnson, and Serge for the backup forward role. He can sub in for either one of forwards and immediately provide a change of pace to Bosh and Leonard's more methodical styles. Pascal's run outs are always impactful, but as we saw the season before, him getting out in transition against benches is extra deadly. Defensively, he fits in with the long, switch happy scheme that worked in the playoffs.

**Back-Up Centre: Marcus Camby 1997-1998**

Marcus Camby may not have developed into future defensive player of the year yet, but he lead the league with 3.7 blocks that year! Truth be told, I didn't realize just how good Camby  was when we traded him for Oakley, and now that I'm looking at his numbers I'm beginning to get a little upset. He posted 12 points, 7.5 boards, a steal and 2 assists a game in addition to shot blocking. I was tempted to put Serge in here for spacing and chutzpah, but young Camby is just in another league protecting the rim.

**3rd PG: Damon Stoudamire 1996-1997**

I can't imagine sulking Stoudamire would be thrilled backing up a player as unaccomplished as FVV but it is what it is. For all their physical similarities, present day FVV grades out way higher in DBPM, finishing -0.7 in the regular season and 0.4 in the playoffs. Raptors era Stoudamire never finished higher than -2.1. Now, some of this is the players around you, and without a doubt, FVV has had the luxury of playing with all world defenders. But, I just don't think I could plug a guy who is that much of a liability defensively into the backup role in this tournament. Even DeMar has never dropped below -1.9 on the season. However, I can totally take a 20 and 9 guy as my third string guy. If the matchups played out, Damon would be a huge boon off the bench, bringing instant offense and creativity. However, I worry that with FVV on the team, he already might end up redundant, with more of his time going to...

**12th Man: Tracy McGrady 1999-2000**

Obviously there's a couple versions of T-Mac out there not buried on the bench. But 20 year old Raptors McGrady isn't one of them. He had a good year, but not super noteworthy. As mentioned earlier, he averaged 15-6-3-2, which is a nice well rounded contribution. But more importantly, he is an elite athlete. In case of injury trouble, I would rather have a young McGrady filling in for Kawhi trying to guard all timers than some of the less athletically gifted guys guarding LBJ. He also has some ball handling skills and could fill in as a back up PG against bigger guards. As much as I considered my own personal childhood hero Alvin Williams for the spot, he just wasn't the same caliber of athlete as McGrady

**IR: Jose Calderon 2007-2008, Jonas Valanciunas 2018-2019, Donyell Marshall 2003-2004**

With all due respect to TJ Ford, who was a great playmaker and had a real shot to be a special player before Al Horford accidentally derailed his career, the IR PG spot is Jose's to lose. In addition to being a stellar shooter, he is a great leader who would have absolutely no problem not making the rotation. JV provides another big body if Marc or Marcus go down and some great offence if needed. Although he saw a down tick in minutes, his per36 stats were great before getting traded this year (and obviously continued to be down the stretch for Memphis too). Last but certainly not least, Marshall averaged 16 and 10 on 40% 3 point shooting. I really am strongly considering putting him in the rotation, but I just don't know who to take out. He's not quite as valuable and versatile as Green or McGrady defensively, even if he was a better scorer than both (while Raptors). For now, he stays on the IR.

**Coach: Nick Nurse 2018-2019**

This pick may not age well, but as of right now, I don't think anyone else even is a candidate. Nurse just won a championship in his first season as a head coach. The real challenge is next year, but as of right now, you can't argue with results.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, that's my team! I am still mulling whether or not Alvin Williams or Oakley's toughness should be included, but hopefully, Kyle and Marc can take care of that for us.

In my opinion the NBA’s rules regarding the salary cap should prevent richer owners from simply spending their way to a chip’ while preventing cheap owners from cutting corners in order to reduce salary.  The luxury tax incentivizes owners to avoid improving at the margin if they’re already over the cap (which most contenders are). For a contender it’s likely their own MLE was probably already spent keeping guys on their roster and so needing to perform an S&amp;T (their last route to improving) hard capping their team while forcing the owner to pay tens of millions of dollars more than a role player is worth, which can make the difference between winning a title and getting bounced in round two.  I do think that teams should still be able to go over the cap using bird rights, but should not be punished for hitting the hard cap or coming close to doing so.  In my opinion all contending teams should be encouraged to spend most if not all their cap room each season, and obviously the luxury tax prevents this from being the case.

  * Only 16 teams will be created, 1 team for each lotto pick and 2 additional teams representing picks 15-30 and the second round

* **Positions and Peak is Taken into Account**

  * Each player is assumed to be at their absolute peak of their powers

****
There's a trend late in the lotto, teams that are filled with shooters, but lack the athleticism and size of earlier picks, and this team is no different. The starting 5 is a fun, but flawed unit. Each player can hit 3s at a consistent clip. Tim Hardaway (one of my all time least favorite players) is kind of a lost what-if player. From his second season to his fourth he averaged 22.7/4/10 on 46/35/77 shooting splits with 2.2 steals a game. He lost a year of his prime to a pretty devestating knee injury, really took him 2-3 seasons to come back to form, but he was never the same player that he showed flashes of being. Hardaway and Thunder Dan are a pretty great backcourt, two tough players on defense who knock down 3s, basically everything you want from a backcourt. Thunder Dan has the size to match up with most teams best wing player, allowing Peja to hide a bit on defense. Honestly the combo of Hardaway, Thunder Dan, and Peja in their primes is really fun. Opposing defenses are going to have a real hard time limiting the barrage of 3s. 

The frontcourt is the obvious weakness of this team. Troy Murphy, always a fun player to watch, is going to get eaten alive by most bigs in this field, the problem is there just isn't really any alternatives. His shooting ability will at least drag the opposing teams big away from the basket, further opening up lanes for Hardaway to penetrate and kick out to shooters. Morris is a tough player who can switch on most screens and can hit 3s, he's a fine 4 with a true center protecting the rim (something this team doesn't have. 

With no good alternatives with the bigs my thinking was let's just put together a starting unit where everyone can hit 3s and just bomb away. 

A few thoughts with constructing the rest of the roster: 


****
* As I mentioned there just isn't any good bigs available at #14. Here's the list of Fs/Cs who didn't make the cut

 * Anthony Randolph
 * Bam Adebayo
 * Walter Berry (probably a 4 today)
 * Scott Haskin
 * Yinka Dare
 * Al Thorton (also probably a 4 today)
 * Tellis Frank
 * Rich King
 * Earl Clark 

Bam is probably the best player of this bunch, and he's only in his second year. I can see the case of having him in over maybe Maurice Taylor or Humphries, but it's a bit too early. John Henson is the best rim protector on the team and could be a starter (sliding Murphy to the 4 and Morris to the bench), but it's not like he's that great. Maurice Taylor is the most talented offensive player with the bench bigs, which isn't saying a lot. Patterson and Humphries are good situational players, but if they're seeing a lot of burn then you know you're in trouble. 

* TJ Warren is a really good go-to scorer off the bench, he will have to carry this second unit for stretches or even playing the 4 maybe next to Henson with the starters. Dickerson really good have been a good player, he just had his career derailed by injuries. He had a great college career at Arizona and was showing flashes with the Grizz (the Vancouver edition). I do wonder how he would have fit in with Pau, I could see him being a pretty perfect fit. Luke Ridnour isn't a good player, but for whatever fucking reason I remember him torching me in NBA Live 2005, I still don't really understand it. I guess he's a good backup point, but honestly Hardaway is going to play like 38 mins a game so all he needs to do is not be a complete disaster. 




****

Well this brings us to the end of the lotto, and this team is a pretty fitting end for what we've seen with these late lotto picks. A lot of teams that have fun combinations, lots of shooting, but ultimately have serious flaws that will keep them from truly contending. This isn't the best shooting team in the field, but they're going to be very very good. Peja is a guy who missed his era by like 10 years, I can't imagine how good he would be in today's game. Him, Hardaway and Thunder Dan are a really fun core, who can defend a bit, but really just kill teams from deep.

Didn't this Warriors team nearly beat the Raptors in the finals? Remember, this core of Steph-Dray-Klay also destroyed the Blazers in the WCF too and won one game against Houston in the 2nd round. Iggy left, but they also brought D-Lo and more role-players like WCS, Burks, Robinson and their rookies.

Klay is likely to comeback before the playoffs. [His agent said the plan is to return in december](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2843955-report-klay-thompson-undergoes-successful-knee-surgery-to-repair-acl-injury), and I don't think this single ACL injury is going to affect him considerably, and the Warriors tend to be really careful with injured players in the regular season.

Of course, there is the concern on how Russell, Curry and Klay will play together, since D-Lo is a weird fit with this roster, but we also have to remember that Steve Kerr is one of the best coaches of this generation and was capable of integrating a heavy usage guy like KD extremely well to the roster and also managed to make the most of guys like Looney, Draymond and etc. I absolutely believe in him to get the best out of a talent young stud like Russell.

I'd 100% put them on the list of the serious contenders to win the championship next season, specially due to the chemistry this core has and how experienced they are.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,62733,public,self,Are the Warriors being underrated as serious contenders to win the championship next season?,0,1565091047,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cm9sz2/are_the_warriors_being_underrated_as_serious/,,,,,,,,,,

Seen so much arrogance from US fans on just about every forum. If they do happen to win though, good on them! That'll pretty much prove that everything we hear about the world getting better is all just a fairy tale we like to hear being from the rest of the world. 
If the USA get dumped out early, hopefully, it'll restore some national pride to all the A and B grade players that opted out. They won't want to see their country get beaten that easily again so will look to make sure it doesn't happen again and play.

'Woj is one of the most influential journalists in the NBA. However, it is not new to think that ***Woj has symbiotic relationships with front office executives who feed him information about the daily activity of the league in return for writing positive articles even when the said team is not doing well.***\n\nA prime example of this was back in 2008-12, Wojnarowski wrote positively about the Pistons organization. Later on, it is discovered that Woj had almost unfettered access to the Pistons\'  President of Basketball Operations, Joe Dumars. This is detailed in [an article](https://newrepublic.com/article/120572/adrian-wojnarowski-how-basketballs-reporting-machine-gets-his-scoops) about Woj by Kevin Draper in the New Republic\n\nThe access to Joe Dumars was discovered by the NBA in a sting operation detailed in a snippet from Draper\'s article\n\n&gt;In 2010, the **NBA fined Dumars  $500,000** for leaking multiple confidential league memos to Wojnarowski,  according to multiple sources. **This matches the third largest publicly  known fine the league has ever handed down**. The NBA decided that too  many memos were making it into the media, so **they conducted a sting  operation** over several months. They would change a few words or numbers  in different team’s copies of otherwise identical memos, so that when  the memos leaked they could spot the small differences and trace them  back to the leaker. This approach **caught Dumars red-handed**, as well as  an executive from another team who was fined $12,500 for leaking to a  draft-focused website. Joe Dumars, the Detroit Pistons, and the NBA all  declined to comment on the fine.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2012, every article about the Detroit Pistons by Adrian Wojrarowski was absolutely positive\n\n&gt;With Detroit sliding down the standings, Wojnarowski broke nearly every  significant—and insignificant—Pistons story for a half-decade: the Allen  Iverson [trade](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/source-iverson-traded-detroit-165700385--nba.html), the Amir Johnson [trade](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/pistons-trade-johnson-bucks-oberto-233000053--nba.html), [drafting](https://twitter.com/WojYahooNBA/status/2336468947)\xa0Austin Daye,\xa0[signing](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/pistons-reach-deals-gordon-villanueva-225800382--nba.html)\xa0Ben Gordon and Charlie Villanueva,\xa0[hiring](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/pistons-kuester-three-contract-200600140--nba.html) John Kuester,\xa0[trading](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/pistons-trade-afflalo-nuggets-170300086--nba.html)\xa0Aaron Afflalo,\xa0[signing](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/pistons-reach-deals-gordon-villanueva-225800382--nba.html)\xa0Chris Wilcox,\xa0[signing](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/pistons-bring-back-wallace-181100989--nba.html)\xa0Ben Wallace, [drafting](https://twitter.com/WojYahooNBA/status/16971908289)\xa0Greg Monroe,\xa0[signing](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/sources-mcgrady-joining-pistons-135900483--nba.html)\xa0Tracy McGrady, Rip Hamilton [arguing](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/hamilton-center-pistons-turmoil-152200263--nba.html) with John Kuester,\xa0[drafting](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/sources-mcgrady-joining-pistons-135900483--nba.html)\xa0Brandon Knight, [hiring](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/frank-gets-4-deal-pistons-184100753--nba.html) Lawrence Frank,\xa0[re-signing](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/pistons-sign-prince-4-deal-185300023--nba.html)\xa0Tayshuan Prince,\xa0[re-signing](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/sources-stuckey-signs-pistons-three-174500338--nba.html)\xa0Rodney Stuckey, [trading](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/nba--sources--pistons-deal-ben-gordon-to-bobcats-for-corey-maggette.html)\xa0Ben Gordon,\xa0[signing](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/nba--josh-smith-agrees-to--56-million-deal-with-pistons-190432543.html)\xa0Josh Smith,\xa0[signing](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/nba--chauncey-billups-returns-to-pistons-on-two-year-deal-121942513.html)\xa0Chauncey Billups,\xa0[signing](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/nba--pistons-to-acquire-brandon-jennings-in-sign-and-trade-deal-211830240.html)\xa0Brandon Jennings,\xa0[signing](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/nba--source--josh-harrellson-signs-two-year-deal-with-pistons-021539639.html)\xa0Josh Harrellson, and\xa0[firing](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/pistons-fire-coach-maurice-cheeks-165831433.html)\xa0Mo  Cheeks. While Wojnarowski was busy breaking news about the team, he  wasn’t busy analyzing it: Between 2008 and 2012, **Wojnarowski didn’t  write a negative piece about Dumars or the Pistons, despite the fact  that they had transformed from a perennial contender to an also-ran**.  Instead, Wojnarowski penned several sympathetic profiles of Dumars,  including ones that covered his completion of his college degree and  another wholly about his defensive skills as a player in the 1980s.\xa0\xa0\n\nHis coverage of the Pistons was so positive, he even wrote a [fluff piece](https://sports.yahoo.com/news/pistons-iverson-now-lebron-later-230300850--nba.html) on how Dumars trading for Iverson could attract Lebron to Detroit\n\n&gt;The Pistons president doesn’t just have the salary cap space for the Cleveland Cavaliers star. He also has the connections and  the championship credibility. Make no mistake: **Detroit and Dumars are  officially in hot pursuit of James – maybe even the favorite now –** and  it promises to be a long, agonizing two years for the Cavaliers.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Detroit  doesn’t deliver the bright lights and global metropolis destination  that James wants when he opts out of his contract in 2010, but two more  years of watching Kobe Bryant win titles could transform his priorities.  James wants badly to be considered the best player on the planet and  that won’t happen until he’s a champion.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;James wants a front  office with a vision that honors his greatness, and make no mistake:  **This makes Detroit and Dumars so dangerous, makes them Cleveland’s worst  nightmare.** The city could justify losing its prodigal son to New York  or Los Angeles, but nearby Detroit?\n\nWho the fuck thought the Pistons were favorite in the Lebron James sweepstakes? Woj did.\n\nDuring his string of fluff pieces, it was evident that Joe Dumars gave him unrestricted access to Pistons organization. This is probably the time where Woj cultivated a lot of relationships. This includes the **head coach of the Pistons, Lawrence Frank.**\n\nYes, the current President of Basketball Operations of the Los Angeles Clippers. While you may think that it may be a stretch to connect the dots like that, here is some contrary evidence.\n\nLast year, the Clippers made one of the most bizarre front office hires: they [hired Lee Jenkins, a sports journalist](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24717311/sports-illustrated-writer-lee-jenkins-join-la-clippers-front-office) as the  Executive Director of Research and Indentity. As you can see in the byline, Woj broke the story. He also dropped [Woj bomb](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1041871164501442561?lang=en) (duh!) and even hosted Jenkins on his podcast. The article itself allows Lee Jenkins to plug in for the Clippers\n\n&gt;""I grew up pulling for the Clippers on KTLA -- [Gary Grant](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/277/gary-grant)  was my guy -- but it would be disingenuous to say that\'s why I\'m doing  this,"" Jenkins said. ""I just think they\'re a great bet. So much about  sports comes down to market and owner. **They have the most attractive  market in the league, and if they don\'t have the most committed owner, I  don\'t know who does.

I think it\'s inevitable.""\n\nIn his podcast, Woj has hosted Doc Rivers, Michael Winger, Lawrence Frank, Lee Jenkins and Jerry West over the past couple years. During this time, the Clippers coverage in the news media in general has grown increasingly positive. This can be largely attributed to a string of Woj articles ([here](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24733577/jimmy-butler-minnesota-timberwolves-seeking-trade-brooklyn-nets-la-clippers-new-york-knicks) is an example from September 2018), plugs ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2jlviGZKX4) is a YouTube video on how the ""Clippers are challenging the Lakers\' dominance"")  and a splashy tweet here and there on various ESPN platforms. This is despite the fact that LA is still Lakers town (even though Lakers did not make the playoffs for 6 years). This is despite the fact that Blake Griffin, a player with injury history, was traded unceremoniously 6 months after signing a free agent deal with them. This is despite the fact that Lebron, who wanted to come to LA went to Jeanie Buss\'s mom-and-pop shop over the supposedly world class organization like Clippers. And somehow, the Clippers are a free agent destination for a superstars like KD, Klay and Kawhi, all with injury history, all with some big-market ambitions. **Woj pulls for the Clippers so blatantly that when he** [**connected Klay Thompson**](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2834866-woj-on-klay-thompson-watch-clippers-not-lakers-if-warriors-dont-offer-max) **to the Clippers, his fellow journalist at the ESPN, Nick Friedell,** [**dismissed the rumours**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAjXtrx2Bg0) **on The Jump this afternoon.**\n\nWhile there is nothing wrong with breaking stories and building relationships for journalist, it is fair to say that Woj pulls for the Clippers because he get a lot of access to the front office, to the ownership and even to coaches and players. And he pays for the access by writing extremely positive articles and building up the Clippers as the state-of-the-art world class organization and a free agent destination.\n\nSo yes, Woj is a Clippers shill.', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woj is one of the most influential journalists in the NBA.

I think it&amp;#39;s inevitable.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In his podcast, Woj has hosted Doc Rivers, Michael Winger, Lawrence Frank, Lee Jenkins and Jerry West over the past couple years. During this time, the Clippers coverage in the news media in general has grown increasingly positive. This can be largely attributed to a string of Woj articles (&lt;a href=""https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24733577/jimmy-butler-minnesota-timberwolves-seeking-trade-brooklyn-nets-la-clippers-new-york-knicks""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is an example from September 2018), plugs (&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2jlviGZKX4""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is a YouTube video on how the &amp;quot;Clippers are challenging the Lakers&amp;#39; dominance&amp;quot;)  and a splashy tweet here and there on various ESPN platforms. This is despite the fact that LA is still Lakers town (even though Lakers did not make the playoffs for 6 years). This is despite the fact that Blake Griffin, a player with injury history, was traded unceremoniously 6 months after signing a free agent deal with them. This is despite the fact that Lebron, who wanted to come to LA went to Jeanie Buss&amp;#39;s mom-and-pop shop over the supposedly world class organization like Clippers. And somehow, the Clippers are a free agent destination for a superstars like KD, Klay and Kawhi, all with injury history, all with some big-market ambitions. &lt;strong&gt;Woj pulls for the Clippers so blatantly that when he&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2834866-woj-on-klay-thompson-watch-clippers-not-lakers-if-warriors-dont-offer-max""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;connected Klay Thompson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;to the Clippers, his fellow journalist at the ESPN, Nick Friedell,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAjXtrx2Bg0""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dismissed the rumours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;on The Jump this afternoon.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While there is nothing wrong with breaking stories and building relationships for journalist, it is fair to say that Woj pulls for the Clippers because he get a lot of access to the front office, to the ownership and even to coaches and players. And he pays for the access by writing extremely positive articles and building up the Clippers as the state-of-the-art world class organization and a free agent destination.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yes, Woj is a Clippers shill.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'nba', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2qo4s', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/nba', 'subreddit_subscribers': 2570178, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': None, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'thumbnail_height': None, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'title': 'Why it is fair to think that Adrian Wojnarowski shows favoritism for the Clippers', 'total_awards_received': 22, 'ups': 12139, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/c60ygg/why_it_is_fair_to_think_that_adrian_wojnarowski/', 'user_reports': [], 'view_count': None, 'visited': False, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}]",,,,,,

I think this will be the most polarizing team in the tournament, and it the most interesting team to me. Let's forget about Malone and Kobe for a second and spend some time on the rest of the starters. Rose and Jefferson are both good wings who can create their own shots and be effective players without the ball (which will be important on a team with Kobe and Malone). I had a pretty hard time picking the other guard on the team, there's not really any good ""pure"" points available for #13 (guys like Sebastian Telfair, Marcus Banks, Pearl Washington, and Kendall Marshall don't deserve to be anywhere near this team). Mitchell is a better defender the the guard options on the bench and I feel like Kobe would really like his toughness and tenacity. 

Kobe and Karl Malone are the keys to this team, both are All-Time players at their positions and ELITE scorers. Malone isn't a center, but he can hang with most centers in the field given his strength and there's pretty good defensive bigs available on the bench. Obviously the pairing of Bryant and Malone  fell short of expectations (though Malone was hurt and old and Kobe was going through, *personal* issues, but prime Kobe and Malone is a deadly combination. Kobe paired with an elite big has a pretty good track record of success and Kobe would help ease the scoring burden on Malone, especially in crunch time. This team is either going to lose in round 1 or 2 or be in the finals, I can't see any inbetween.

Some thoughts about the rest of the roster.


****
* It's weird how much more talent, even outside Kobe and Malone, were on this team compared to #12. Bookerand LaVine are great scoring options off the bench, both can go nuclear at any time. Derek Anderson is a fine guard, not great. Defense among this group will be a problem though, and the lack of elite wing defenders can really expose this bunch. I went back and forth over Booker or Mitchell in the starting lineup. Booker seems like he should be the better 3 pt shooter, but it's pretty negligible between him and Mitchell. Mitchell's superior defense gave him the edge in my mind.  


* Outside of Malone there wasn't a lot of talent with the bigs. Dale Davis is a good interior defender, even made an All-Star team with the Pacers in 99-00. Both Dale and Ed Davis (the Davii) are solid defensive options off the bench who can come in to help share the interior defense burden with Karl Malone. Olynyk would help to stretch the the floor a bit, either with a small lineup without Malone or a big lineup with him. 

*  Corey Maggette is a great wing scorer off the bench or could be slotted in over Jefferson. Maggette wasn't as good a shooter, but he was elite at getting to the FT line. His lifetime FT rate is .624 is higher than the career high of James Harden (.592) and Giannis (.550), and higher than Shaq (.578). The spacing on the bench with Olynyk, LaVine, and Booker, would allow Maggette to do what he does best and get to the rim. 



****

This team will probably elicit some pretty strong responses, Kobe and Malone are an incredible 1-2 punch and there's enough of a smattering of scoring wings and guards who gives this team a pretty incredible scoring burst. The bigs outside Malone are underwhelming, but they're serviceable. Not sure what the offense on this team would look like, I'm guessing a lot of PnR or iso-ball. I'm very curious to hear what people's expectations for this team will be.

“NEW YORK -- The National Basketball Association announced Saturday that the Salary Cap has been set at $109.14 million for the 2019-20 season. The tax level for the 2019-20 season is $132.627 million.”

https://www.nba.com/article/2019/06/29/nba-salary-cap-2019-20-season-set-10914-million

Rank 7.	Golden State	$128,801,781 (disclaimer: this figure probably is not accurate - due to the recent deal)

https://hoopshype.com/salaries/

With these ideas in mind, feel free to share your info and links; which might explain how teams who have committed so much cap space will go about retooling and signing additional players to fill their roster in free agency. According to the rules of course (even though we all know there are often third party deals which can circumvent these rules). 

Correct me if I’m wrong. Without doing any recent research on the topic and if memory serves me correctly, there is a hard and soft cap. The figure above being the soft cap. Also, you can continue to sign players to the roster if you are under the hard cap. But once that arbitrary level hard cap is reached, you are screwed in terms of signing additional players in a direct way (free agency). Instead you can only indirectly acquire player(s) through trades (which can leverage assets in the future eg. draft picks / also leading to teams salary dumping and offering picks with the bad contracts to get under the hard cap to then sign free agents or create some strange three team deals).

Anyway, if you can fill in any holes that I’ve missed about soft and hard cap rules or have any extra insights, I look forward to learning more. It would be nice to have a thread which can answer most questions relating salary caps. It seems like a really daunting part of the game for the casual and rabid fan to understand and explain, also when the inevitable question comes from someone getting in to watching and enjoying the game, it be nice to be able to explain it simply or at least refer them to somewhere which will answer their questions.

NBA fans watching the Summer League saw some flashes of what his ceiling could be: scoring 28 points off of an efficient 67% shooting in a matchup against the Bulls. I would also like to leave you with what many label [“The Dunk of Summer League”](https://www.nba.com/pelicans/video/teams/pelicans/2019/07/09/2724137/1562677664416-jaxson-hayes-dunk-summer-league-2724137). From this monster vertical, to rangy athleticism leading to defensive hustle, and more, Hayes has the potential to turn into yet another one of the Pelican’s young gems. Let’s dive a little deeper. 

According to Basketball Reference, Hayes’ one year stint at Texas lead to him posting 10 PPG, 5 RPG, and approximately 2.2 BPG while only playing 23 minutes a night. Per 36 minutes, these numbers go to 15.7/7.8/3.4. While his rebounding numbers are certainly underwhelming for a starting center, the blocks should provide fans with some hope. As mentioned, his athletic ability and vertical should be able to translate into a rim-protecting force in the NBA. On top of being a defensive presence down below, his offensive stats are also something to take note of. He shot 73% from the field and 74% from the charity stripe. A concern fans may have is his lack of spacing (he did not shoot any threes), and considering how three-point oriented the NBA has become, they have a right to be worried. Could he be a 10-15 foot spot up mid-range shooter, based on his free throw percentage? Could he develop into a PnR/pick-and-popper dual-threat? As he grows older and adapts more to the NBA, I could see him space out more and more and developing into a respectable three point shooter. 

Looking at the current roster, I don’t see Hayes being the Day 1 starter; that job belongs to Derrick Favors (most likely). What about the backup battle between Jahlil Okafor and Hayes? I do see some similarities between their games (specifically the lack of three point range they both have), but I would give the advantage to Okafor. He is more familiar with Gentry’s system, had a good stretch of games last season that proved he was still a quality NBA role player, and he can hold his own on defense for the most part. In the end, I think it might be a smart move for the Pel’s to sit Hayes out for the majority of the year (playing in the G-League) and then call him up towards the end of the year if they are not contending for a playoff spot. However, I do see the argument for playing Hayes over Okafor. He is more athletic, a better defender around the rim, and fits in more with the youth movement the front office might be looking to exercise. At the end of the day, it’s a toss-up and ultimately lies in how each performs in training camps.

So, here’s my final verdict:
Ceiling: Jonas Valanciunas
Floor: Deandre Jordan

With player power increasing more and more, I was thinking about how RFA could be used to get younger players to their desired destination quicker. So, for example, if Donovan Mitchell wished to leave Utah, he could sign with another team for a 2 year offer sheet. There is no way Utah lets Donovan Mitchell walk for nothing. So Mitchell is pretty much forcing Utah's hand here, forcing them to either a) let him walk in 2 years for nothing or b) trade him on his 2 year deal to cut their losses. Obviously, younger players are more inclined to take the big money, however with player movement at an all time high, I think it's more than likely we see this happening. Of course, the player in this scenario is taking a massive risk, but a 2 year deal allows the player to go to their desired team much earlier than if they signed a long term offer sheet. 
I think for players with extensive injury histories(Embiid, Porzingis, etc.) this option is super risky because they're basically giving up long term big money for at least a year, and a lot can happen in a year, but for a star player unhappy with his team, I think this could very well be another way players get out of an unfavorable situation.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,62624,public,self,"With player movement at an all time high, will we see RFAs taking 2 or 3 year extensions instead of 4 or 5 years?",0,1564968633,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/clqn9h/with_player_movement_at_an_all_time_high_will_we/,,,,,,,,,,

Let me know what you think, and if you have any other trades I’d like to see them. 

TRADE 1: BOSTON
BOSTON RECEIVES: Steven Adams, Andre Roberson
OKC RECEIVES: Gordon Hayward, 2020 BOS 1st round pick, 2022 BOS 2nd round pick
REASONING: Boston simply just needs a better defensive center than Enes Kanter (nothing against him, he just can’t play defense to save his life), and Adams is just that. His defensive prowess and rebounding will bring out the best in Tatum, Brown and Kemba. Roberson is pretty much just a salary filler, but can also help the bench as another wing piece (BONUS REASONING: STACHE BROS 2.0)

TRADE 2: 3 Team with San Antonio, Atlanta
OKC RECEIVES: Patty Mills, Alex Len, 2023 SA 2nd Rounder, 2020 ATL 2nd round pick swap option
SA RECEIVES: Steven Adams
ATL RECEIVES: Marco Bellinelli, Jakob Poeltl
REASONING: OKC can get out of Adams’s salary and gain draft capital, what’s not to like? San Antonio would net a top 12-ish center in the league, someone to complete their ‘Big 3’, and I personally believe that Adams would thrive under a coach like Pop. Atlanta ships out a center who they’re not really going to do anything with in Alex Len for Bellinelli, who’s essentially salary filler, but they also can take a shot on Poeltl, and as he’s young, can develop with Trae, Huerter and company. 

TRADE 3: Miami
OKC RECEIVES: James Johnson, Kelly Olynyk, 2021 MIA 1st round pick swap option, 2024 MIA 2nd round pick swap option
MIA RECEIVES: Steven Adams, Mike Muscala
REASONING: With Miami completing the deal for Jimmy Butler, if they are going to make any real noise in the East, they need an influx of talent that isn’t insanely expensive, such as Steven Adams. Mike Muscala is used as a dollar store-brand Olynyk to incentivize MIA to complete the deal. As for OKC, while they don’t really shed much salary, they gain capital with the option to swap picks with Miami, which can become very valuable.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,62620,public,self,Exploring Trades for Steven Adams,0,1564964321,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/clpwzn/exploring_trades_for_steven_adams/,,,,,,,,,,

Well here it is, the best team I could construct from the #12 picks in the lotto era. Take it in, this is what mediocrity can get you in the draft. Mookie Blaylock is far and away the best player on the team, and a pretty underappreciated guard. He made 6 consecutive All-Defensive teams (2 1st and 4 seconds) and if it wasn't for two of the greatest defensive guards ever (Jordan and Gary Payton) he would have been 1st team each time. He has a good distributor and a pretty good shooter, it's a shame that he's stuck on this awful team. 

Steven Adams was another easy addition, he also brings in solid defense and rebounding, a PnR with Blaylock and Adams would be pretty good. Lamb, Young, and Saric round out the rest of the starting lineup. Thad could be the slotted at the PF position, but I like Saric and Young playing off of each other. Lamb had a pretty good year last season, I feel like he'll come into form as a pretty good wing in the future and honestly, it's not like there is anyone better. 


A few thoughts when constructing the roster

****
* Muggsy Bogues is always a fun player to have on a team, him and Greg Anthony are ok backup guards. I wish I could say that I had more choices, but my hands were pretty much tied. The guards I left off consisted of:
      * Luke Kennard
      * Khalid Reeves
      * Alec Burks
      * Gerald Henderson Jr
      * Miles Bridges
      * Xavier Henry
      * Harold Miner

I can see Kennard and Bridges being on this team in the future, I like both of them quite a bit, but it's probably a bit too soon for them. Gerald Henderson Jr. had a couple of pretty good years on Charlotte, but he's okay I guess. Taurean Prince is another young player who I think will continue to improve so he made the cut as the wing off the bench.
 

* [John ""Hot Plate"" Williams](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/17/sports/pro-basketball-keeping-score-one-pound-at-a-time.html) was a pretty talented big, had a soft touch around the rim, could pass the ball, fairly good FT shooter, but he ate himself out of the league. He is a pretty tragic figure actually who just couldn't put it all together. Collison is the perfect role player off the bench, is able to to do a bit of everything and is a great teammate. Grant and Radmanovic are unremarkable, but fine players. 



****

This team is easily the worst team in the field and would be one of the worst teams in the league. Moookie Blaylock was a good player who could really help a good team, but everyone else is essentially just a role player.

This team is going to do one thing and only one thing really well, and that is bombing 3s from deep. They have 2 of probably the top 5 3pt shooters of all time on the same time (Miller and Thompson) and also Redick, Allan Houston. They will easily shoot 50+ 3s a game and it's going to be glorious. 

Miller and Klay were no-brainer starts, but the rest of the starting 5 was a bit trickier. Terrell  Brandon (an underrated point who had a couple of really good seasons) made it over Allan Houston (which as a Knicks fan is really painful) because of his ability to distribute the ball. Miller and Thompson are going to be running off of screens constantly and they need someone who can reliably get them the ball. Turner was the best center available (which no offense to Myles Turner who is a good player, is a real indictment on this team) and his rim protection and ability to make open 3s is pretty valuable. Horry made the cut for the starting 4, which gives this lineup even more spacing. If this team makes a run it's going to be because they just out shoot everyone else. 


A few thoughts when constructing the roster

****
* Fill out the roster wasn't too difficult, mainly because there isn't much to choose from. Andirs Biedrins was probably the toughest omission, which just about says it all. Guys like Will Perdue, Gary Trent, Mickael Pietrus, Jerryd Bayless, Jared Jeffries, Dougy McBuckets and MCW were never really a thought. I really want to include SGA, but one season just isn't enough to justify his place on this team, but I could easily see him making it next year. 

* At first glance bigs look like the Achilles heal of this team, but honestly Turner, Sabonis, Salley, Hill, Horry are fine. There isn't a elite player among them, but they're all solid to good NBA players who can play some ball. Salley is a good defensive big off the bench who can at least be a plus rim protector. Sabonis over Biedrins may be a bit controversial, but Biedrins is such a net negative on offense that including Sabonis was an easy call for me. 

* Houston, Redick, Anderson, and Bonzi Wells are an interesting selection of wings off the bench. Bonzi Wells isn't a good player, but there just aren't any other wings I would have taken over him. Houston, Redick, Anderson are interesting coming off the bench. Houston can roast opposing teams bench units and spacing would still be great. 

* The real problem with this team is the lack of creators. There's a lot of guys who can score, but not a lot of guys who can create for others. This team might really struggle against some of the elite perimeter defenses in this tournament (thinking specifically of the #2 team with Kidd and the Glove). 

****

This team at first glance looks really good. I mean Reggie Miller and Klay Thompson on the same team is an unreal combination of shooting, and that's not even factoring in guys like Allan Houston, Redick, Brandon, Anderson, Horry, Turner who need to be respected from deep. Ultimately though this team might struggle creating shots against opposing defense. Terrell Brandon is a forgotten PG who had a couple of really really good seasons, made a couple of All-Star teams, but he's the only creator on the team. Opposing teams with lock down perimeter D will cause problems. The bigs are good, but unremarkable. Turner and Salley are good rim protectors, but they can get manhandled at times. This team is just going to have to jack up more 3s than anyone thinks is possible to have a chance.

Klay Thomson spoke today about how he thinks the dubs’ dynasty hasn’t ended and I think that he could be right with the way they’ve managed their assets.

The question is, can they make Steph, DLo, and Klay work together? They’re in a tricky situation with Klay’s injury. They need DLo right now to help them push for playoff position and keep Steph fresh through the year. But there’s undoubtably questions about the fit when Thompson returns from injury and that likely won’t be until around the trade deadline.

*Personally* I like the idea of holding onto him until around Jan/Feb and then moving him for a couple solid “role players”. Golden State still has their homegrown trio of Curry, Klay, and Dray and they undoubtable want to build around them and right now they are sorely lacking in depth compared to the pre-KD days. They can search around the league for a deal and snag multiple guys that fit the team better and will let the splash brothers do their thing.

After getting hired he signed Lebron, but that was likely wasn’t his own doing. His other major moves that year were obviously drafting Wiggins #1 after lucking into the pick and trading him for Kevin Love who Lebron said he wanted to play with. At the time to his credit disgruntled stars weren’t traded for pennies on the dollar like they are now so the actual trade wasn’t bad especially in hindsight. At the time Wiggins was considered to be a generational type of prospect even though he didn’t work out, so all things considered at the time the Timberwolves probably got more value out of the trade.

He then traded Dion Waiters, a few salary fillers, and a 2nd for Shumpert and Jr Smith. This is the one trade where he made magic happen and turned nothing into something. At the time Waiters wanted out and had barely any value.

In 2015 he gave up 2 first round picks for Mozgov who was okay at the time but this was seen as an overpay at the time. At the end of this year the Cavs played the Warriors and lost in a finals where people thought they could’ve won.

Here’s where I believe Griffin deserves far more backlash for. He re-signed Tristan Thompson for a 5 year $82 million contract. Many people thought this was the worst contract given during that offseason. Not only did he overpay Tristan, but he offered 5 years. At the time the Cavs had to pay TT more than other teams would offer to get him to stay, but there was absolutely no reason it had to be for 5 years and no one else would’ve offered that length.

The Cavs ended up winning the championship I. 2016 and to keep their core together he offered Jr Smith a 4 year $57 million contract. It’s the same situation where the overpay was fine, but there was no reason to give that long of a contract. The only way I can rationalize it is that it would expire in the same year as TT. Same story with Iman Shumpert where he was offered 4 years $40 million which was well above market value and too long of a contract.

In 2017 Kyrie Irving ended up demanding a trade and it ended up getting leaked which ended up with Griffin leaving the organization before a trade decision was made. Nobody knows what trade he would’ve pulled off but there were a ton of rumors on what Griffin wanted to do.

Fast forward to his current stint with the Pelicans. Griffin lucked into yet another #1 pick and traded Anthony Davis for a haul similar to what had been offered to the previous GM.

He traded back their 4th pick and grabbed a center which was a position they needed. He also signed JJ Redick which surprised some people.

He’s considered one of the best GMs, but what moves has he made that any of the top half of GMs in the league couldn’t have done?

While this is on the players it is also on the teams, who often don't show loyalty and have the ability to trade players whenever the feel like it. We saw the Clippers compare Blake Griffin to MLK Jr. and say he was the face of the franchise just to trade him six months later.

My solution would be to change contracts to one of two types:

* Tradeable
* Non-Tradeable

Tradeable contracts have a maximum length of two years. In that time the team can trade the player or the player can demand a trade, no harm done. 

Non-Tradeable would be anything over two years. During that time the team cannot trade the player so there can't be any trade demands. This would force players to actually take an interest in the front office and decide whether they want to stay there or not. It would prevent front offices from tricking players like the Clippers did to Blake Griffin. It would cause players to buy in knowing they will be in a location for the next X amount of years.

Every year we see teams selling currently contributing players at the trade deadline so they can commit to losing for the last two months of the NBA season. Basing lottery standings on the league standings before the trade deadline could give a more accurate ranking of how bad each lottery bound team in the season actually is. Of course, some teams might commit to the tank a bit earlier, but I'm not sure a large fraction of teams would be comfortable throwing in the towel for two months. 


This could also eliminate the need for flattened odds, and the NBA could return to lottery odds more similar to the 2017-18 season (i.e. team with 10th worst record at the deadline would have a 4% chance of a top 3 pick rather than a 10% chance). A problem I could see occurring is teams around the 10th seed committing to a last minute tank to improve their chances of drastically moving up in the lottery rather than trying for a playoff push. I could see OKC being in that position this year. Without flattened odds, it might do them better to try to make playoffs and avoid establishing a losing culture to surround SGA.

Another team with really some great wing depth, Joe Johnson, Pierce, PG13 are a really strong starting trio offensively, all great shooters who can also take their defenders off the dribble. The spacing for this starting lineup is great, 4 really good shooters who demand respect from 3. I thought pretty hard about having Lopez in the starting lineup to really maximize shooting, but Horace Grant's defensive ability swung me (although Brook is a perfectly capable defender, especially in the post). All in all this starting lineup is really deadly and has the potential to give a lot of the stronger teams we've seen so far some serious problems.

With all that said I can't help but feel like the coaching for this hypothetical team would be really, really crucial. I can fairly easily envision this offense falling into an iso heavy, your shot then my shot offense. Grant doesn't need touches on offense, and is a fine screener, which does help. PG13 might relish the opportunity to be a shooter (who would get wide open looks) and focus all of his energy on the defensive end and Jason Terry was able to coexist as the second fiddle to Dirk, but without a true distributor this offense could get bogged down. With that said the spacing that this starting 5 provides probably makes up for the lack of a true distributor.

A few thoughts when constructing the roster

Not a ton of guys who I really agonized over excluding them. Sine notable names include Erick Dampier, Lindsey Hunter, Brandon Jennings, Johnny ""Pooh"" Dawkins (weird), Justise Winslow, Austin Rivers, Elfrid Payton, Jeyon Dooling, and Spencer Hawes. I did have Jennings in over Pooh Richardson, but Pooh might be a slightly worse 3 pt shooter, but he's better defensively and is just a better player. It is still weird to me though that this team could have had two guys named ""Pooh""

Lopez and Bynum both have cases to start over Grant. Like I mentioned earlier Lopez's shooting ability with the rest of the starters is a really intriguing proposition. The additional spacing he would provide would allow JJ, Pierce, and PG13 to go to the rim with little opposition. Not to mention that Lopez is a stout post defender who can at least make some of the elite centers in this field work for their buckets. Bynum is such a weird, sad story. He's still only 31 and hasn't played basketball in 4 years. In his last, somewhat, healthy season he averaged 18.7/11.8 with 1.9 blocks a game. If he was able to stay healthy, and somewhat normal, he would be the starter here. Ultimately Grant's defensive presence and ability to be an effective player without the ball won me over.

Eddie Jones, McCollum, and Butler are all great depth off the bench. I suppose Pooh Richardson could be the PG with the bench unit, but I'm sure that McCollum would be able to be an effective primary ball handler. Butler and Eddit Jones are pretty similar players (with the 3 being a larger part of Jones' game) and can both be leading scoring options with bench units.

This team is flawed for sure, but a lot of fun and really talented. A combo of Grant, Thomas, Lopez, and Bynum are great bodies who can be thrown at some of the larger teams in the field. They're all big and strong and should be able to hold their own. Lopez might be the key piece to this team with his shooting ability, which would allow a supersized lineup of JJ, PG13, Pierce, Horace Grant, and Lopez. Like the #9 team the wing depth of this team is exceptional. This team doesn't have the same creators on the wing like the #9 team, but they do have 5 wings who can put up points. Guard play is lacking, Pooh Richardson is fine I guess, but McCollum and Terry are both great offensive players. I do worry about the defensive limitations by the guards on this team, the #4 team with Westbrook and CP3 would eat these guards alive, which would put more pressure on the wings and the bigs to contain penetration.

I really like the potential of this team, I don't see them winning the whole tournament, but they can advance pretty far if the right matchups fall into place

Another team with really some great wing depth, Joe Johnson, Pierce, PG13 are a really strong starting trio offensively, all great shooters who can also take their defenders off the dribble. The spacing for this starting lineup is great, 4 really good shooters who demand respect from 3. I thought pretty hard about having Lopez in the starting lineup to really maximize shooting, but Horace Grant's defensive ability swung me (although Brook is a perfectly capable defender, especially in the post). All in all this starting lineup is really deadly and has the potential to give a lot of the stronger teams we've seen so far some serious problems. 

With all that said I can't help but feel like the coaching for this hypothetical team would be really, really crucial. I can fairly easily envision this offense falling into an iso heavy, your shot then my shot offense. Grant doesn't need touches on offense, and is a fine screener, which does help. PG13 might relish the opportunity to be a shooter (who would get wide open looks) and focus all of his energy on the defensive end and Jason Terry was able to coexist as the second fiddle to Dirk, but without a true distributor this offense could get bogged down. With that said the spacing that this starting 5 provides probably makes up for the lack of a true distributor. 

A few thoughts when constructing the roster

****


* Not a ton of guys who I really agonized over excluding them. Sine notable names include 
*Erick Dampier, Lindsey Hunter, Brandon Jennings, Johnny ""Pooh"" Dawkins (weird), Justise Winslow, Austin Rivers, Elfrid Payton, Jeyon Dooling, and Spencer Hawes*. I did have Jennings in over Pooh Richardson, but Pooh might be a slightly worse 3 pt shooter, but he's better defensively and is just a better player. It is still weird to me though that this team could have had two guys named ""Pooh""

* Lopez and Bynum both have cases to start over Grant. Like I mentioned earlier Lopez's shooting ability with the rest of the starters is a really intriguing proposition. The additional spacing he would provide would allow JJ, Pierce, and PG13 to go to the rim with little opposition. Not to mention that Lopez is a stout post defender who can at least make some of the elite centers in this field work for their buckets. Bynum is such a weird, sad story. He's still only 31 and hasn't played basketball in 4 years. In his last, somewhat, healthy season he averaged 18.7/11.8 with 1.9 blocks a game. If he was able to stay healthy, and somewhat normal, he would be the starter here. Ultimately Grant's defensive presence and ability to be an effective player without the ball won me over.

* Eddie Jones, McCollum, and Butler are all great depth off the bench. I suppose Pooh Richardson could be the PG with the bench unit, but I'm sure that McCollum would be able to be an effective primary ball handler. Butler and Eddit Jones are pretty similar players (with the 3 being a larger part of Jones' game) and can both be leading scoring options with bench units. 







********
 
This team is flawed for sure, but a lot of fun and really talented. A combo of Grant, Thomas, Lopez, and Bynum are great bodies who can be thrown at some of the larger teams in the field. They're all big and strong and should be able to hold their own. Lopez might be the key piece to this team with his shooting ability, which would allow a supersized lineup of JJ, PG13, Pierce, Horace Grant, and Lopez. Like the #9 team the wing depth of this team is exceptional. This team doesn't have the same creators on the wing like the #9 team, but they do have 5 wings who can put up points. Guard play is lacking, Pooh Richardson is fine I guess, but McCollum and Terry are both great offensive players. I do worry about the defensive limitations by the guards on this team, the #4 team with Westbrook and CP3 would eat these guards alive, which would put more pressure on the wings and the bigs to contain penetration. 

I really like the potential of this team, I don't see them winning the whole tournament, but they can advance pretty far if the right matchups fall into place

Some say it's as simple as: take player off of team, see how bad team does without said player.

Other people say it just goes to the best performer on one of the top teams record-wise in the league.

I've always found the first argument to be flawed. Obviously a team will be worse *without* their superstar player. It's a hypothetical game too. 

And for the 2nd one, it's a bit more clear but also not quite true either. Because I can think of a few years were a player put amazing numbers while playing on a 55-60+ win team but didn't win the award such as MJ (1997), Kawhi (2017), Harden (2017), etc. 

But then we go back to the players that ""carried"" their not-so-great teams and still didn't win, like Kobe in 2006 and LeBron in 2018.

But the same maths that tells shooters to sit deep and avoid mid-range shots, is creating a new trend, which is equally logical and much more concerning. Drawing fouls on 3 point field goals.

Let’s fucking learn math. A 40% mid-range shot, is worth on average .8 points. A 35% 3 point shot is worth 1.05 points. A 55% inside shot is worth 1.1 points and if the player gets fouled it’s worth about 1.4 (70% free throw shooting). You get more points being fouled – so the defence is incentivised to defend cleanly. You don’t get so many that it’s worth selling contact to the detriment of your shot. The sport makes sense so far.

But what if the 3 point shooter is fouled? 3 free throws at 70% - that’s worth about 2.1 points. Double as effective as just taking the three. 

The math looks worse on a real life example. James Harden. In 2018-19 he shot the 3 at 37%. An average 3 for him is therefore worth 1.11 points. He shot 88% from the line. A 3 point foul is therefore worth 2.64 points for him. 1.11 points for shooting. 2.64 points if you’re fouled. There’s a defender nearby. What would you do?

The math is pretty clear. If you get near a defender outside 3, and you want your team to win, sell the contact and forget about the shot. 

**So how do we fix it**

What if after getting fouled on a 3 – you either got 2 free throws, or 3 free throws if you take them from the 3 point line. 

You’re still incentivised not to foul on defence – as the free throws are still worth more than the 3 point shot – but on offence you won’t get the same boost from drawing contact. You can still score 3 points if you need to by taking the three shot option. 

It would reduce the number of fouls drawn from deep with few, if any, other consequences on the game imo. I think the NBA should try it out.

Yes, I understand that he was apart of the best team that graced the finals in the 2010's, if not in history, but he suggests that just any other star from history could have done the same which I don't agree with at all. I see no other player scoring like KD did that series on such amazing efficiency (with great defense to boot) outside of LeBron, or MJ.

I really liked the #5 team, I think it's probably better than this team, but this is my favorite team in the tournament. Some of my all-time favorite players (Dirk, STAT, Oak, Matrix) are on this team and there's so much wing/big depth and versatility that I think this is a sleeper candidate to win or at least make a run. The starting lineup is a lot of fun with the amount of offensive firepower and options. A McGrady/Dirk or McGrady/STAT pick and roll would be devastating, I can't imagine many teams having the pieces to check that combination. Dirk and STAT are such a perfect pairing on offense (although the defense leaves a lot to be desired) with STAT rolling to the rim and Dirk spacing the floor. Marion is the ultimate glue guy who can pick up the opposing team's best wing and hit some open corner 3s (awful shot non-withstanding). Prime T-Mac and Kemba are a really dynamic backcourt, both players can go nuclear so fast. This team will be able to keep up offensively with any other team in this field

A few thoughts when constructing the roster

****


* I had Iggy as a starter with Amar'e on the bench and switched back and forth several times. Ultimately Amar'e's peak was too good to ignore, but Iggy's defensive versatility paired with that of T-Mac and Marion is a really intriguing possibility. A lineup of Kemba, Dirk or Amar'e and those 3 wings is terrifying. They would be able to switch on everything and attack defenses in a variety of ways. And that isn't even bringing up Hayward or DeRozan into the mix. The wing depth on this team is exceptional, but there is one flaw. There isn't a knockdown 3 pt shooter among them, Hayward and T-Mac are both good shooters, but they aren't really creating the same type of gravity that other wings do in this tournament. Honestly that's not really that much of a concern to me when you can have 5 different wings who can all score and defend at the level that they do, there isn't another team thus far that can lay claim to this.

* If there is a team that can contain the #1 squad's bigs a bit it would be this team. Oakley, Noah, and Drummond are 3 big bodies that you can throw at Shaq, Duncan, Robinson etc that can at least make them work for their points/boards. The real key to this team is Dirk, he fit with any other big perfectly. Dirk with Oakley or Noah would really allow him to focus on offense and Drummond would be able to clean up the boards for Dirk. This team will succeed based on Dirk's play, which will make them a really tough out.

* Guard play is really lacking here outside of Kemba and some of the wings. The next best guard who could make some 3s was DJ Augustin, which isn't great. He's been a really erratic player, but actually had a pretty good year with Orlando last year. He is a serviceable backup PG to Kemba, but I think you could get away with lineups with T-Mac as the primary ball handler and do just fine.







********
 
I love this team, they can play small, they can play big, they can defend, and they can get buckets. Dirk and T-Mac are a deadly offensive pairing and the collection of talented wings and tough bigs makes this team a true contender IMO.

**Questions We Want To Answer**

If we adjust each of the three players' playoff stats to facing teams with an equal defensive rating, how do their stats stack up against each other? Additionally, what percentage of box score stats did each player get for their respective team?

**Opponent Defensive Rating By Playoff Round - Career Average**

|Round|Jordan|Kobe|LeBron|Average|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|First|105.98|**104.28**|106.45|105.57|
|Conf Semis|105.84|**101.41**|103.88|103.71|
|Conf Finals|103.56|103.02|**102.23**|102.94|

|Finals|**33.0**|25.9|28.1|

&amp;#x200B;

**Using A Simple Metric**

To get each player's statline I'm going to just use something I'll call ""Weight Pulled"". The way this is calculated is just by doing the stat (such as Kobe's points per game in the finals) divided by the team stat (such as team points per game in the finals), to get a percentage (such as the percent of team points in the finals that Kobe scored). We will then multiply that percentage by the stat again, to get an idea of how much weight each player is pulling in a specific stat category. This way, we can properly see the individual level of accomplishment for each player. (For example, this would eliminate the idea that 2 players who score 25 points per game look equal, when in fact one was scoring 40% of his team's points and therefore is more impressive than the other, who might be scoring 20% of his team's points.)

Last season his averages were: 21.3ppg, 9.2rpg, 2.4apg while also averaging a block per game. These impressive numbers are never looked at because Aldridge is not a flashy player, and he’s not always in the media’s face, this partially being the case since he plays in San Antonio.  Also when looking at advanced stats, you can see his PER is 8 points above the league average (15.0) at basically a 23 PER last season.    His true shooting numbers are 58%.

1) C’s just drafted a wing/guard with a similar physical profile/skill set in Langford (long, athletic wing slasher with spotty shooting) who was projected as a top talent and could fill Jaylen’s role off the bench on a cost controlled contract.

2) Jaylen will want a big extension this summer and the C’s are already paying Kemba and Hayward max money. The C’s are $23 million under the tax next year and a JB extension would vaporize any flexibility for next year’s roster, based on the contracts Simmons/Murray just got.

Crossposting from r/nba


One of the most desirable traits in big men is the ability to shoot threes. The idea here is to force opponents to respect you from the perimeter, which gives you more opportunity to take them off the dribble, and stop them from clogging the lane for your teammates. 


In this post, I try to show why AD is considered a good shooter for his position. Despite being below average from 3 (league average was 35.5% this year). If you directly used 3pt%, you would think AD is generating less than a point per 3pt shot, and leaving him open isn't the worst thing. You would be wrong.


**Stats**


The most relevant stat to judge shooting by big men is wide-open 3pt%.  Let's compare AD, Embiid, and Giannis using their 2018-2019 regular season stats. I'll also throw in Brook Lopez as a point of reference, since he's pretty much the ideal floor stretching big man. 


|Name|3pt% (apg)|Wide-open 3pt% (apg)|
:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Brook Lopez|36.5% (6.3)|37.0% (4.1)|
|Anthony Davis|33.1% (2.6)|36.8% (1.9)|
|Giannis Antetokounmpo|25.6% (2.8)|26.3% (2.2)|
|Joel Embiid|30.0% (4.1)|31.6% (3.4)|

So yes, although Anthony Davis only shoots 33.1% overall, he shoots nearly 37% when left wide-open, teams have to respect his 3pt shot. This is not the case for Embiid. At his shooting percentage, giving him a wide-open shot would clock in 0.95 pts per possession, 0.1 worse than the New York Knicks, the worse offense in the league.

This is also why AD, despite being below average from 3, is considered a good 3-pt shooter for a center/power forward. Giannis improved after the all-star break, hitting 30%, but he still isn't quite ready. Embiid is arguably one of the worst considering his volume. Amongst centers who take at least one wide-open 3PA per game, Joel Embiid clocks in at 2nd in attempts, and 24th in percentage. He shoots a lot and makes little. 


**Conclusion**


This post is not intended to be an attack on Embiid, but to show that directly using 3PT% can lead people to draw the wrong conclusions. Having a high percentage is most relevant to these players because it prevents teams from packing the paint against them. Embiid shoots a lot because he has Ben Simmons on his team for example.


If you sag off AD, he'll make you pay. But if Giannis or Embiid pump fake, please don't leave your feet (looking at you Ibaka/Gasol).",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,62270,public,self,"[OC] For dominant big men, the important shooting stat is wide-open 3pt% (or why AD is a good shooter)",0,1564604036,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cjxdl9/oc_for_dominant_big_men_the_important_shooting/,,,,,,,,,,

There has been a lot of talk about how wide open this seasons field of championship contenders is and what this means for league parity. Coming off 3 seasons of the Durant Warriors it's refreshing not to have an overwhelming favorite. This season's current favorite is listed at +350 which equates to an estimated 22% chance of winning the title. I was wondering how rare it was for no team to have even a 25% chance so I put together this chart which makes it very easy to visualize how parity has evolved.

Some Conclusions:

**The level of parity for the 2020 season has happened before, but this is about as good as it gets.** Vegas has been this unsure of the eventual champion during a few other eras since 1985. The Bad Boys won back to back at the end of the 80s but those seasons were very unpredictable by Vegas's standards. We saw the title favorite drop to around 22% for a few years after Jordan's first retirement and then again after his 2nd retirement. After Shaq was traded out of LA in 2004 we saw 5 straight years of this level of parity. We returned to close to the 22% number in 2015 and 2016 before Durant went to GS. Now we have returned to a state of parity in 2020 but it is unclear if it will continue as long as past eras of parity or if one of the top teams will establish themselves as a juggernaut.

&amp;#x200B;

**The super-team era was not a historical anomaly until KD joined the Warriors.** The Miami Heat were not seen as dominant favorites and did not have as high of expectations as the Shaq Lakers, the Jordan Bulls or even the best Lakers and Celtics teams of the 80s. The NBA has mostly varied between a few years with nobody above 25% to a great term emerging and having a few years between 30% and 40%. This held true from 1985 until KD joined the 73 win Warriors in the summer of 2016.

&amp;#x200B;

**The last 3 seasons of the Warriors have been by far the largest preseason favorites the league has ever seen.** We are coming off 3 seasons of the worst parity the league has even seen (since 1985). Vegas gave the 3 Durant Warriors teams a 56%, a 65% and a 63% chance to win. These numbers dwarf even the most dominant Jordan Bulls teams. In terms of the eventual champion being a forgone conclusion this is as close as we have ever gotten.

For example: Klay would be an almost immediate fit on probably any team with his ability to make a huge impact without a lot of time spent with the ball in his hands, but he's too expensive for any team to just pick up without clearing some space.

Vin Baker and Detlef are the two best players and played together in Seattle and were on a 61 win team in 97-98. As a frontcourt this is a pretty solid pairing. Both players can score and Detlef is able to space the flood for Vin. The rest of the starters are solid veterans. Rudy Gay and Andre Miller are solid to good starters and Kittles is a serviceable shooter. This is a solid team overall, which will not bode well for them in this tournament. 

A few thoughts when constructing the roster

****


* Ron Harper could be the starter, but I liked him paired with Crawford off the bench. Harper can help hide some of Crawford liabilities allowing Crawford to do what he does best, feast off of other teams bench units. I went with Miller as the starter because he's a better facilitator than Harper.

* There's a couple of interesting lineup configurations that could be made with Channing Frye's ability to space the floor. You could have a supersized lineup of Harper, Gay, Detlef, Baker, and Frye that wouldn't kill spacing and be okay on defense. 

* There just isn't a lot of talent with the #8 pick unfortunately. The list of guys not chosen for this team is pretty uninspiring, and there isn't a player who has the ability to be a difference maker. If anything this helps to paint the picture that being bad in the NBA isn't worth it unless you're really bad. Guys like Rudy Gay or Andre Miller are fine, solid players who can contribute to winning teams, but towards the end of the lotto isn't a guarantee that you'll get an All Star caliber player.

Outside of Washington, who cares about John Wall?

I would argue that you see more (general) media coverage on Wall because his TEAM has been more relevant since he came into the league\*. Even though its pretty clear cut which guy you would take moving forward.

This team is going to shoot and really push they pace, they're going to be so fun to watch. KJ is a great fit next to Curry, a talented ball handler who will be able to free Steph to work off ball and run off of screens. If the defense focuses too much on Steph then this team has another All-Time great shooter from the Warriors in Chris Mullin. KJ isn't much of a 3pt threat at all, but his ability to get to the rim and kick out will really dole out some damage to opposing defenses. These 3 won't be doing much on defense, but they're all savvy defenders who know how to read passing lanes and come up with turnovers. This team is going to run opposing defenses out of the gym. Nene and Deng are great role players for the starters, good enough on offense that they're not a liability and solid enough defenders that this team won't be completely awful on defense. 

A couple of thoughts when putting together the roster 



****


* This is probably the best shooting team we've seen so far. Curry and Mullin are both elite shooters and Stoudamire and Gordon aren't afraid to hoist 3s off the bench not to mention guys like Barnes, Hamilton (had a couple good 3pt shooting seasons on Detroit on low volume) and Markkanen are also threats from deep. If this team advances in the tournament it's going to be by outshooting everyone else. 

* Like the #6 selection team the bigs leave something to be desired. I went with Deng as the 4 in the starting lineup because of his defensive ability/versatility and his ability to hit open corner 3s. Randle is a good 4 or even small ball center with his many shooters, this is probably the perfect situation for him. If Randle is better on defense this team would be really deadly. Nene is a fine center who can hold his own, but will be overwhelmed when defending some of the elite centers in this tournament. Markkanen may be a controversial choice given his young career, but his outside shooting ability with this team was too intriguing to pass up. The biggest surprise might be the addition of Roy Tarypley, an immensely talented, but troubled center who is a poster child of wasted potential. He was never able to put it together in Dallas, but when he did play (and his play overseas) he showed the ability of a good to excellent center with a soft touch around the basket and ability to grab rebounds and block shots. Tarpley is a forgotten about ""what if"" who in a tournament setting like this could really boost this team's chances. 







********
 
Overall this team is going to be competitive with the shooting it has. Defense and defending opposing bigs will be an issue, but anytime you have this much elite shooting you will be competitive.

I excluded Amare because he wasn't a good defender and the timelines didn't add up well. I chose through 8 seasons as Kawhi has only played 8 seasons and it has the added benefit of excluding PG's 18-19 season. 

Brook Lopez is a bit of a stretch in terms of player type, I just think he would have contributed a similar amount of value to a Lebron lead team as Pippen added to the Bulls, especially if he had developed his 3 earlier.

I think Kawhi is too good of a scorer, although pairing a Jordan type player with a Pippen type player, but this time the Pippen type is the alpha, has a certain appeal.

PG's and Pippen's rate stats and efficiency are eerily similar, so to me this is clearly the best comparison.

I'm expecting the Warriors to return to their 15-16 year game plan with tons of ball movement and have Curry be the focal point of the offense. I'm fully expecting the Warriors to be competitive and *make the playoffs* once again even without KD and Klay out for the majority of the season.

###2019 - 2020: Season###

* This being his contract year I'm going out on a limb that he is going to be giving his all this season in hopes of securing a max in the future. 

* His defensive presence and his energy has always been there. He is the floor general of that team but 15-16 season has been his peak. In the last three seasons he has been getting consistently worse from beyond the arc especially last season where his **3P% was .285**. This hurt the warriors this year in the playoffs where defenses would sag off and focus on Curry/Thompson. 

* With Thompson being out this season and no Iggy/KD the defenses are going to be focusing on Curry. DLo is going take some heat off but he is actually quite bad from beyond the arc. Draymond is really going to have to find his shot if he is going to open up the game for this teammates and himself.

###The Future###

* He is going to 30 years and entering the FA. While he is a versatile player and capable of guarding 1-5; he has definitely lost a step and his athleticism is only going to diminish. He isn't a liability when switched onto guards but last year playoffs Harden would blow by him quite easily. 

* Offensively his best shooting was 3 years ago and he has been getting worse each season. He is great at passing and creating opportunities for his teammates but playing alongside two of the best shooters of all time in an offensive that focuses on heavy ball and player movement is different and going to impossible to replicate outside of GS. 

* It's been often debated on how much impact he would have on a team (outside of GSW). How high can he raise a teams ceiling? The floor? Can he make a playoff team contenders? Can he take a non-playoff teams to the playoffs?

Over the summer, myself and 37 other voters put together a top 100 NBA list. I tasked 37 different fans from all around the world to come up with their own top 100 lists over a month period.

I myself have had a ranking of every player in the league for over 3 years. I came to a point where I realized no matter how good I thought I was a consensus from a knowledgeable group of people is better. 

Anyways, long story short this turned into 2.5 months of creating a free 640 page book that ranks every player in the NBA with individual profiles for each.

It's free, there is no charge, I hope you enjoy and it meets the standards of this sub.

Thanks to all the voters, I hope this meets the standards of this sub.

All the Magic lost were Jerian Grant who was horrible, Isaiah Briscoe and Jarell Martin and replaced those 3 with Al Farouq Aminu, DaQuan Jeffries and Chuma Okeke.

With bigs that bring different skill sets in Nikola Vucevic, Mo Bamba, Khem Birch and Amile Jefferson who is on a two way contract. Magic have lots of ways they can play and have lots of depth at the center position

At the forward position the Magic have Aaron Gordon who is an amazing 2 way all around PF, Jonathan Isaac who finished last 30 games averaging 14 ppg 7 rpg and 2 bpg, Al Farouq Aminu who is a 6'9 PF with 7'3 wingspan and plays amazing defense and will add even more length plus Chuma Okeke who will be redshirting his rookie season but is an amazing shooter, solid passer and great team defender.

At the wings the Magic have Evan Fournier, Terrence Ross, Wesley Iwundu, DaQuan Jeffries, Melvin Frazier Jr lots of length, shooting, athleticsm and two way players.

The PG position if Markelle is healthy like many are speculating would give us Markelle Fultz,  DJ Augustin and MCW who was impressive in his 14 games with the Magic averaging 5 ppg 4.8 rpg 4.8 apg in 18 mpg.

Magic only have 3 players smaller than 6'6 in DJ, Markelle and DaQuan Jeffries. However DaQuan is a freak athlete with a 6'11.25 wingspan and 6'5.25 and Markelle is 6'4 with 6'9 wingspan he is also above average ht and length.

I am hopeful Magic finish top 5 in defense this season and get more steals leading to more fast break opportunities. With Jonathan Isaac being 234 lbs now and Mo Bamba being close to 240 lbs their development along with Markelle Fultz will be key going forward.

But people still think he is in his prime, which I believe is highly incorrect. I saw a post on Snapchat displaying LeBron’s stats from 2013 (his 4th MVP season) compared to his stats from this year somewhat implying that “he’s still got it.” 26.8 PPG, 8 RPG, and 7.3 APG in 2013, 27.4 PPG, 8.5 RPG, and 8.3 APG in 2019. They use this to say that he is still in his prime.

I disagree. He had much more help in Miami. He had a Superstar Guard and an All Star Big Man In Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. And his replacement guard and big man in LA were... Lonzo Ball and Kyle Kuzma. Don’t get me wrong, Ball and Kuzma are good players, but are they any replacement for what LBJ has in South Beach? Not even close. So for me to say that LBJ is still in his prime, he would have to at least be averaging 30 PPG. And now with all star players such as Boogie Cousins and Anthony Davis coming to the team, I think we will get to see LeBron’s true stats and see a big decline from last year. And, if I’m being honest, he might not even lead them in PPG next year (Keyword: MIGHT).

My problem here, though, is his status as a player. I feel like “in his prime” is way out of the water, but “washed up” is a little too much for anyone averaging over 25 PPG, regardless of help around that player.

His free throw percentage didn’t improve at UCF (went down as he got more playing time), and this is a huge red flag. Hack-a-Tacko would likely hurt the Celtics if Tacko can’t hit free throws, making him a completely one side player as a rebounding rim protector. 

The guy is a physical specimen. I find it remarkable that a guy like this can have a hard time in the league just because he can’t hit free throws (a discussion for a later day: why can’t pro ball players hit there freaking free throws!!). So my proposition is simple: go with the tried and true granny shot. His wingspan is so big, 8 foot 2 and a quarter, that the ball is that much closer to the rim to begin with. The Celtics need to get Rick Barry and his son to show Tacko this method! I don’t know if anyone remembers the sports science where they tried this but it makes sense why it works more often. 

Obviously a crazy idea but imagine Tacko in 3 years: one G-league year with some help from Barry, role player minutes (or less) and some shooting improvements from midrange, and another to put it together? Scary to think about I think (not a Boston fan). 

All i’m saying is if is Tacko hitting 70% with the granny shot in two years i would like my credit.

**Only Players Who Were Selected In the Lotto Era are Eligible**




* So only players selected from 1985 on are eligible for this exercise. (See previous posts for more explanation as to why)





**Only 16 teams will be created, 1 team for each lotto pick and 2 additional teams representing picks 15-30 and the second round**







**Positions and Peak is Taken into Account**



* Each player is assumed to be at their absolute peak of their powers

With all that said here is the #6 team:


**Starters**



Player | Position| Career | PPG | RPG | ASP | SPG | BPG | Total WS
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----
Damian Lillard | G | 2012 -  | 23.5 | 4.2 | 6.3 | 1 | .3 | 70.3

**Bench**

Hersey Hawkins | G | 1988 - 2001 | 14.7 | 3.6 | 2.9 | 1.7 | .3 | 90.6

****



Cumulatively this team has:


* **16 All Star Selections**

* **6 All-NBA Selections**

* **2 All-Defense Selections**

* **2 ROY winners**

* **0 DPOY**

* **0 6MOY** 

* **0 MVP**

* **0 HOFers**


This brings us to our first team that doesn't currently have a player in the Basketball Hall of Fame (if Lillard continues his play he has a great chance to make it), also the first team without a MVP on it. This team, while overall pretty solid, is easily the worst team thus far. 

Some positives: The starting lineup isn't awful. Lillard and Roy are as close to an ideal backcourt as you could hope for (sorry Portland fans). They would play off each other perfectly and be incredibly difficult to defend (I think the #2 team would be the best bet so far with Kidd and Payton, that matchup would be really fun to watch). Battier is a perfect glue guy who can guard the other teams best perimeter player and make open 3s. Walker is fine for what he needs to do, which is essentially grab rebounds and hang out at the 3 pt line (which is all he wanted to do anyway. 

And that brings us to Chris Kaman and the glaring problem with this roster....

There are no good bigs taken with the #6 pick in the lotto era. So to show you how little I was looking for here is the complete list of players who were PF or Cs who didn't make the cut

* Willie Cauley-Stein

* Sharone Wright

* Nerlens Noel

* Doug Smith

* Yi Jianlian

* Stacey King

* Robert Traylor

* Ekpe Udoh

* Bryant Reeves 

* Mo Bamba 

* Felton Spencer

* Joe Kleine

* William Beford 

* Jonathan Issac

If I missed someone it's because I was so thoroughly underwhelmed by their career that I forgot about them among a list of forgettable players. 

A couple of thoughts when putting together the roster 



****


* This team isn't going to be good so the only chance I have is to surround Lillard and Roy with shooters and hope to just hoist enough 3s to beat the other team. Outside of Gugliotta and Noel everyone else on the bench is a good 3pt shooter. Gallo could in the starting lineup over Walker, Gallo is a more efficient player, but Walker will be able to help on the boards more which is really needed on this team.

* I went with Kaman starting over Noel, but I'm not sure it ultimately matters much. Noel theoretically is the more versatile defender, but I just see him being manhandled by the other starting bigs in the tourney. As far as what bigs to pick for the team I was at a lost. Gugliotta and Kaman were at least both All-Stars at some point and Noel vs WCS is a tossup. You know the team isn't good when I went back and forth over whether or not to include Bryant ""Big Country"" Reeves on the team






********

This is first team where he can see the steep drop-off. There's a couple of really good teams left, but mostly it's either outright bad teams or teams with 1 or 2 stars that very flawed. I think this experiment will ultimately show why it's so important to be either really good in the NBA or drafting high in the lotto.

* **38 All-NBA Selections**

* **25 All-Defense Selections**

* **3 ROY winners**

* **1 DPOY**

* **1 6MOY** 

* **1 MVP**

* **3 HOFers**


I'll be honest, this is my favorite team thus far. I don't have a true PG in the starting lineup, but I don't think I need one. Wade is capable of bringing the ball up, and each starter is capable of creating their own shot or creating for others. The defense potential on this team is pretty enticing, the starters would be able to switch everything and imagining a prime Wade, Pippen, and Garnett wrecking teams defensively is terrifying. Carter and Allen are able to help space the floor, allowing Wade to really go off on teams. 

This team is absolutely electric. 

****


A couple thoughts on my thinking when constructing the roster:



* Wade and Garnett are such a great duo on both offense and defense. Garnett is basically a souped-up Bosh, on both offense and defense. The bigs on the bench are talented offensive players, but all leave a lot to be desired on defense. This puts quite a bit of stress on Garnett, but with all the shooting and scoring on this team, he will be able to focus on defense. 

* I really wanted to find a way to put Fox on this team over Rubio, but 2 years isn't enough of a sample size for me (any future iterations would almost certainly have him on this squad. I do like Rubio's fit for this team, there's a lot of shooters for him and his perimeter defense would be valuable off the bench.


* Lots of shooting off the bench with Smith, Richmond, Miller and Love, helping to create a wide variety of lineups to use. 





********

This is my favorite team in the whole tournament I think. Wade ,Pippen and Garnett are a great Big 3 to build around and there's enough other shooters on this team to help space the floor.

Here's an excerpt:

&gt;But what quickened Spellman’s weight gain was inactivity — yes, even during an NBA season.

&gt;In the pros, the practices are shorter than in college and Spellman saw a drastic reduction to his playing time. In 2017-18 at Villanova, Spellman averaged 28 minutes per game but saw that number fall to 17 minutes as a Hawk.

&gt;Plus, constant air travel means constant sitting; jet lag, time zone changes and sleep deprivation are known to wreck the metabolism.

This story got me thinking...young NBA players have challenges on the road, as mentioned above. Teams often prioritize their role as a traveling member (often in name only, as they may not play much) of the team over their personal development.

My next thought is of Dragan Bender, a player who recently signed with my Bucks. Bender, to my knowledge, always traveled with the Suns, and played 82 games his sophomore season (when he was 19/20 years old). Bender at the time was far too weak and skinny to play a big man's role, and was lacking in his skills as well. Furthermore, he was on a team that had zero playoff hopes past the first week of the season. Why was he with the team the entire season, spending all that time sitting on planes/buses, getting inconsistent sleep, and in unfamiliar workout environments when he could have periodically missed road trips to do rigid and scheduled weightlifting, practicing, and more in Phoenix? Playing in games is valuable to improvement, but there's diminishing returns over a whole 82 games. 

Bringing this conversation full-circle, I believe there's a lot of players (I felt this way about Thon at a time) who could benefit from being treated as ""part-time"" roster players while they're very young and have serious work to do on their body and skills in the gym/practice facility, rather than being on the road and present for every game of a season that's nearly 3x as long as what they did in college with just one serious break (All-Star). Spellman appears to be one example of a player whose personal development was hurt by participating in the NBA travel and game schedule as a young player still building himself, and I don't think he's alone.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,61929,public,self,Recent story of Omari Spellman's weight issues during the NBA season make me question the handling of developing young players as permanent/consistent members of the active roster,0,1564297038,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ciedn1/recent_story_of_omari_spellmans_weight_issues/,,,,,,,,,,

Jovan Buha and Sam Amick broke down the whole saga of the Clippers deals and it has some damning quotes about the intentions of the OKC front office and the direction of the franchise pre-PG13 trade.

&gt; Around the time of the draft, Russell Westbrook and George both communicated their discontent to the Thunder and expressed interest in the franchise possibly making significant changes, league sources told The Athletic. There had been frustration yet again at season’s end, with the Westbrook-George pairing falling short in the first round of the playoffs for a second time. It would only be natural that all options were considered.

&gt; When George went to the Thunder and informed them that he wanted to go to the Clippers, it changed everything for Oklahoma City. He was the domino. From there, Westbrook and his agent, Thad Foucher, engaged in discussions with Presti about what it all meant. Eight days later — and six days after the report of George being traded to the Clippers — Westbrook had been dealt to Houston.

&gt; **Yet one rival team indicated to The Athletic that the Thunder were willing to discuss the prospect of trading Westbrook leading into the draft, with that revelation seen as a sign that they were considering changes even before George made his move.**

The Thunder were a luxury tax team that had come off 2 seasons of first round exits and their second star had to have double shoulder surgery, something that gets rarely mentioned around here. If these reports are true, the Thunder had already started considering their franchises future and were open to a rebuild prior to PG requesting a trade. It is extremely difficult to believe Presti's comments yesterday, if the idea of a rebuild was solidly in the minds of the Thunder FO and their two star players.

There were multiple signs pointing to a rebuild, but nobody seems to be talking about the tax implications for the Thunder and how that shaped their decision making.

- The Thunder were projected to be a luxury tax team for their 3rd year in a row, and 4th time since 2015. Last year they had the **largest tax bill of any NBA franchise** at [61.6m](https://www.hoopsrumors.com/2019/04/five-teams-finish-201819-season-in-tax-territory.html). Immediately after the PG trade was made, the Thunder moved to get under the tax by trading Grant into Denvers cap space. It's safe to say that no owner would be jumping for joy in having to pay the highest tax bill of any team, only to be a WCF team at best.

Their two star players didn't seem at all content with the direction of the team and had already voiced their concerns over it, something that has seemingly slipped through the cracks in this story. I can understand why a FO would prefer to look like they had no idea or were completely blindsided by one of their star players requesting a trade, but it seems highly unlikely that's the case. Presti and the FO come out of this looking much better if blowing up the team and rebuilding (in a small market no less) came as a surprise and was totally out of their control.

TL;DR: Westbrook and PG had expressed their concerns prior to the trade and OKC was reported to have been willing to discuss a trade for Westbrook around the night of the draft. For a team paying heavy money in luxury tax, the thunder had clearly thought about rebuilding and there's no way they were blindsided by how this summer unfolded.",False,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,61876,public,self,Why Sam Presti's comments about OKC's desire to trade PG should be taken with a grain of salt,0,1564253514,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ci6ukw/why_sam_prestis_comments_about_okcs_desire_to/,,,,,,,,,,

They correctly attribute the rise of small ball not to the Warriors (like many casual fans tends to do) but the Big 3 Era Miami Heat, which started Bosh at center and Battier at power forward, they also give a brief shot out to the forerunners, like the 7 seconds or less Suns.

More interestingly, they point out that many teams seem to be rembracing the traditional 2 big lineup this coming year.  I don't think that necessarily means we'll see the end of small ball, but more speaks to the difficulty in finding personnel that fit that scheme.  Quite simply, its much easier to find traditional bigs that it is to find people like Draymond, Battier, or Bosh who can defend opposing bigs and be effective at stretching the floor on offense.  Teams can't find these people, but can find bigs like Horford, WCS, AD, Boogie, etc, who are likely going to play in 2-big lineups.

There is one more key element here though that this 538 article completely misses, and that is that traditional bigs are now utilizing skills traditionally reserved for wings - they can dribble, bring the ball up, and shoot 3s.  You don't need to play a small ball center to stretch the floor, when your traditionally-sized center (like Embiid) can already stretch the floor.  It seems that it's not necessarily the end of small ball, but more like bigs are embracing and gaining those skills that small-ball 5s and 4s are prized for.  The 2-Big lineup may be returning, but only because those bigs learned to play small.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,61863,public,self,The return of the 2-Big Lineup?,0,1564245162,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ci53r6/the_return_of_the_2big_lineup/,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '7bfS2r4UhPweOwAgbvvIQv2FD47ThYZNQSxY5zLXy8Q', 'resolutions': [{'height': 60, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/UGks49_9NIba-FLpGlXO9AaL0pPTR2-xWKq_Jn9zeUo.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=702721971a9b03b2ca711edc7ac39c903ea2167f', 'width': 108}, {'height': 121, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/UGks49_9NIba-FLpGlXO9AaL0pPTR2-xWKq_Jn9zeUo.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a393d9850603a9a56bcf34a30fddf8d3047b4a8', 'width': 216}, {'height': 180, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/UGks49_9NIba-FLpGlXO9AaL0pPTR2-xWKq_Jn9zeUo.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e61af93d114a615af949aa3898ef001936a6d9f9', 'width': 320}, {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/UGks49_9NIba-FLpGlXO9AaL0pPTR2-xWKq_Jn9zeUo.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4414ea737b3c709cd26a60a90b867795b2a7eed8', 'width': 640}, {'height': 540, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/UGks49_9NIba-FLpGlXO9AaL0pPTR2-xWKq_Jn9zeUo.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db250bdbcdf9e97bef4180c8052fb66b083855ac', 'width': 960}, {'height': 607, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/UGks49_9NIba-FLpGlXO9AaL0pPTR2-xWKq_Jn9zeUo.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=594946d093118cc5976dbbe7a752482996757390', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 900, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/UGks49_9NIba-FLpGlXO9AaL0pPTR2-xWKq_Jn9zeUo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=27ad009d06871567d01a0e2ba24695cf4201ea65', 'width': 1600}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,

MVP - Kawhi Leonard
6MOTY - Montrezl Harrell
Best Offseason Move - Paul George
Worst Offseason Move - Losing Shai Gilgeous-Alexander

Analysis:
I firmly believe that the Clippers are the best team in the league. Other teams like the Lakers, Bucks, Nuggets, and Jazz are close, but this looks like potentially one of the best defensive teams in NBA history. I really don’t know who’s gonna have dominant outings against Pat Bev, Kawhi, PG, and Montrezl. The Lakers-Clippers games should be good and close and I think the Lakers and the Clippers will eventually meet in the postseason. With everyone healthy, I think it’ll be at least a 6 game series. Not that Paul George won’t have a good year, but Kawhi is going to come out and put on a SHOW in LA. He will be a Top-3 MVP candidate. Lou Will is aging and he’ll slightly regress. Luckily for the Clippers, Montrezl Harrell is still only 25 and has even more room to grow after a finish in the Top-3 as a 6MOTY last season. The reason I listed Paul George as the best move, and not Kawhi, is because without Paul, you don’t get Kawhi. The people that say the Clips gave up too much for Paul aren’t thinking about they fact they virtually traded those picks and players for Paul AND Kawhi. The road to the finals will run through The Staples Center this year, but this time it won’t be the Lakers moving on.

MVP - Kawhi Leonard
6MOTY - Montrezl Harrell
Best Offseason Move - Paul George
Worst Offseason Move - Losing Shai Gilgeous-Alexander

Analysis:
I firmly believe that the Clippers are the best team in the league. Other teams like the Lakers, Bucks, Nuggets, and Jazz are close, but this looks like potentially one of the best defensive teams in NBA history. I really don’t know who’s gonna have dominant outings against Pat Bev, Kawhi, PG, and Montrezl. The Lakers-Clippers games should be good and close and I think the Lakers and the Clippers will eventually meet in the postseason. With everyone healthy, I think it’ll be at least a 6 game series. Not that Paul George won’t have a good year, but Kawhi is going to come out and put on a SHOW in LA. He will be a Top-3 MVP candidate. Lou Will is aging and he’ll slightly regress. Luckily for the Clippers, Montrezl Harrell is still only 25 and has even more room to grow after a finish in the Top-3 as a 6MOTY last season. The reason I listed Paul George as the best move, and not Kawhi, is because without Paul, you don’t get Kawhi. The people that say the Clips gave up too much for Paul aren’t thinking about they fact they virtually traded those picks and players for Paul AND Kawhi. The road to the finals will run through The Staples Center this year, but this time it won’t be the Lakers moving on.

Russ take a lot of heat every year for putting up MVP stats during the regular season but OKC always struggles in the playoffs. They got bounced in the first round for the last two season.

He isn't an elite play maker but his assists to turnover stats are not impressive at all. We can say that he has been coming off a shoulder injury which probably affected his shot but let's look at the season before this...

This may be the most frustrating team for me, there's so much on this roster that I love. I love the bigs on the team and everything they bring to the table. There's a lot of forwards who can create their own shot and shoot the ball, this team has a great deal of flexibility, and yet there is one problem that has thrown me for fits; what the fuck do you do with Westbrook. 

I want to get this out of the way, I think Russ is one of the greatest players of his generation. I've never quite seen anyone like him, he's like the Tasmanian Devil on the court, a blur of energy and athleticism unlike anyone I've ever really seen. I love his competitive spirit and I love that he probably isn't human, he's a basketball terminator. *But what the fuck do you do with him?* Starting him next to CP3 is almost assured to be a disaster. I think he would actually see two teammates get in a fist fight on the basketball court, but what are you going to do have Russell fucking Westbrook come off the bench??? Conley can probably slide next to CP3 pretty easily, and Mike Conley is a really good player. I thought about having Dennis Scott on the team (maybe over Jamison or Mashburn) and starting him, but then I remembered I was going to bench Russell Westbrook for Dennis Scott. 

So I have Russ and CP3 as the starting guards, it's not going to work, it doesn't make a ton of sense, and yet I feel like my hands are tied.

****


A couple thoughts on my thinking when constructing the roster:



* A couple tough omissions for me, Dennis Scott, Aaron Gordon, Shaun Livingston, Donyell Marhsell, Xavier McDaniel, but I really like this roster. The real strength of this team are the bigs. We have two elite rim protectors in Mutombo and Porzingis, and then two great team defenders in Bosh and Wallace. Any combo of these bigs would work great, as at KP, Bosh, and Wallace all can stretch the floor. I think the #1 selection team would eat these guys for lunch (no offense to Mutombo, but I will never forget Shaq doing [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-mD0t9E3CQ) to Mutombo during the Finals. But any other team in the tournament is going to have a tough time at the rim and defending these guys.

* Dennis Scott was the hardest omission for me, he shooting could really be used, but I feel like almost everyone else is a good enough shooter that it's a non-issue. I really like Marbury and Conley off the bench, they really compliment each other as players and it frees Marbury to just feast on other bench units. Guards overall on this team aren't very big and will struggle guarding guys like T-Mac, Kobe, Vince etc. I'm banking on the frontcourt being able to mitigate that to a degree.



* A lot of really versatile forwards on this team who can play the 3 or the 4 and not hurt your spacing too much. I thought about having Odom in the starting unit with Bosh at center, but Mutombo is a pretty perfect pairing with Bosh. This team has a really fun big lineup that could be like CP3, Rice, Odom, KP, Bosh that would be devastating on offense.

So far the first 4 teams all present really interesting matchup problems for each other, all are really strong teams, but the dropoff is coming....

1. Milwaukee- I feel like this is too good of a team to regress. Losing Brogdon sucks, but Giannis is only going to get better, and they returned everyone else. Also, watch out for DiVincenzo as a sleeper this year. 

2. Philadelphia- Arguably the best starting 5 in the league. I believe Simmons and Embiid both take steps forward, and I love Richardson and Horford on this team.m, potentially making it the best defensive team in the league. My main concerns with this team are lack of depth and crunch time offense. Their bench is pretty good, with the best player being Mike Scott in a likelihood. Zhaire Smith could emerge and I really like Matisse Thybulle, but I wouldn’t count on anything major from them. As for crunch time scoring, last year their whole offense at the end of games was either Butler isos or Redick/Embiid two man games, so there will probably be growing pains with both Redick and Butler leaving.

3. Boston-  I am higher on Boston than most, so I can understand the argument having them lower. Starting off, I do not like Enes Kanter as the starting center, because of his lack of defensive prowess. However, I expect big jumps out of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, with a somewhat bounce back season from Gordon HaywardWhile Kemba is a downgrade from Kyrie talent wise, I believe he is a better fit for this team. If they would have kept Horford, they would have been very close to Milwaukee 

4. Brooklyn- I believe Kyrie Irving will strongly benefit from a change of scenery and will have a lot to prove this season. I like Joe Harris a lot, and Caris Levert was probably going to be an all star before he got hurt last year. I hope they start Allen over Jordan and I also believe Kurucs is really underrated. In addition to the starting lineup, they have arguably the best backup PG in Dinwiddie and also whoever isn’t starting between Jordan/Allen off of the bench

5. Indiana- They could be interchangeable with Brooklyn. This team has to just weather the storm, while Oladipo is out, and go on a run when he comes back. I had heard me might be back by Christmas, but I could be totally wrong. Losing Bogdanovic, Collison, and Thad Young hurts, but they did a decent job replacing them with Brogdon, Lamb, and Warren.

6. Toronto- This team will not be able to replace Kawhi and Danny Green. They will still be one of the best defensive teams in the league, adding RHJ and Stanley Johnson will only help that. However, they will struggle offensively, even with the leap to all star level that I am expecting out of Pascal Siakam.

7. Atlanta- This is my going out on a limb pick to make the playoffs. Last year it was Brooklyn, and I was right. Anyway, I absolutely love this young core. Trae Young and John Collins could both be borderline all stars, and Kevin Huerter is really underrated. I love the fit of DeAndre Hunter on this team, and Cam Reddish is a wild card. Losing Dedmon hurts, but I feel they will be fine without him. 

8. Miami- Replacing Josh Richardson with Jimmy Butler and getting a healthy Goran Dragic puts this team into the playoffs. I expect Bam Adebayo to make a leap this season, and Tyler Herro is one of my favorite rookies this year. 

9. Detroit- This might be the most mediocre team in the league. I have my doubts they will make the playoffs just because 2019 Blake of the Year winner, Blake Griffin had his first healthy season in a while.

10. Orlando- I do not think Vucevic is as good as he was last season. I expect Jonathan Isaac to improve but his fit next to Gordon isn’t the best. I also cannot trust a team starting D.J. Augustin at PG. 

11. Chicago- As a Bulls fan, there has been a lot of playoff buzz, but I do not see it. I expect Zach Lavine to put up similar numbers as last year, and Lauri Markkanen and Wendell Carter Jr, to make leaps. Also, for the first time in a while, I am relatively happy with our offseason moves. I believe this team is one year away, because Coby White is a year away from being a starting caliber PG, in all likelihood. 

12. Washington- If Bradley Beal gets traded this is probably the worst team in the league

13. Cleveland- Year 2 of Collin Sexton and healthy Kevin Love will be nice, but will not add very many wins. I am not sold on Darius Garland, but I really like Dylan Windler

14. New York- Nice young core, probably a year or two away from making any noise. Mitchell Robinson is a DPOY in the making and R.J. Barrett is potentially an all star in the making. Even without landing marquee free agents, there is a lot to be excited about if you are a Knicks fan.

15. Charlotte- Didn’t make the playoffs, and lost their two best players. Who is the best player on this team, Terry Rozier? 

West

1. Denver- This team is dangerously underrated right now. They were the second seed last year and started 3 guys under 25 years old. Nikola Jokic is my pick to win MVP and I expect Jamal Murray to be a borderline all star this year. I also LOVE the additon of Jerami Grant to this team. Michael Porter Jr. is the ultimate wild card.

2. L.A. Clippers- Replacing SGA and Gallinari with Kawhi and Paul George speaks for itself, and I am very high on SGA. This will be one of the best defensive teams in the league, and they have the best first two guys off of the bench in Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell.

3. Utah- First, Mike Conley replacing Ricky Rubio is a massive upgrade. Bojan Bogdanovic will give then much needed spacing on offense. Losing Derrick Favors hurts, but they added Ed Davis, who I believe is about 80% of what Favors was, which is fine off the bench. I believe Donovan Mitchell will be an all star this year, and they will have Rudy Gobert, the best defensive center in the league.

4. L.A. Lakers- Pairing Anthony Davis with LeBron speaks for itself, however this team may struggle defensively. Also, I expect Davis and LeBron to miss several games, managing their load. A starting lineup of LeBron/Danny Green/Kuzma/Davis/Cousins has disaster potential defensively. However, LeBron/AD alone gets them to a top four seed, in my eyes

5. Houston- I am a bit skeptical of Russell Westbrook’s fit on this team, but his talent paired with James Harden gets this team to the playoffs. However, I do not see this team being any better than last year.

6. Portland- Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum alone get Portland to the playoffs, and I expect Zach Collins to make a big leap. I am have a very bad feeling about Hassan Whiteside, so they have to weather the storm until Nurkic is back. Anfernee Simons will also be a good bench guy if he is unleashed.

7. Golden State- Without Klay Thompson for most of the season, Stephen Curry will have to put up MVP level numbers. D’Angelo Russell isn’t the best fit, but I believe Steve Kerr will make it work. Draymond Green will have a chip on his shoulder this season, in a contract year. I also really like the addition of Willie Cauley-Stein 

8. San Antonio- I originally had them missing the playoffs but returning Dejounte Murray and being a Gregg Popovich coached team, its hard to see them out of the playoffs. DeMar DeRozan and LaMarcus Aldridge are both all star caliber players. Lonnie Walker also looked incredible in summer league. The main issue with the Spurs is three point shooting but I believe it is somewhat offset by the fact that they will get after it defensively. 

9. New Orleans- Another team that will get after it defensively, and Zion is the clear ROY, in my opinion. A potential starting lineup of Lonzo/Jrue/Ingram/Zion/Favors would maybe mean Zion would be their worst defender in that lineup, which is scary to think about. The issue with this team is three point shooting, although J.J. Redick will help with that, and overall scoring.

10. Sacramento- I am expecting big leaps out of De’Aaron Fox and Marvin Bagley this season, but I do not think it will be enough for a playoff appearance. It isn’t so much that they got worse, it is just almost everyone in the West got better they did not get a whole lot better. 

11. Dallas- One of the biggest losers this offseason, by not surrounding Doncic and Porzingjs with a third all star caliber player. With that being said, I believe Doncic and Porzingjs are borderline all stars.

12. Oklahoma City- This obviously changes if Chris Paul gets traded, but I believe this team will be very competitive. SGA, Gallinari, and Adams are all solid players

Side Note: Whatever happened to Andre Roberson? 

13. Minnesota- They have guys who can score the ball in Karl Anthony Towns, who I believe would be an MVP candidate on a better team, and Andrew Wiggins, albeit very inefficiently. This team could also be sneaky good defensively with Covington and the addition of Jarrett Culver. However, their lack of starting PF and bench will be their downfall. 

14. Phoenix- Devin Booker and DeAndre Ayton are two building blocks, and Kelly Oubre is solid, but I do not like much else on this team. Hopefully, Monty Williams will be given more than one year.

15. Memphis- I really like this young core of Ja Morant, Jaren Jackson Jr., Brandon Clarke, and Grayson Allen, but this team is going to really struggle in the West.

1st Round
Milwaukee over Miami in 5- Giannis will be too much to handle for Miami, in addition to Middleton and Bledsoe.

Philadelphia over Atlanta in 5- This could be a similar series to Philadelphia/Brooklyn in the first round last year, with Philadelphia winning.

Boston over Toronto in 6- This would be a potentially really ugly series but Boston having more options offensively puts them in the second round. 

Brooklyn over Indiana in 7- This is a toss up, which could come down to who is better between Kyrie and Oladipo

Denver over San Antonio in 5- The experience of last season for Denver makes it a much quicker series this time around. 

L.A. Clippers over Golden State in 7- The Clippers may struggle with teams that have good defensive wings and an active big, so that is why I think this drags to seven.

Utah over Portland in 6- This would be a very good series in two raucous in environments but I think Utah is the better team here.

L.A. Lakers over Houston in 5- I think L.A. takes the first two at home and Houston somewhat throws in the towel.

Second Round

Milwaukee over Brooklyn in 5- The Nets have no one that can contain Giannis

Philadelphia over Boston in 5- I would expect Joel Embiid to have his way with Enes Kanter

L.A. Lakers over Denver in 7- This would be an absolute war, but you cannot bet against LeBron in a Game 7, against a team that has no where near the experience he does

L.A. Clippers over Utah in 7- this will be very similar to the Warriors series, for the Clippers, but I do think they prevail

Conference Finals

Milwaukee over Philadelphia in 6- The Bucks have the best player in the series and much better depth.

L.A. Clippers over L.A. Lakers in 6- I have gone back snd forth with this one, but the two way ability of the Clippers will prevail here for now.

The consensus seems to be that durant is still better than Giannis despite Giannis posting a historically great regular season and having a strong playoffs where he led role players to the conference finals and narrowly lost to the champs.

What is durant's argument over giannis in 2019?

\-&gt; Giannis went 12-5 in the playoffs with role players who, a single rookie of the year aside, haven't experienced any degree of great success. Durant went 6-4 with Steph Curry, a b2b mvp,  whose led the league in scoring, effiency, box creation, +/-, and on/off at various points during the last 5 years and Draymond Green, a dpoy whose led the league in postseason defensive stats for the last 5 seasons.

\-&gt; Giannis was the centerpiece for his team's elite offence and elite defense, Durant cocaptianed  his team's offence. Giannis's team posted a 10+ srs while durant's posted an srs of about 8.

\-&gt; Giannis killed durant in rs advanced stats and had better postseason advanced stats

So, I'm trying to imagine what moves I'd make as the Rocket's GM to ensure this team gets the proper shot.  

----

Rockets Send:  
Clint Capela, Eric Gordon, 2020 1st round pick 

Raptors Send:  
Marc Gasol, OG Anuoby  

----

Why for the Rockets? 

Rockets get a veteran, champion and overall currently superior center in Marc Gasol.  He brings championship pedigree, and high IQ playmaking and defense to the center position.   They also get OG, who could start at forward alongside Tucker to make one of the more scary 3&amp;D forward tandems in the NBA.  

Westbrook / Harden / Tucker / OG / Gasol  
Rivers / Green / House / Clark / Chandler   

Why for the Raptors? 

Raptors get Clint Capela who fits perfectly alongside Siakam and also fits Siakam's timeline.  Not only that, but he's on one of the best contracts in the NBA and locked up for 3-4 more years (I'd have to check).  They also get Eric Gordon, who would compliment Kyle Lowry so well in the Raptors backcourt.  The additional picks are the other prize here.  Point is, the Raptors don't get much worse, arguably they get better and also acquire a 1st round pick.

KD. Kawhi. PG. Jimmy Buckets. Long, switchable, suffocating wings that can be your number 1 option  are arguably the most valuable resource in the NBA, and the guys on this list have the accolades, hardware, and championship chops to back that assessment up. So who are the next wave of two way wings to establish themselves and there teams as contenders for the crown? Here are my 5 favorites to ascend into that elite status, counting down to my favorite to be the best of the bunch:

5. Devin Booker: Booker barely budges in here ahead of Jaylen Brown, who is a superior defender and athlete but an inferior scorer and playmaker, and Booker seems like he could play with anyone in really any lineup. With the point Booker experiment seemingly scrapped, as the Rubio signing seems to indicate, Booker will be relieved of some of his offensive workload. If he can redirect the energy he was expending there to efficiently picking his spots on the offensive end and increased effort and emphasis on the defensive side of the ball, he could pass Ingram relatively easily. The potential ceiling of a core with him and Ayton if the two of them can just be passable on D I think is one of the best and most malleable two man foundations in the league. But right now the organization seems marred in dysfunction and rudderless, to the degree that the toxicity of the organization stunts or even sabotages their development. Favorite SAS absurd rant, Devin Booker should arranged to have himself kidnapped to escape Phoenix. 

4.  Brandon Ingram: Ingram is the longest and definitely the thinnest of my 5. That length significantly raises his floor in several areas of his game, defense, rebounding, pulling up and creating a clean look over the contest. He hasn't lived up to pre-draft comparisons to KD (not many ppl can), he has flashed a lot while on the Lakers and I think all of the outgoing Lakers will benefit just from the roster construction and timeline of the Pelicans and the lack of spotlight. And Ingram is a great compliment to Zion as the other forward stylistically , and will likely default into number 1 option on offense for this team. I think Ingram is the least likely to be at the top of this list, but also the safest bet to be in this tier

3. Donovan Mitchell: I had Mitchell in the 2 spot before I talked myself into Doncic as such a safe bet to be an offensive juggernaut that I had to flip them. Mitchell is the smallest player of this bunch fairly comfortably. He's also easily the most athletic, and has by far the most accomplished of the group as the focal point of an offense participating and experiencing success at the postseason level of play. And that was as the only real threat on what was a pedestrian Utah offense. But the reinforcements that arrived this offseasons and their fit I think are perfect to both complement and unleash his full potential. The additional spacing and threat of significantly improved ball handling, playmaking, and shot creating around Mitchell should both lighten his overburdened load and give him much more space and less attention him to tear apart defenses. And like Booker, he should very freed UK to concentrate more energy on defense, where his athleticism and size can create havoc and potentially envelop and smother his matchup. I'm a big fan of quin snyder, and Conley and Bojdanovic both seem suited to assimilate seamlessly into the Jazz culture and identity, and the upgrade skillwise and as it relates to fit/spacing around Mitchell and Gobert raise both the ceiling and floor for a team that was really good last year and improved as much as any contending team that didn't transform into a contender by virtue of a new dynamic duo this offseason.

2. Luka Doncic: If it shakes out where Doncic is the obvious alpha of this group in their respective primes, I'll be both completely unsurprised and still understand my thought processes that lead to the egg on my face. I think he's an incredible offensive force, and an emergence as both the table setter and go-to scorer for a perennial top 3 offense is an outcome on the table. But if he's a top 20 offensive player instead of top 5, I cant see him giving anywhere near enough value on the defensive end to secure the top spot. Plus I'm not enamored with Porzjngis as their other foundational piece. But I love everything about Doncic's game. He game has a lot of shades of a larger, more polished as opposed to chaotic Manu Ginobili, who I think has very few outcomes where he's not a 10+ yr all NBA suitor

1. Jayson Tatum: I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge my bias as a green in my veins Celtics fan right off the bat. I decided Tatum was the franchise sometime in the first 10 games in his rookie season. I am mesmerized by how smooth and instinctual and ruthlessly surgically efficient his game and footwork and shot creation are and were from the moment he arrived in the NBA. His shot selection, body, and place in the offensive hierarchy have kept him bottled up to a degree this far, but I think they hand the keys to the young core after this offseason, and he's the centerpiece. I think that empowerment, and a dedication to attacking the rim much more aggressively will unmask and unleash the unstoppable scoring potential he has. His defense definitely needs some refinement, and the whole team suffered from a tendency to pout and give hot and cold intensity defensively, which snowballed over the course of the season as a reflection of the de facto team leader kyrie's inconsistency and inattention, exacerbated by the chemistry misfits and frustration and disappointment of the team's inability to ever really get. Regardless, all of last years bad habits need to be dropped, and with all the elite defenders, especially on the perimeter around him, awareness and effort and being a good team defender should be sufficient for the C's to continue to be an elite defensive team. As he fills out his NBA body and matures into his prime his game seems primed to grow on both ends right along with it. And I think that prime is the best bet to be the best 2 way wing in the league, and therefore the ideal building block for a championship team.

**Only Players Who Were Selected In the Lotto Era are Eligible**




* So only players selected from 1985 on are eligible for this exercise. The reasoning behind this is twofold:






**Only 16 teams will be created, 1 team for each lotto pick and 2 additional teams representing picks 15-30 and the second round**







**Positions and Peak is Taken into Account**



* Each player is assumed to be at their absolute peak of their powers

For each team I'll go into the starting 5  and then show the entire team as well as the cumulative All-Star selections, All-NBA selections, MVPs, ROYs etc.. between the members of each team. At the end of the series I'll start a tournament where we can decide which team is the best. If anyone has any suggestions on how seeding should work (should it go to a vote) or any suggestions to improve this thought experiment let me know (that is if anyone even gives a shit)

As expected this team has a ton of accolades, cumulatively this team has:


* **55 All Star Selections**

* **33 All-NBA Selections**

* **5 All-Defense Selections**

* **2 ROY winners**

* **1 6MOY** 

* **1 MVP**

* **3 HOFer**


This team is going to be a lot of fun and is going to score a ton of points. There's so many different lineup permutations possible with this team you can go jumbo with Penny, Hill, Melo, Pau, Embiid or go small with Billups, Harden, Beal, Penny, (pick a big). This team has lots of shooting, lots of ball handlers, and 3 bigs who are more than capable of passing and shooting, actually everyone on this roster can pass and shot and score. This may be the most complete team yet.





A couple thoughts on my thinking when constructing the roster:



* I went with Penny and Grant in the starting lineup over Billups and Melo, but I keep going back and forth over it. Penny had a much higher peak than Billups, but was a worse shooter and not as stout on defense. Penny's peak was just so high for me not to start him, and a backcourt of Harden and Penny would be really fascinating to watch.

  * Grant Hill over Melo was a bit easier for me. Obviously Melo is on another level as a scorer (although before injuries Grant Hill was much closer to Melo than it may seem), the difference in defense and shot creation for others convinced me that he would be a better fit next to Harden. Melo could also be in at the 4, which would create a pretty dynamic lineup, but prime Pau is such a talented player that I'm not too worried about slightly worse spacing.



* Not a ton of bigs on this team (and not a ton of great options to choose from Laettner, Favors, LaFrentz, Kanter, Okafor, etc..), but Embiid, Pau, and Horford are all so talented that I'm not too concerned about any lack of depth. 



* The bench is a bit guard heavy, but they're all pretty tremendous guards. I'm not sure how well Billups and D-Will could play together at the same time, but Davis and Beal can both thrive off ball. 

* Sean Elliot is a bit overshadowed on this team, but he's such a great uber role player. I would love to see him and Grant Hill play off of each other, it would be pretty awesome.

article in question: https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/7/23/20703286/nba-young-core-rankings\n\nThe rankings are based on a team’s players under age 25 – add up their 5-year projected wins above replacement (WAR) according to 538’s “CARMELO” projection to get a total young core value. I’ll admit I looked closely into this because I noticed the Knicks were ranked #20 (many lolknicks were had in the reddit comments).\n\nI intend to prove the methodology of this article is objectively trash even ignoring the limitations of CARMELO as beaten to death elsewhere (Klay Thompson = average starter?!), and ignoring other important factors like contract value and years of team control / Bird rights, which aren't accounted for at all. I won’t even address the questionable, sudden cut-off of 25 years. No, the main flaw is that the ranking penalizes teams for having young players with a negative WAR projection. As an illustrative example, take out Kevin Knox and Knicks jump up from #20 to about #14, ahead of the Bulls.\n\nThis might make sense in a vacuum (hey, these negative WAR players actively hurt the team!), but it fails to capture the true value of having a lot of young players, which is **a team will hold onto the young players who pan out and overperform their draft slot / projection and can get rid of those who get injured or underperform**.\n\nThe average 5y WAR projection of a rookie picked in the 2nd round is probably slightly negative [1]. All things equal, the rankings thus penalize a team with more 2nd round rookies. Yet a second round pick is unambiguously a positive asset in the real world – and occasionally teams hit big on their second rounders and get franchise cornerstones like Draymond, Manu or Jokic. Of course, most 2nd rounders are out of the league within 5 years, which is illustrative of my bolded point above – **the true value of a second round pick (*or any young player*) isn’t the 5-year projected WAR, it’s the chance of getting a diamond in the rough**. Every prospect is essentially a lottery ticket.\n\nThe same rationale applies to first round picks, too.  Even sophomores who had a terrible rookie season according to advanced metrics (say, Collin Sexton or Kevin Knox) would never be considered a negative asset in a trade package, yet they are in these rankings. De’Aaron Fox had a worse rookie season than Frank Ntilikina according to WAR, and Fox would have weighed down his team’s ranking more than Ntilikina if this article were written last year. But of course Fox had an unexpectedly (according to CARMELO) good season this year, so he's an absolutely huge positive for the Kings on an amazing deal. And the Kings can give him a team-friendly rookie extension or have match rights in RFA. On the other hand, the Knicks seem poised to part ways to Ntilikina if he doesn’t show anything this season.

During the regular season, each team plays 82 games. These regular season games are used to determine the seeding for the NBA playoffs. The league is divided in 2 conferences, based on the location of the teams: Western conference and Eastern conference. During the playoffs, teams battle within their conference to reach the apex of the season, the NBA finals. After one month and a half of intense playoffs games, the winners of each conference get a chance to claim the NBA championship during the finals. On the 13th of June, the Toronto Raptors from Canada became the NBA champions for the first time of their history by beating the Golden State Warriors 4-2. \n\nHowever, this format means that the two best teams of the season are not necessarily facing each other in the final. Not only that but this also means that each conference is not equal in terms of level of competition. One conference can gather more elite teams than the other. If that is the case, the teams from one conference will have a much tougher schedule over both the regular season and the playoffs.  Each team doesn’t face the other teams the same number of time. One team only faces a team from the other conference two times. \n\nTeam 1 from Conference A plays 30 times against teams from Conference B and 52 times against teams from Conference A. \n\nFor many years, people have been claiming that the West was, and still is, clearly better than the East. How true is this ? \nWith data gathered from Wikipedia / Basketball Reference using some web scraping tools and Python, I tried to answer these questions. For this study, I used data collected since the start of the 2010s decade. \n\n**Talent pool in each conference**\n\nAt the end of the day, the players are the ones who decide the outcome of matches. Superstar and all-star caliber players are definitely playing a huge part on a team success. Since the start of the decade, we have had nine MVP awards handed to seven different players. Five to Western conference players and four to Eastern conference players. On a first glance, it seems that the MVP award is balanced between both conferences. However, since 2010, the West has gathered on average 63.7% of the NBA MVP voting shares, while the East only gathered 36.3% (including 20% from LeBron only). During this decade, five players (arguably the top 5 players of this decade) are standing above the rest of the field: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook and James Harden. Four of them played for Western teams during this span.\n\nNow, while not necessarily meaningless in this study, MVP is an award given to only one player. Moreover, many factors like voters fatigue, narrative, injuries … can play into it – more than other awards. To have a better grasp on the spread of talent across each conference, All-NBA teams, All-Defensive teams and the DPOY award can be used. Regarding All-NBA teams, 91 selections out of 135 possible ones (67.41%) were handed to Western players. Only a little bit less than a third came from Eastern players. It gets worse when looking at the “quality” of these selections. Only five players from the East since the beginning of the decade have been selected in the 1st All-NBA team, totaling 13 selections between them: LeBron James (with 8th first team selection), Derrick Rose, Dwight Howard, Joakim Noah and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Whereas in the West, fourteen different players have been selected, totaling 32 first All-NBA team selections between them.  \n[*MORE INFO REGARDING ALL-NBA SELECTIONS CAN BE SEEN ON THIS INFOGRAPHIC*](https://imgur.com/E2fbs1K)\n\nFor the DPOY award, nine awards were given to seven different players. Three players won it while playing for an Eastern team, four players won it while playing for a Western team (Kawhi Leonard - San Antonio - and Rudy Gobert – Utah winning it two times). Once again, the voting shares are definitely leaning towards the West, which gathered on average each year about 62.78% of the voting shares. In the 2014-15 and 2016-17 season, the East totalized 2.33% and 1.11% respectively. It’s worth noting that at the beginning of the decade, the East had strong contenders for DPOY with players like Dwight Howard, Tyson Chandler, Joakim Noah and arguably LeBron James. While the West dominated the award for the last five years.\n \nRegarding All-Defensive teams, once more, the West has dominated the award since 2010.  52 selections out of 91 (57.14%) were awarded to Western players. The East produced 42.86% (or 39/91) of All-Defensive players. The 2012-13 team had six players in the 1st team, Chandler and Noah were tied. \n\n[*MORE INFO REGARDING ALL-NBA DEFENSE + DPOY CAN BE SEEN ON THIS INFOGRAPHIC*](https://imgur.com/0nZl1QP)\n\nRecent history has shown that being the All-Star is easier in the East. Using these awards and the eye test, it seems clear that the West has produced a lot more top players than the East in the last decade, whether it’s quantity wise or quality wise. Looking at top 10 players projected to play next season, we can see that only two of them will be playing in the East - Giannis Antetokounmpo from the Milwaukee Bucks and Joel Embiid from the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\n**Historical teams from each conference**\n\nEarlier in the decade, the East had two very dominant teams: \n\n \t- Chicago Bulls led by D.Rose and J.Noah\n\n \t- Miami Heat led by the Big 3 (L.James, D.Wade and C.Bosh)\n\nOther noticeable teams from the East were the LeBron-led Cleveland Cavaliers, the 14-15 Atlanta Hawks and last season’s Milwaukee Bucks and Toronto Raptors.\n\nHowever, most of the worst teams of the decade also played in the East. The Charlotte Bobcats during the lockout season were on a 9 regular season wins pace. They had the worst win rate % of the entire history of the NBA. In three seasons, between 2013 and 2016, the Philadelphia 76ers won 47 regular season games. We don’t know if “the Process” will grant them a championship, but it was definitely real at the time. They were definitely aiming to lose on purpose in order to get better draft picks. In 2015-16, they had the 3rd worst record of all-time in the regular season.\n\nIn the West, until the last two years, the Spurs were consistently in the top teams of the NBA. They won 509 regular season games in 722 matches. To put this into perspective, only 22 teams (listed in the table) had a better win rate in one season of play (58 wins pace). Even with this incredible consistency, they may not be the best team of the decade. Since Steve Kerr appointment, the Golden State Warriors are on a 64 wins pace. During these five years, they won two times 67 games in the regular season (7th best performance of all-time in the RS) and, obviously, had the best regular season of all-time with 73 wins. \nOther noticeable teams from the West were the Kobe Lakers, Dirk Mavs, Durant &amp; Westbrook-led Oklahoma City Thunder, the Lob City Clippers, the 12-13 Nuggets and Harden-led Rockets. \n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves were one of the worst franchises of the decade. The season following the departure of two-times All-NBA Kevin Love, they had the 30th worst regular season ever with 16 wins. The Phoenix Suns and Los Angeles Lakers both had very bad seasons \n\n[*GREATEST TEAMS OF THE DECADE*](https://imgur.com/04lJxNx)\n\n[*WORST TEAMS OF THE DECADE*](https://imgur.com/Iy3PaAs)\n\n**Western and Eastern conferences**\n\nWestern and eastern teams are only facing each other in the NBA finals or in the regular season. While regular season may not be fully representative of a single team, it cannot be considered meaningless. In fact, all championship teams of the decade had a very good win rate in the regular season (Yes! Even the Cavs from 2015-16). Since 2010, 57 wins (or a 69.51% win rate) were the least games won by a championship team during the regular season\n\nWe have seen some “historical” teams from each conference. Now, looking at both conference from top to bottom, the West looks better than the East. On average, since the beginning of the decade, teams from the West are winning more games than Eastern teams. Looking at the conferences’ results while facing the other conference, a trend is noticeable. During all decade, the East was never above the .500. The West always had a winning record over the East.\n\n[*WIN RATE % WEST vs EAST*](https://imgur.com/rpVe7U7)\n\nIn 2013-14, 63.11% of the games played between team from different conferences were won by Western teams. On average, across the decade, the West had a 56.72% win rate on the East. While the East had a win rate of 43.28%, meaning that the gap between both conferences is quite important. The West has 46,5 wins pace and the East has a 35,5 wins pace. Each team has 30 inter-conference games during the regular season. \n\nTo reach the playoffs, a Western team had to win more games than teams from the East. Looking at the 8th seed during each season since 2010, the average win rate to reach the playoffs in the West is 55.11% (good for a 45 wins record). In the East, the win rate required is 49.25% (good for a 40 wins record). During the 2013-14, the Phoenix Suns missed the playoffs while winning 48 games. In the East, the Atlanta Hawks clinched a playoff berth with 38 wins the same season. In 2017-18, the Denver Nuggets couldn’t reach the playoffs with 46 wins. It’s a legit argument for people wanting the playoffs to be played between the 16 best teams in the league record-wise – whether or not they are from the West or the East. \n\nNow looking only at playoffs teams, the assessment is even more striking. By selecting only inter-conference games between playoffs teams, the West had an average win rate of 57.85% on the East (47,5 wins pace) and the East had an average of 42.15% (34.5 wins pace). While some excellent teams probably skewed the win rate a little bit, the gap between the conferences is still there. \n\n[*WIN RATE % WEST vs EAST using playoffs teams*](https://imgur.com/MHwWxsX)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSince the start of the decade, the gap between both conferences has always been there. Looking at the players, it’s fair to say that the majority of the superstars played and are currently playing in the West. When looking at inter-conference match-ups, teams from the West have the upper hand on the East. Thus, the number of wins required to clinch the 8th seed is higher on the West. Moreover, western teams are playing each other more often. Thereby, the schedule for a western team is more difficult. \n\n***\n\n**Fun/forgotten facts**\n\n- Nuggets in 2011-12 had an impressive record vs eastern teams, boasting a 16-2 W-L record (while being undefeated against Eastern playoffs teams of that season). Against western teams, they had a sub 0.500 record, with 22 wins and 26 losses. However, it was during the lockout season, therefore it was on a smaller sample than “normal” seasons. \n\n- ""Enabling playoffs mode"": The Cleveland Cavaliers reached the finals four times in a row from 2015 to 2018. During that time, they were famously known for coasting during the regular season. They were never really dominant in the regular season, except for the 2015-16 season where they won 57 games and entered the playoffs as the 1st seed for the only time of the decade.\n\n- Perennial all-defensive guards Chris Paul and Tony Allen were selected in seven and six all-defensive teams respectively during the decade. However, neither was at any point since 2010 in the top 3 for DPOY. In fact, no guard won the award since Gary Payton in 1996.\n \n- ""Historical regular season eclipsed by the finalists”: The fact that the Golden State Warriors broke the record for most wins in the regular season during the 2015-16 season (with 73 wins) is well-known among NBA fans. The comeback from the Cleveland Cavaliers (down 1-3 in the finals – having to face elimination games three times in a row) is one of the most memorable moments of the NBA history. However, another team had a historical season. The San Antonio Spurs had the second best regular season of the decade during that season, tied 7th of all-time. They only lost once at home. In their 40th game at the AT&amp;T Center, they were beaten by the Warriors 92-86. Their home record during that season is tied for the best of all-time with the 1985-86 Celtics.  \n- “Entering a new big era ?”: This decade has been dominated by guards and wings. For many years, the top 3-5 players weren’t bigs. Now, looking at the current top players and their age, we might enter a new era dominated by bigs. Antetokounmpo, Jokic, Embiid and Davis (and to some extend Towns) are currently dominating and are still relatively young compared to the other superstars. Injuries and age are slowly catching on the superstars drafted in the last decade. \n- Within the decade, many teams faced a reversal of fortune. At the beginning of the decade, the Mavericks and the Lakers were among the top teams of the NBA. However, with the decline of their respective MVP, Dirk and Kobe, they reached the bottom of the league several times during the decade. The Grizzlies and, to some extend, the Hawks faced the same fate. The two best eastern teams from last season, the Raptors and the Bucks, were at some point among the worst teams in the league (2011 Raptors and 2014 Bucks). Each team listed above had at least one season in the top 30 regular season and at least one season in the top 30 for worst regular season record.\n\n***\nAll pictures are available in this album : [HERE](https://imgur.com/a/kDsp1BB)\n***\nThanks for reading this.

The Phoenix Suns and Los Angeles Lakers both had very bad seasons &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/04lJxNx""&gt;&lt;em&gt;GREATEST TEAMS OF THE DECADE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/Iy3PaAs""&gt;&lt;em&gt;WORST TEAMS OF THE DECADE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Western and Eastern conferences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Western and eastern teams are only facing each other in the NBA finals or in the regular season. While regular season may not be fully representative of a single team, it cannot be considered meaningless. In fact, all championship teams of the decade had a very good win rate in the regular season (Yes! Even the Cavs from 2015-16). Since 2010, 57 wins (or a 69.51% win rate) were the least games won by a championship team during the regular season&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have seen some “historical” teams from each conference. Now, looking at both conference from top to bottom, the West looks better than the East. On average, since the beginning of the decade, teams from the West are winning more games than Eastern teams. Looking at the conferences’ results while facing the other conference, a trend is noticeable. During all decade, the East was never above the .500. The West always had a winning record over the East.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/rpVe7U7""&gt;&lt;em&gt;WIN RATE % WEST vs EAST&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2013-14, 63.11% of the games played between team from different conferences were won by Western teams. On average, across the decade, the West had a 56.72% win rate on the East. While the East had a win rate of 43.28%, meaning that the gap between both conferences is quite important. The West has 46,5 wins pace and the East has a 35,5 wins pace. Each team has 30 inter-conference games during the regular season. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To reach the playoffs, a Western team had to win more games than teams from the East. Looking at the 8th seed during each season since 2010, the average win rate to reach the playoffs in the West is 55.11% (good for a 45 wins record). In the East, the win rate required is 49.25% (good for a 40 wins record). During the 2013-14, the Phoenix Suns missed the playoffs while winning 48 games. In the East, the Atlanta Hawks clinched a playoff berth with 38 wins the same season. In 2017-18, the Denver Nuggets couldn’t reach the playoffs with 46 wins. It’s a legit argument for people wanting the playoffs to be played between the 16 best teams in the league record-wise – whether or not they are from the West or the East. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now looking only at playoffs teams, the assessment is even more striking. By selecting only inter-conference games between playoffs teams, the West had an average win rate of 57.85% on the East (47,5 wins pace) and the East had an average of 42.15% (34.5 wins pace). While some excellent teams probably skewed the win rate a little bit, the gap between the conferences is still there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/MHwWxsX""&gt;&lt;em&gt;WIN RATE % WEST vs EAST using playoffs teams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the decade, the gap between both conferences has always been there. Looking at the players, it’s fair to say that the majority of the superstars played and are currently playing in the West. When looking at inter-conference match-ups, teams from the West have the upper hand on the East. Thus, the number of wins required to clinch the 8th seed is higher on the West. Moreover, western teams are playing each other more often. Thereby, the schedule for a western team is more difficult. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fun/forgotten facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuggets in 2011-12 had an impressive record vs eastern teams, boasting a 16-2 W-L record (while being undefeated against Eastern playoffs teams of that season). Against western teams, they had a sub 0.500 record, with 22 wins and 26 losses. However, it was during the lockout season, therefore it was on a smaller sample than “normal” seasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Enabling playoffs mode&amp;quot;: The Cleveland Cavaliers reached the finals four times in a row from 2015 to 2018. During that time, they were famously known for coasting during the regular season. They were never really dominant in the regular season, except for the 2015-16 season where they won 57 games and entered the playoffs as the 1st seed for the only time of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perennial all-defensive guards Chris Paul and Tony Allen were selected in seven and six all-defensive teams respectively during the decade. However, neither was at any point since 2010 in the top 3 for DPOY. In fact, no guard won the award since Gary Payton in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Historical regular season eclipsed by the finalists”: The fact that the Golden State Warriors broke the record for most wins in the regular season during the 2015-16 season (with 73 wins) is well-known among NBA fans. The comeback from the Cleveland Cavaliers (down 1-3 in the finals – having to face elimination games three times in a row) is one of the most memorable moments of the NBA history. However, another team had a historical season. The San Antonio Spurs had the second best regular season of the decade during that season, tied 7th of all-time. They only lost once at home. In their 40th game at the AT&amp;amp;T Center, they were beaten by the Warriors 92-86. Their home record during that season is tied for the best of all-time with the 1985-86 Celtics.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Entering a new big era ?”: This decade has been dominated by guards and wings. For many years, the top 3-5 players weren’t bigs. Now, looking at the current top players and their age, we might enter a new era dominated by bigs. Antetokounmpo, Jokic, Embiid and Davis (and to some extend Towns) are currently dominating and are still relatively young compared to the other superstars. Injuries and age are slowly catching on the superstars drafted in the last decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the decade, many teams faced a reversal of fortune. At the beginning of the decade, the Mavericks and the Lakers were among the top teams of the NBA. However, with the decline of their respective MVP, Dirk and Kobe, they reached the bottom of the league several times during the decade. The Grizzlies and, to some extend, the Hawks faced the same fate. The two best eastern teams from last season, the Raptors and the Bucks, were at some point among the worst teams in the league (2011 Raptors and 2014 Bucks). Each team listed above had at least one season in the top 30 regular season and at least one season in the top 30 for worst regular season record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All pictures are available in this album : &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/kDsp1BB""&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading this.

And considering who PG/Kawhi were teamed up with last year, it does make sense: Beverley is a ferocious defender and an excellent shooter, but not up to Lowry or Westbrook in the floor general department. And while PG13 didn't have an elite passer in Indiana and still experienced regular and post season success, that was in a much weaker conference.

Then again, both PG and Kawhi are excellent Iso players who will generate a good bit of gravity, and while it may make sense to double or trap them (seeing as they run a good bit of PnR too), that gravity combined with the Clippers' shooters like Pat Bev, Lou and Shamet will lead to many advantageous situations where the defense will be left to pick its poison. So to some degree, having two complete threats on offense who are, at the very least, not black holes on offense, will probably reduce the importance of a CP3 type disher a bit.

It seems crystal clear to me that Kawhi wanted to play with another star (KD, Kyrie, PG, or maybe Jimmy) preferably on a non Laker team. He wanted teams not to discuss meetings so that he could operate behind the scenes to try and link up with another superstar. 
I mean are we really supposed to believe that Magic saying he met with Kawhi is why the Lakers didn't get him? MAGIC DOESN'T EVEN WORK FOR THE TEAM!!! 
Seems like he met with Magic, but what could they really have talked about? Magic has already spilled his guts to the media about their front office.

""His scoring is just special,"" an executive said, when asked to explain why Harden was his choice. ""His ability to elevate a team with his offense as a passer and scorer is as good as it gets. To rely on him to carry an offense every night and stay healthy, he'd be my No. 1 guy.""

I’m not against their decision but I think this has opened up a new opportunity for USA Basketball. 

In years past we have been in constant awe of the firepower Team USA can produce. 130/140 point games are the norm for them. What if they decided to focus less on offense and simply tried to field a team of defensive specialists?

In my mind this has at least two benefits:

1. Players who normally wouldn’t ever get a chance at something like this will be put on the big stage. Guys who grind year in and out and are usually referred to as “hustle” guys can shine. These are guys who motivate themselves and tend to work well on any team they are placed on. A broad spectrum of NBA fans will tune in because these players tend to be fan favorites. Also could invite some younger players who fit this mold. 

2. Team USA could get a new look. Sometimes when I watched Team USA it felt like the All-Star game. All dunks and 3’s, the offense is just staggering. They usually play some ok defense but it’s clear that they don’t take the games very seriously every time. Hopefully by filling the team with hustle/defensive players we can get consistent effort the whole game. Overwhelming defense isn’t something we’ve truly seen from our guys. 

Some suggestions off the top of my head could be:

PJ Tucker

Pat Beverly

Lonzo Ball

Mikal Bridges

Jaren Jackson Jr.

Robert Covington

Dejounte Murray

Mo Bamba

I’m sure there are plenty of other examples you guys can think of that would be great additions to a team like this. 

I think a team filled with these guys would be really fun to watch. Obviously some of the best defensive guys have already pulled themselves from consideration but we could still get and incredibly talented defensive team on the floor.

Note: The above chart includes only players who got 10 or more votes.

Some notes on the data:

* Wow, three Cs and two SGs in this batch of five.
* Jusuf Nurkic finds his place in 43rd after a great season that was unfortunately ended due to catastrophic injury.
* Nurkic, Gasol and Williams all become the third member of their teams to enter the top 50. This means that the Raptors, Blazers and Clippers tie the Jazz for second in most top 50 players.

Alright; time to move to the final five (for real this time)! Please vote in the following form in the final poll of this season of the reddit NBA rankings: https://forms.gle/GZkpLU1Jh5LJ6JLZ8.

I'll report back with the results at around the same time tomorrow and finally conclude this crazy thing we've got.

I picture it working like this: If a team isn't going anywhere, and has a star player or even a role player that has tremendous value, they could could trade the rights of that player by the trade deadline to a contending team for either money or picks. And, at the same time the original team retains the players rights after the season concludes. So the NBA gets its stars in the playoffs and superstars aren't necessarily stuck on a bad team with no chance to win. 


For instance: if the Lakers aren't going anywhere next season and the Sixers need the missing piece, they could work out a deal with the Lakers on a price for Lebron for the rest of the season. Now Lebron is on a contending team in the playoffs, the NBA is happy, the Sixers are happy and the Lakers have a bundle of money to invest in other places.

Oscar's college days through to his playing days.

I found that he was actually often thought of as the GOAT even *BEFORE* his time with the Royals.  I also found that in discussions over GOAT, college players were listed with pros.  It makes sense given the context of the era, wherein college ball was more popular and respected than pro ball.  But after the 1960s (due in part to guys like Wilt, Oscar, West, Russell, Pettit, etc.) I found that sort of thinking shifted as far as talent goes.  Even today you will get people admiring college ball more for the fact they ""play the game for the love it!""

Anyways, here are some snippets I found after looking over a ton of articles.  I do in fact have local Ohio/Pennsylvania papers so that may include bias, however I looked around and found those publications cite people outside of their reporters or some using national syndicated columns so I figured that was fine.  


[The Daily Register (NJ) 24 Dec 1963](https://img.newspapers.com/img/img?institutionId=0&amp;user=6950247&amp;id=516942647&amp;width=557&amp;height=523&amp;crop=171_2479_1129_1081&amp;rotation=0&amp;brightness=0&amp;contrast=0&amp;invert=0&amp;ts=1563980529&amp;h=7e21983fd86051ac1879e6201e8422c2)

I really like this article as it uses a sort of Frankenstein theory in crafting the greatest basketball player possible at the time.  It is a response piece to another writer who called Cousy the GOAT but this guy doesn't agree.  He explains how Cousy's game was too one-dimensional.  He was possibly the best ball-handler and passer of all time but he wasn't a great shooter and wasn't great on defense or much of a rebounder.  The writer goes on to list some other players as the greatest in their respective areas such as rebounding, shooting, defense, etc.  He then suggests that even other players would agree the player who was great at all aspects is Oscar.  Then also suggesting that the 3-year NBA pro MIGHT be the greatest basketball of all time due to this overall mastery of the game.

In this selection from The Boston Globe, the writer is incorrigible to the selection of the Top 10 GOAT list done by Basketball Weekly back in 1968.  On that list, Oscar Robertson is at #1.  But the writer isn't so much as pissed at that as he is at them putting Wilt over Russell.  Probably some  bias there, but it is interesting how he isn't clamoring for Russell to be #1 but seems almost not as concerned with Oscar just jabbing him for having led a team that didn't make the playoffs but it's almost like he accepts Oscar at #1 and would rather dive into why Russell should be over Wilt.

This is a great one.  Those smug ""experts"" in New York have *finally* come around on Oscar Robertson. I also love the fact this sort of thinking hasn't changed in 60 years.  In any case, the New York media market came to the realization that Oscar is a GOAT candidate. Finally.


[The Cincinnati Enquirer 28 Dec 1962](https://img.newspapers.com/img/img?institutionId=0&amp;user=6950247&amp;id=104364251&amp;width=557&amp;height=576&amp;crop=0_4199_1089_1147&amp;rotation=0&amp;brightness=0&amp;contrast=0&amp;invert=0&amp;ts=1563979660&amp;h=b6f0885e447f23c99d158cce06ff2058)

It's an Enquirer publication, yes, but the sources on the GOAT claim are not the reporter.  In this segment the conversation is actually between Baylor and Oscar as far as GOAT goes.  Tommy Hawkins, who was a teammate of both, picks Oscar over Baylor.  As does the Detroit Pistons coach, Dick McGuire, who predicts the future in some sort of way by saying ""LA could win without Baylor, Cincinnati would finish last.""  Well...when LA ended up finally winning in the Jerry West era 10 years later, it was in fact without Baylor in 1972.

This was a segment from a ""Letter to the Editor"" section.  A local guy here comments on Jerry Lucas and his talented display in high school, saying he wishes he could see his team up against the one Oscar was apart of at Crispus Attucks which reigned over Indiana in the mid 50s.  In it, the man makes note the Editor compared Lucas to who may be the Greatest of All Time in Oscar.  This was 1958. Two years before he turned Pro.  It could mean as far as high school goes but that is never specified.  Could also mean just GOAT.

""Incomparable"", ""brightest stars in the heavens"", some terms used in this segment about Oscar's undefeated state championship run in 1956, the first in Indiana history.  The writer calling his title game the greatest one-man show of all time.



[The La Crosse Tribune (WI) 02 Feb 1960](https://img.newspapers.com/img/img?institutionId=0&amp;user=6950247&amp;id=512187990&amp;width=557&amp;height=915&amp;crop=2285_3576_567_949&amp;rotation=0&amp;brightness=0&amp;contrast=0&amp;invert=0&amp;ts=1563979421&amp;h=edb491ce6500dc723fd602dc9b4cda1b)

This article was an AP article so it was nationally circulated, it just happened I saw it in this publication, but the selection is a quote at the top from the Drake Bulldogs head coach in the wake of Oscar Robertson becoming the greatest scorer in NCAA history at the time. The second GOAT claim is from Cincy's own head coach. Probably biased, but the Drake coach is speaking like it's just a fact and that's from an outside school.



[Beckley Post-Herald (WV) 12 Mar 1963](https://img.newspapers.com/img/img?institutionId=0&amp;user=6950247&amp;id=15826023&amp;width=557&amp;height=543&amp;crop=1792_1328_1100_1093&amp;rotation=0&amp;brightness=0&amp;contrast=0&amp;invert=0&amp;ts=1563980035&amp;h=f66a48cc0914b0905f5339b030f482d5)

Even back in 1963, reporters got their hate mail from angry fans on their hot takes.  Now it's just easier but they have more typos.  The hot take in this segment is that a Sports Illustrated writer put Jerry West as the finest backcourt player in the league along with Bob Cousy.  Omitting Oscar completely.  Well the fans didn't like that.  Elliot Silverstein of DeWitt, N. Y., ""Taking nothing away from Jerry West, he's hardly the best defensive back- court man in the league. Rebounding- isn't all there is to defense, and West isn't the best rebounder anyway. ""Oscar Robertson has over 300 more, but Mr. Legget (author of the original SI story) probably doesn't even know who Robertson is. . . .""  I absolutely love this refute because to this day you see this argument in threads on this subreddit every single day.  ""YOU DON'T EVEN WATCH HIM YOU PROBABLY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO HE IS!""  Another write-in does call West the most *clutch* player of all time though, but still voting for Oscar overall.

This segment is from a paper in Massachusetts responding to a national writer's column.  This column is referenced nationally by many other publications in the country, I just happened to see this North Adams one first.  It is a list of the GOAT basketball players but split into 2 teams because the first group played in such a different time compared to 1964 where the game is just far too different to compare.  Sound familiar?  Oscar Robertson is listed along with the other greats of the era.  Not a GOAT claim, but he is in there along as the GOATs of his era.  We all knew that, but it was an interesting segment nonetheless.




In my research I did find the Wilt GOAT claims as well, but to tell you the truth it wasn't as popular a claim nationwide as it was in the publications I found which were more so in the Philly area.  There were also some Russell claims too and this was seemingly more because of the fact his team was winning the championship every year, whereas the articles I found about Oscar were hyping him up as an individual.  In all I probably looked through around 50-70 publications and narrowed it down to probably 25 and used the ones I provided above.  If I sought out only Wilt articles I'm sure I could put something together but like I said it didn't appear to be as prevalent nationally.  And today I barely ever see Oscar Robertson in Top 10 lists.  I think he usually is put into the Top 15, and I think it has to do with him never winning while in his prime.

To cut into this bit of lull in the NBA calendar I decided to go through each draft since 1985 and create the best possible team for each pick. /r/nfl ran a series (by u/JaguarGator9) like this that was really interesting and a lot of fun so I figured I could ~~shamelessly rip it off~~ create my own version for the NBA. Yesterday I posted the # 1 selections team and today I'm posting the # 2 team. Before I get into the roster construction I just wanted to reiterate a couple points from yesterday.




****

**Only Players Who Were Selected In the Lotto Era are Eligible**




So only players selected from 1985 on are eligible for this exercise. The reasoning behind this is twofold:




* First and foremost if I didn't limit it the #1 pick would just demolish every other team and this wouldn't be fun. If you look at the [list](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/draft_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;year_min=&amp;year_max=&amp;round_min=&amp;round_max=&amp;pick_overall_min=1&amp;pick_overall_max=1&amp;franch_id=&amp;college_id=0&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;is_active=&amp;is_hof=&amp;c1stat=&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=&amp;c2stat=&amp;c2comp=gt&amp;c2val=&amp;c3stat=&amp;c3comp=gt&amp;c3val=&amp;c4stat=&amp;c4comp=gt&amp;c4val=&amp;order_by=ws) from basketball reference you'll quickly realize that you could make two teams from this list that would still crush every other team. 




* Given that the NBA draft has changed so dramatically this ensures that we're still comparing apples to apples with each draft. Even forgetting the addition of the lotto comparing a draft from the 60's with territorial picks, 8 teams, and like 15 rounds doesn't work with a draft from 2009 with 30 teams and two rounds





**Only 16 teams will be created, 1 team for each lotto pick and 2 additional teams representing picks 15-30 and the second round**





* The first iteration of this I did each of the 30 teams in the first round and a second round team and undrafted team before realizing that any pick after 14 is going to produce a shit team (and honestly there are some picks in the lotto after like 6 that have some really bad teams). By combining the non-lotto first round and the second round I was able to add some parity into the tournament





**Positions and Peak is Taken into Account**

* I tried to select balanced starting 5s and balanced teams of 12 or otherwise some picks would have nothing but guards or big men on the team.

* Players are chosen by a combination of their total career and their respective peaks. So some players who had their careers cut by injury, but had super high peaks will make it over players who had long and steady careers

* Each player is assumed to be at their absolute peak of their powers

********



For each team I'll go into the starting 5  and then show the entire team as well as the cumulative All-Star selections, All-NBA selections, MVPs, ROYs etc.. between the members of each team. At the end of the series I'll start a tournament where we can decide which team is the best. If anyone has any suggestions on how seeding should work (should it go to a vote) or any suggestions to improve this thought experiment let me know (that is if anyone even gives a shit)

With all that said here is the #2 overall pick team:

Unlike the #1 selection team this team has much more balance and isn't just essentially 8 bigs, LeBron, and 3 guards. 


While they don't have quite the hardware as the #1 selection team, there is still some serious star power on this team, especially on defense:

* **50 All Star Selections**

* **33 All-NBA Selections**

* **28 All-Defense Selections**

* **2 ROY winners**

* **5 DPOY wins** 

* **1 MVP**

* **3 HOFers**


The one thing I can say about this team is that opposing guards are going to have a really bad time when they have to face up against Kidd and Payton. With 18 All Defense selections between just the two of them, and with their size, this backcourt is going to shut down most teams. While both Payton and Kidd weren't great shooters (although the later version of Kidd learned how to hit open shots) they're not awful and at least have to be respected. 


* Aldridge and Zo make a pretty interesting pairing in the frontcourt. Aldridge will finally have a top line defensive center to ease his burden on D and with Zo liking to create his offense in the post this gives Aldridge the space he needs to operate for his favorite mid-range shots. 

* With all that said this team belongs to Durant. He is the unquestioned best offensive player and will be the focal point on offense. Aldridge is a great second banana to Durant and with the rest of the lineup focused on defense this frees Durant to really focus his energy and attention on getting buckets. 



A couple thoughts on my thinking when constructing the roster:



* Wings are hard to come by with early picks, but having Kevin Durant helps with a lot of those problems. I went with Keith Van Horn and Marvin Williams as my bench wings over other choices like Brandon Ingram, Jabari Parker, Stromile Swift, Michael Beasley, Danny Ferry etc. because they both can at least play a little D and are great as spot up shooters and should be a perfect pairing with Jason Kidd. Ingram is probably the biggest omission for wing players and he is better than Marvin Williams, but Williams can make 3s more consistently and can guard both the 3 and the 4 respectably which gave him the edge



* This team might be able to hang with the #1 selections team inside with a stellar defense combo of Zo, Camby, and Chandler, but I'm not sure how much they can slow down the combo of Shaq, Duncan, Robinson, Ewing. This team will have great rim protection though and when paired with the suffocating defense by Kidd and the Glove this team will be a monster on defense. 



* Backup guard selections were really difficult and I see the logic of people selecting Bibby or D-Lo over Steve Francis and Kenny Anderson. D-Lo vs Francis is essentially a toss up, each of their best seasons are very similar. I ultimately went with Francis as he was a much better rebounder (5.6 career average and a peak of 7 rpg in 2002) and is friskier on defense. For Bibby vs Anderson it just came down to personal preference. Bibby is a better shooter, but I think Kenny Anderson was a better playmaker, but I could see people going either way.

It got me thinking about what would help improve how business is conducted in the NBA.

Personally, I think it is pretty clear that the players don't see the extra guaranteed year and bigger salary an incumbent team can offer as a very big incentive to stay with their team any more, which leads to more under the table recruiting going on during the season. Widening the gap between what incumbent teams can offer a free agent and what other teams can offer would be incentive for players to stay with a team, and help small market teams retain their stars. Additionally, if a player leading up to free agency is traded to another team with more than a season left on his contract, the team that receives said player should not be able to make an offer greater than any other teams. That would deincentivize players from forcing their way off a team with trade requests and lots of ""DNP - General Soreness"".

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I believe they should just move the official start date of free agency to be immediately after the finals. Even if signings can't become official until late June/early July, once the league is done calculating revenue from their fiscal year, and they can officially set the cap. Players and teams are already doing under the table negotiations during this time period as it is. Why not have the official start date more accurately reflect the reality of what is actually happening?

If you don't care about all this business, the final stat lines are near the bottom. 

The question we are looking to answer is: if we adjusted Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and LeBron James' stats to where they are all playing on common ground (pace of game, team shot distribution, etc.), whose stats would be the best of the three?

We took each of the 3 players' best 5 seasons by total win shares, and averaged each player's stats across those 5 years. We then took data from every team that played in each of those seasons, and averaged up the 15 seasons to get a sort of common playing ground. We then used that data to answer questions such as this: if Michael Jordan took ""x"" percent of his team's three pointers, how many threes would he take if his team were taking as many threes as the 15 season average? By using that same method for each of the following sections, we can get a somewhat better idea of how each player's stats would look on common ground. 

We would predict that their final stats would be somewhere between their actual per-game stats, and their idealized per-100 possessions stats. Consider the final stat lines as ""per adjusted 100 possessions"" which as we will find out will come closer to \~93 possessions. It's just more complicated than taking per 100 and multiplying by 0.93.

|Kobe|11.680|10.208|8.645|
|LeBron|11.680|10.208|7.739|

Adjusted FTA was calculated by multiplying free throw rate per 100 possessions by the average number of team possessions: 93.487. Points via free throws then multiplied that number by the player's free throw percentage over their best 5 years.

&amp;#x200B;

**Points Via 2-Point Field Goals**

|Kobe|23.660|22.985|22.247|
|LeBron|20.840|20.972|23.621|

Adjusted 2-Point FGA was calculated by taking the difference between team 2-PT FGA over the 15 year average, and team 2-PT FGA over each player's best 5 seasons. That percentage difference then decreased or increased their number of player attempts to meet the average. That number was then multiplied by that given player's 2-PT FG percentage over their best 5 seasons to give number of points.

&amp;#x200B;

**Points Via 3-Point Field Goals**

|Kobe|5.680|4.806|5.035|
|LeBron|5.980|4.151|4.421|

Adjusted 3-Point FGA was calculated by taking the difference between team 3-PT FGA over the 15 year average, and team 3-PT FGA over each player's best 5 seasons. That percentage difference then decreased or increased their number of player attempts to meet the average. That number was then multiplied by that given player's 3-PT FG percentage over their best 5 seasons to give number of points.

|LeBron|3.58%|1.594|18.86%|8.396|

Adjusted rebounds were calculated by multiplying each player's ORB/DRB percentage by the available number of possible rebounds, as taken from the 15 season average.

&amp;#x200B;

**Steals &amp; Blocks**

|Player|STL%|BLK%|Adjusted Steals|Adjusted Blocks|

**Final Stat Lines**

Michael Jordan: **36.3 points**, 8.8 rebounds, 6.6 assists, **3.5 turnovers**, **3.3 steals**, 0.5 blocks

Kobe Bryant: 35.9 points, 7.5 rebounds, 6.1 assists, 3.8 turnovers, 2.1 steals, 0.3 blocks

LeBron James: 35.8 points, **10.0 rebounds**, **8.6 assists**, 4.2 turnovers, 2.1 steals, **0.6 blocks**

&amp;#x200B;

**Possible Flaws In Calculation**

Obviously not a perfect system. It's easy to wonder that had Jordan played in the ""three point era"", he would have taken a greater percentage of his team's three point shots. Equally, taking Kobe or LeBron back to what is generally considered a more physical era of basketball may have affected their stats in either direction.

Defense is no concern.

Here is what I came up with:

Steph Curry/Michael Jordan/Kevin Durant/Larry Bird/Shaquille O'Neal

My thinking is that maybe you do without a primary distributor and instead rely on multiple people who are good at it. Lots of ball sharing. I can count on Steph, MJ, and Bird to do this. KD and Shaq are good for their positions and size.

I've got a three excellent three point shooters in Steph, KD, and Bird to provide spacing, and they really can score from anywhere. Jordan is the efficient midrange/layup bucket getter. Shaq is unstoppable down low.

Beyond them, the next most likely are a few more guys with obvious skills or traits that *probably* would allow them to acclimate, but I'm less certain: Tom Gola, Bill Sharman, and possibly Paul Arizin.

Then there's the curious case of Dolph Schayes. He was a mega-star in the 50's (*it was basically him, Mikan, Pettit, and Cousy at the top of the food chain before Russell*), and at 6-ft-8, 220 pounds he had the size to not get overwhelmed physically as a modern forward. He wasn't exactly fast/athletic, but not every forward today is. He was known for 2 key things: 1) his can't-stop-won't-stop relentlessness in all that he did (*most notably practicing &amp; rebounding - was a great rebounder*), and 2) his outside shot. As a big man who shot from distance regularly &amp; accurately, he's been compared to Larry Bird by historians who are kind to the early game. The problem is that when you watch [his highlights](https://youtu.be/EL2s7i86rog), you can see that he doesn't have a clean jumper by today's standards (*West and Pettit were fine on this front*). He would hit outside shots, often from well beyond 3-point range, at a good rate for the time, but if he showed up today he would have to take time to fix his shot. Even with a so-so FG%, there's no doubt he could shoot (*keeping in mind FG%'s were low due to clogged lanes and he took lots of long shots which automatically makes it worse*): he was REMARKABLE free throw shooter, leading the league in FT% 3x, and finishing top-3 in the league for 10 straight seasons. It's clear he spent time working on his shooting and excelled at it (*seriously, his gym rat stories are legendary*), but the mechanics of that 50's jumper wouldn't work today.

The other teams in that 3-6 tier are the Celtics, pacers and the nets with the sixers and bucks being a tier above. 


Their rotation next year looks like this:
Lowry/FVV
Powell/McCaw
OG/Stanley Johnson
Siakam/RHJ
Gasol/Ibaka

Looking at the rotation, the loss of Kawhi and Danny green will be felt more on offense than defense. Losing a 26 ppg scorer as well as an elite shooter in green will be tough to replace. The Raptors are banking that Siakam will improve and take over as the go to scorer. He showed flashes last season that he was capable but was inconsistent when teams focused on him. In the playoffs, Giannis and Embiid were very effective guarding him by sagging off him and waited for him to come into the paint. Fortunately, only a few teams deploy defenders of Giannis and Embiid's level. He should be fine with lesser defenders who don't have the size and speed to keep up with him. Players like OG and Powell will take a step forward offensively. They both will need to be more consistent from 3 while showing a greater ability to score off the catch. FVV will need to improve as a playmaker/decision making as he will be tasked will a larger offensive burden. At times last year, he struggled to run the second unit and the bench last season struggled compared to the year before. Also, Lowry and Gasol need remain effective and prevent a major drop in production. Overall, I think players will struggle a little in bigger roles and their offense fall off compared to last year. I think the lack of floor spacing will hurt their offense alot and as a result, the team will try to push in in transition as often as possible. Siakam is a strong transition player and with the athletes the Raptors have on the wings, I think this is probably their best strategy. 



 On the other hand, their defense still looks elite. I don't think any member of that rotation is a below average defender with alot of them being a good/great defender. Keeping guys like Gasol and Ibaka r huge for the defense because they r both good defenders that can protect the rim and can guard the pick and roll effectively. Gasol is also an excellent post defender. Having 48 minutes of good defense from your centers is very important when constructing a great defense. Moreover, having long athletic wings like Siakam, OG, Stanley Johnson,Powell, RHJ and McCaw will help cause turnovers with deflections and prevent potential mismatches. With all of those players being long and athletic, the Raptors will have the option to switch alot without having to worry about mismatches. Lastly, Lowry and FVV are both good defenders that are high basketball IQ players that play alot bigger than their size. Lowry is not the quickest guy anymore but he is very smart and strong. He can guard bigger players due to his strength and isn't afraid to take charges. FVV is great at chasing players through screens and plays with great effort.

Another point I wanted to add is that Nick Nurse this past year showed that he is a very good coach who wasn't afraid to try new/different things. The raptors during the playoffs changed their defensive schemes based on who they were playing and tried to find the right combination of players to execute the schemes. Against the sixers he played lineups with both Gasol and Ibaka on the court when they were getting killed on the glass while against the warriors he deployed a box and 1 defense to limit curry. He experimented with different lineups and wasn't afraid to wrong with certain adjustments.

Overall, I think the Raptors will have a top 5-6 defense in the league but their offense will be mediocre in that 15-20 range. This will lead them to roughly 45-50 wins and a 3-6 seed in the East.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,61637,public,self,Where do you think the Raptors will finish in the Eastern Conference next year?,0,1563997543,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cgxg0d/where_do_you_think_the_raptors_will_finish_in_the/,,,,,,,,,,

F5 season is slowing down, summer league is over, and r/nba is becoming a place were shitposts go to die. To cut into this bit of lull in the NBA calendar I decided to go through each draft since 1985 and create the best possible team for each pick. /r/nfl ran a series (by u/JaguarGator9) like this that was really interesting and a lot of fun so I figured I could ~~shamelessly rip it off~~ create my own version for the NBA. 





For those of you unfamiliar with the concept (here's the [link](https://np.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/bs8vqs/rnfl_alltime_draft_pick_tournament_introduction/?st=jw26hysx&amp;sh=9ca75aee)) I went through each draft in the lotto era (more on that in a second) and created the best possible team from those players selected for each pick. Over the next two weeks I'm going to go over the best all time drafted teams in the lotto era, which will conclude in a 16 team tournament to decide which draft position has produced the best possible team.





Given the differences between the NFL and NBA I tweaked what u/JaguarGator9
 did to better reflect the NBA draft. With that being said here is the format and criteria that I used when selecting teams:

****

**Only Players Who Were Selected In the Lotto Era are Eligible**




So only players selected from 1985 on are eligible for this exercise. The reasoning behind this is twofold:




* First and foremost if I didn't limit it the #1 pick would just demolish every other team and this wouldn't be fun. If you look at the [list](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/draft_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;year_min=&amp;year_max=&amp;round_min=&amp;round_max=&amp;pick_overall_min=1&amp;pick_overall_max=1&amp;franch_id=&amp;college_id=0&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;is_active=&amp;is_hof=&amp;c1stat=&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=&amp;c2stat=&amp;c2comp=gt&amp;c2val=&amp;c3stat=&amp;c3comp=gt&amp;c3val=&amp;c4stat=&amp;c4comp=gt&amp;c4val=&amp;order_by=ws) from basketball reference you'll quickly realize that you could make two teams from this list that would still crush every other team. 




* Given that the NBA draft has changed so dramatically this ensures that we're still comparing apples to apples with each draft. Even forgetting the addition of the lotto comparing a draft from the 60's with territorial picks, 8 teams, and like 15 rounds doesn't work with a draft from 2009 with 30 teams and two rounds





**Only 16 teams will be created, 1 team for each lotto pick and 2 additional teams representing picks 15-30 and the second round**





* The first iteration of this I did each of the 30 teams in the first round and a second round team and undrafted team before realizing that any pick after 14 is going to produce a shit team (and honestly there are some picks in the lotto after like 6 that have some really bad teams). By combining the non-lotto first round and the second round I was able to add some parity into the tournament





**Positions and Peak is Taken into Account**

* I tried to select balanced starting 5s and balanced teams of 12 or otherwise some picks would have nothing but guards or big men on the team.

* Players are chosen by a combination of their total career and their respective peaks. So some players who had their careers cut by injury, but had super high peaks will make it over players who had long and steady careers

* Each player is assumed to be at their absolute peak of their powers

********



For each team I'll go into the starting 5 to give some accolades/historical context and then show the entire team as well as the cumulative All-Star selections, All-NBA selections, MVPs, ROYs etc.. between the members of each team. At the end of the series I'll start a tournament where we can decide which team is the best. If anyone has any suggestions on how seeding should work (should it go to a vote) or any suggestions to improve this thought experiment let me know (that is if anyone even gives a shit)

With all that said here is the #1 overall pick team:

Derrick Rose | G | 2008 -  | 18.8| 3.5 | 5.6 | .8 | .3 | 37.2

****

This team is a juggernaut, here's a list of players I didn't select:

* KAT, Glenn Robinson, Larry Johnson, John Wall, Derrick Coleman, Joe Smith, Danny Manning, Kenyon Martin, Brady Daugherty, Andrew Bogut, Dwight Howard, Ben Simmons these guys would probably make every other team. 


This team is stacked, they are going to overpower other teams. They're essentially the Monstars. Combined this team has:

* **111 All Star Selections**

* **89 All-NBA Selections**

* **38 All-Defense Selections**

* **10 ROY winners**

* **1 DPOY winner** (which was really surprising to me that Duncan didn't get any)

* **10 MVPs**

* **5 HOFers**

This team is loaded, every player on the team is either averaging over 20 PPG for their career or just miss that mark because of injuries (Yao and Rose). This team is the prohibitive favorites and despite the flaws I expect them to dominate the competition. I mean how do you possibly guard this team with all the size, strength, and sheer athletic talent. Having to guard prime Shaq and prime LeBron at the same time seems like a Sisyphean task. 



With that being said the obvious weakness of this team is the lack of guards and shooting. There's a trend for #1 picks - Big, hyper athletic monsters who just overpower the competition. This made actually picking the team pretty challenging as you could pretty easily have a team with only 1 or maybe 2 guards on the team. Spacing will be an issue, but honestly with how physically dominant this team is scoring will not be an issue. 



A couple thoughts on my thinking when constructing the roster:



* LeBron, Duncan, and Shaq were no brainers, they are pantheon level NBA players and each of them would be the best player on any other team in this tournament. Finding two other players to fit around them was an issue, but having two guys who can handle the ball and create for themselves and these 3 was my biggest priority. 



* I was tempted of having Kryei be the only starting guard (just so there would be one reliable shooter) and having LeBron play the 2 and Blake the 3 (given his playmaking and new jumper), but I went with Iverson because of his ability to break down a defense and get to the line. Honestly could have gone either way. 



* KAT and Wall were two tough omissions for me. KAT's shooting would be really helpful for this team, but I just couldn't justify his young career yet over someone like Yao or Chris Webber. I picked Rose over Wall given Rose's better peak, even though as of right now Wall may have had a slightly better overall career.

Bird’s career averages: 24ppg, 10rpg, 6apg, 1.7 spg, 0.8 bpg on shooting splits of 50/37/88.

My homie thinks he would play at the same level if not better in todays game claiming that his shooting, passing, and overall game sense would translate well to the current meta making him the same kind of superstar as he was in the past. 

Whereas i disagree to that point, claiming the trope that players are more athletic nowadays and Bird’s abilities as a point forward could be contained. His volume of 3 point attempts per game was under 2 as well, so who knows if he could maintain 37% shooting with, say, 5 attempts per game. I argued he’d average somewhere around 15ppg/5rpg/6apg. I think he’d be a clear rotation player, but also a defensive liability.

Personally I think the Aminu contract was great value for a good wing but I don’t believe he was a great fit for them because he plays the same position as Gordon and Isaac and he doesn’t shoot the 3 ball well enough to play the 3 on a team that already has a below average 3 point shooter at the 2(Fournier 34%), and 4(Gordon 35%). For Vucevic who is their best player and a back to the basketball bigman who works primarily in the post.

Secondly they didn’t really give their young players a path to playing time. Bamba was drafted a year ago and will most likely have to sit behind Vucevic for another 4 years and Isaac has more competition at the PF position.

Assuming he is a shooting guard, where does Harden rank among the all-time greats? 

Looking at ESPN’s all-time shooting guard rankings from a few years ago (https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/nbarankSGs/ranking-top-10-shooting-guards-ever), the top 5 seem to be Jordan, Kobe, Wade, Clyde Drexler, and Allen Iverson. I excluded Jerry West because as far as I can tell, he spent a vast majority of his career as a point guard, so it doesn’t really make sense to call him a shooting guard in these rankings. 

I’m honestly not sure where Harden should be placed in terms of all-time rankings. I feel like he’s pretty clearly behind Jordan and Kobe, but could be placed somewhere in the top 3-5 depending on what you emphasize. In terms of individual achievements, he’s as accomplished as any of those guys in the that 3-5 range. He’s a seven time all star, six time all-nba selection, two time scoring champion, assist champion, 6MOTY, and an MVP. Just this past season, he scored at a rate that we haven’t seen since MJ and Kobe. 

Obviously, the negatives against Harden are in postseason success. Dwyane Wade is a three time NBA champion and even has a finals MVP. Drexler managed to win a title after joining Houston as well. Is this postseason success more important than all of the individual regular season success that Harden has had? 

I’m honestly not even a Harden fan. Dwyane Wade was my favorite player in the league when I was younger, so I would want to say he’s still ahead of Harden, but the amount of production this guy has had the past couple years is insane. He’s made more threes in the past two seasons than Wade made in his entire career.

As with all the other tournaments I'll be rooting for the Yugoslav countries but also for countries not named the USA. Hoping Giannis or Spain can maybe cause an upset and knock them out early.

If Yugoslavia still existed it would be a pretty formidable squad. Off the top of my head; with the likes of Doncic, Jokic, both Bogdans playing together, Dragic, Teodosic, Saric, Marjanovic all on the same team, I must be missing a few, help me out. 

Either way I just wanted to gauge what value most NBA fans have on the World Cup of Basketball and see, if the consensus is that it should or perhaps should not be held in higher esteem by all players from all countries in order to lift the games profile to rival that of football (soccer).

Perhaps FIBA should look at changing the rules during the Olympics and making it like football and only allow a few veterans and full the rest of the squad with youth players (21 or less).

I think he'll top out as a Blake Griffin kind of guy. This isn't a bad thing at all as BG is a great player and very under rated in my opinion. 

But outside of his athleticism, what other elite traits does he have?

He's undersized for his position and relies heavily on his athleticism and strength at the moment.

He doesn't really have any perimeter game. His handle is good for a PF, but he's more of a line drive slasher then someone who can break down the defense, shoot off the dribble, etc.

So what else do people see that i'm not about him that makes him look so great?

Run a lineup of LeBron-Brogdon-Kuzma-AD-McGee as your starting lineup.  Have Lamb and Cousins lead are fairly strong second unit.  The addition of a B+ / A- player like Brogdon would've been an amazing pickup for the team to give them a reliable 2-way player that can lead the floor if the Lakers are in a situation where LeBron or AD are resting / out of action for a night.  The value of having two players like Green / KCP is much less than having a player like Brogdon from my perspective.  Additionally with having a player like Lamb &gt; Bradley and Cook.  You can sign Javale and DMC for the same money, and still sign the minimum contract guys (Rondo, Dudley, Daniels, Caruso) for more depth.

I think I found the country that could push the US...unfortunately, it doesn't exist anymore. But, looking at the roster they could put together, it makes me wonder if we could reunite Yugoslavia, for basketball purposes.

Here is a selection of the NBA players who come from former Yugoslavian countries:

Nikola Jokic

Luka Doncic

Nikola Vucevic

Goran Dragic

Bojan Bogdanovic

Jusuf Nurkic

Dario Saric

Ivanca Zubac

Bogdan Bogdanovic

Boban Marjanovic

&amp;#x200B;

While the talent is a little big man heavy, the talent level seems to be there. A starting five of Jokic, Saric, Bogdanovic, Doncic and Dragic, with Vucevic as the 6th man, would be pretty devastating.

Note: The above chart includes only players who got 30 or more votes.

Some notes on the data:

* Chris Paul finally finds his place in this year's rankings at 37th. That's quite the drop from last year's 11th! Perhaps a reflection of his perceived regression, his massive contract, or his continuing injury woes, CP3 seems to have faded in the eyes of Reddit.
* Nikola Vucevic finally lands at 38th place! With his ranking, all All-Stars from the 2018-2019 season are ranked (with the exception of Oladipo and the two Legacy-Stars).
* Tobias Harris marks the 4th 76ers player to appear in the Top 50. The 76ers and Warriors are tied for most representation, with 4 each.

Today, we'll move on to vote for the top 41-45 players in the NBA. Follow this link to submit your vote: https://forms.gle/H46uq7bqPDZ81hzH7.

Once again, a reminder that this ranking is **reflective.** We are primarily basing these rankings off the 2018-2019 season and playoffs and how each player performed specifically during that time.

I'll report back with the results at around the same time tomorrow and move on to the final, *final* round.

Thank you for your continued participation!

With that, do you think this will always be the case? Will the World Cup always be considered just a stepping stone to the Olympics?

I can understand Harden and Davis withdrawing, but McCollum and Eric Gordon withdrawing? The latter two don't look like they're going to make the Olympic team. Or do they just not care about representing their country? Although don't get me wrong, Team USA is still stacked.

-Form a team you think would win a championship in the modern NBA with a starting 5 and 3 backup players.
-You can have a maximum of two all-star players on your team. Remember, they must have never made an All-NBA team
-Don't try to cheat the game by choosing a single season that a player wasn't an All-NBA player, but the rest of their career they were. The same idea applies to choosing a single season a player wasn't an all star to try to exceed the 2 all star limit


**Example Team:**
PG - Derek Harper (0x all star, 0x All-NBA)
SG - Shane Battier (0x all star, 0x All-NBA)
SF - Andrei Kirilenko (1x all star, 0x All-NBA)
PF - Rasheed Wallace (4x all star, 0x All-NBA)
C - Arvydas Sabonis (0x all star, 0x All-NBA)

Backup G - CJ McCollum (0x all star, 0x All-NBA)
Backup  F - Pascal Siakam (0x all star, 0x All-NBA)
Backup C - Lamar Odom (0x all star, 0x All-NBA)


My rationale behind this team: My whole starting lineup is filled with pretty stout and switchable defenders, especially my 1-4. There's plenty of shooting on the team. Derek Harper is the perfect role playing point guard: an all-defensive player, can knock down the 3 reliably, and can distribute the ball effectively. Shane Battier is the perfect 3 and D 2-guard. Kirilenko is my quarterback on defense and my do-it-all on offense. Rasheed Wallace can serve as my center when playing against more mobile teams, while bringing an edge and competitive fire to my team. Sabonis is important to my starting lineup to provide some low and high post playmaking. What the starting lineup lacks a little bit, however, is ballhandlers. So on my bench are 3 players who are perfectly comfortable with creating with the ball in their hands. My team can play small ball or bully ball depending on our matchup.



**To help out, here are some players you might want to choose from**

First step is to get rid of the salary cap and max contracts.  No contract restrictions should really be necessary.  Second step allows for a team that has signed a given player to lease said player out to another team.  The terms of the lease would play out as an investment for the bigger market team where the smaller market team gets the player and pays x% of the salary while the bigger team gets ""y"" in return.  
  
""Y"" can be any number of things named by the team leasing the player.  Maybe it's a deal where any increase in ticket sales has a percentage attached to it that gets paid to the team supplying the player.  Jersey sales would be another one.  Postseason revenue could also be in play.  Whatever can be tracked and connected to any individual player's impact would be a possibility to make these deals work.  
  
So, the benefit for the small market team is the chance to divert part of the payment for a player onto the back end of the deal after a given amount of success to have made the deal worthwhile.  You mitigate the risk up front at cost of the profits later for the chance at a title which would help build your team's brand.  The big markets get to use this opportunity to capitalize on an underpay who maybe wasn't a good fit or mitigate the costs and long-term financial attachment to an overpay.  Players benefit because of money, and fans benefit because of the hope for small-market competitiveness.

Note: The above chart includes only players who got 30 or more votes.

Some notes on the data:

* DeMar DeRozan, although dominantly 31st, has dropped massively in the rankings. From last year's 21st to 31st is a huge drop for a still-proficient player. Perhaps the Spurs effect?
* A few youngsters follow DeRozan — Donovan Mitchell, Pascal Siakam, and D'Angelo Russell join the top 35 after their performances in the regular season and playoffs. It's a sign of the growing, talented youth in the league at the moment.
* Rounding out the five is Khris Middleton, who had a strong All-Star season with the Bucks. As a Celtics fan, this man is a straight ice-cold killer.
* Chris Paul, after being ranked *11th* last year, isn't even in the Top 35. Ouch.

Today, we'll move on to vote for the top 36-40 players in the NBA. Follow this link to submit your vote: https://forms.gle/zRqPxvbTTrQjZdMp6.

Once again, a reminder that this ranking is **reflective.** We are primarily basing these rankings off the 2018-2019 season and playoffs and how each player performed specifically during that time.

I'll report back with the results at around the same time tomorrow and report the results and move on to the next round.

Thank you for your continued participation!

Any surprises in this bunch? Anyone you thought for sure would get an exclusively NBA contract but didn't? Anyone you just straight up don't know and wonder how they got a sweet deal? Anyone on a two-way contract for your team who you think will see a lot of action?

As a bonus, I'll be posting a comment with the undrafted players who acquired contracts. Let me know if I missed anyone!

A number of commentators have suggested that he gave up so many picks in the trade with OKC because he’ll most likely be out of a job if the trade goes badly (or at least he’ll be out of a job long before those picks are relevant). Again, why?

Morey has pulled off a bunch of great trades for the Rockets, the past five years have surpassed the Yao/T-Mac era in terms of regular season wins and post-season performances, and it’s not like winning championships is the only measure of success. When you’re coming up against a dynasty like the Warriors every year (especially considering the improbable situation that lead to them signing KD), it’s hard to blame the Rockets for their shortcomings. You’re coming up against an all-time great team, and pushing them further than anyone else in the league. This is nothing to be ashamed of, especially considering how close they would have been last year without CP3 going down.

I feel like a number of teams would jump at the chance to hire a GM like Morey. The Knicks (although things appear to be headed in the right direction with their new leadership), Hornets, Suns, Pistons, Bulls, Wizards, and even the Lakers could be potential destinations. So I suppose a secondary question would be, where do you see him landing if the Rockets pull the trigger?",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,61325,public,self,Why is Daryl Morey on the hotseat in Houston?,0,1563758602,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cftil0/why_is_daryl_morey_on_the_hotseat_in_houston/,,,,,,,,,,

I just wish sometimes he would keep the ""woke"" talk to a minimum and talk strictly about basketball if he wants to have an opinion heard. With that being said, his on the court play was terrific with the exception being the playoffs. The other topics about him being a bad leader and him wanting his own team came from media created narratives. The problem with many of these takes about Irving is that they don't apply to the previous season.

I was surprised that the popular opinion is that Celtics are going to be a top 3-4 team in the East but I see why now. The narrative is that they played better without Kyrie because they advanced further in the playoffs without him and the win-loss column from 2019 shows that. Just remember most of those teams were sub .500 teams because they sat their best player versus lesser teams. Almost everyone who missed games from Boston in the 2019 season had their team play ""better"" without them. Horford might be one of the few exceptions if I remember correctly, which whom they replaced with Kanter. Toronto had a better record without Kawhi. Bucks had a good record without Giannis. Philly won 16 games in a row without Embiid in the 2018 season.

They only got out the 1st round in 2018 because of home court provided by Kyrie being there for 60 games which everyone conveniently forgets. Does anyone really think they get that 16 game winning streak without Kyrie bailing them out in like 90% of the games in that span? Boston went on to win only ONE road game in the 2018 playoffs - two less than than the 2019 playoffs.

I'd be willing to bet Toronto will still be better than them as long as they don't lose a key player for an extended period of time through injuries or trades. Also, Boston barely edged out Indiana without Oladipo for the 4th seed this past season - and they got an overpaid but very good upgrade in Malcolm Brogdon. I really believe Celtics will be around a .500 team at best. This is how I see the East breaking down assuming everyone is relatively healthy:

1. Bucks 60-22
2. Sixers 52-30

3. Nets 48-34
4. Pacers 47-35

Welcome back to the (un)official reddit player rankings of the 2019 offseason!

I checked on the poll results from yesterday and I have less than 50 votes so I'm back, requesting for more people to vote. There are currently ties that need to be resolved so please vote so we have a clearer picture of who the next five players to be ranked are. If you can, please vote in the following form: https://forms.gle/tSd7AqKK3cHkparc9.

In the meantime, use the comment sections to discuss who should be a part of the next five or to evaluate the current rankings (is anybody too low/high?).

Once again, a reminder that this ranking is **reflective.** We are primarily basing these rankings off the 2018-2019 season and playoffs and how each player performed specifically during that time.

I'll report back with the results at around the same time tomorrow and hopefully finally move on to 36-40.

Thank you for your participation.

My answer to this question is That LeBron is probably the games most complete offensive player. Unrivaled scoring + playmaking. Steph has limitations when on ball and he benefits from having good screeners and passers to get him open looks off screens and curls. Steph’s offensive production is more predicated  on draymond and warriors elite passing. 

A lot of people will mention Steph’s gravity as to him to being a better offensive player than LeBron but it’s more of the warriors aggressive screening and rescreening in which the big has to always anticipate when warriors’ bigs will screen for curry.

The GSW scheme is using 3-5 screens per play for a 3pt shooter. I don't think another team has done so often before. That's the ""analytical age"" being actualized. They also have a uniquely gifted passing PF to do it.

Warriors do A LOT to get Steph (&amp; Klay) open. They get more screens, more in transition/chaos shots, &amp; wide open shots than all other players in the NBA. aka, TOR box-n-1 was confuse 2x screen men, not double Curry.

LeBron performs the onball scoring and gravity of curry while providing the playmaking of draymond.

East: 

1st seed- Milwaukee Bucks

In my opinion, Milwaukee is the safest bet to win the East this year. With the reigning MVP, COTY, and yet another great supporting cast, the Bucks have shown no big signs of a regression. While the team did lose a great player in Malcolm Brogdon, the remaining core of Giannis, Middleton, Bledsoe, and Lopez is more than enough for them to make another run at the East. Last year those 4 players played a total of 72 games together, so barring injury it will be safe to assume this lineup will get lots of court time this year. Giannis made his biggest step as an NBA superstar last year, and it is safe to assume he hasn’t hit his ceiling yet. He has proved himself to be the best regular season player in the league already, so why can’t he do it again? In a slightly more open East, the Bucks could top their 60 win total from last season.

2nd seed- Philadelphia 76ers

If a 76’ers fan were to argue that in a 7 game series their team would come out of the East this year, I wouldn’t disagree with them. It’s hard to tell on paper if their roster improved or regressed, but you could match up their current roster with anybody in the East. The reason I don’t have Philly as the 1 seed is because of Joel Embiid’s health. Joel Embiid has never played more than 64 games in a season, which is a huge red flag considering the longevity it takes to secure the 1 seed. That team could very well produce 3 all stars this year, and if Ben Simmons gets that jumper everyone is waiting for, their offense will be taken to a whole other level. Overall, the 76ers could easily secure the 2 seed if health is on their side.

3rd seed- Boston Celtics

While the Celtics clearly regressed this offseason, their team could still easily capture the 3rd seed in a decently open East. The roster is much different this year with Kemba Walker replacing Kyrie Irving, the loss of Terry Rozier and Al Horford, and the addition of Enes Kanter, it will be hard to compare this team to any recent Celtics team.  While it's impossible to know exactly why the Celtics were so underwhelming last year, it’s safe to assume that the locker room toxicity that was leaking out to the media will no longer be a problem with them after the departure of Kyrie Irving. Kemba Walker is a great replacement for Kyrie and may very well be a much better system player being under a good coach for the first time in his career. Boston kind of has a thing for small point guards, so i'm sure Kemba will be able to play meaningful Basketball for that franchise. The Celtics look to be a strong regular season and playoff team.

4th seed- Brooklyn Nets
 
After coming off of a surprisingly good season, Brooklyn responded with an even bigger offseason. With the addition of Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, and DeAndre Jordan, the Nets have arguably the best roster in the East. Well, not this year at least. We all know Kevin Durant won’t be back this season, which takes the Nets out of serious championship contention until he gets back. Even though they’re not title contenders yet, they are still a very good team. They kept their young core in Caris LaVert, Jarett Allen, and Spencer Dinwiddie, and added a 2nd Team All-NBA PG in Kyrie Irving. The Nets have great role players in DeAndre Jordan, Joe Harris, and Taurean Prince, so this team should have more than enough to win 50 games this year which could snag the 3rd seed. Health could be an issue with this team, but when we see them at full force they could be an issue for the East.

5th seed- Detroit Pistons

The Pistons have the pieces to put together a 45-48 win season. With former COTY Dwayne Casey, and 3rd team All-NBA forward in Blake Griffin coming off of a fairly healthy season, Their second full season together will have less growing pains and run much smoother than the last. With the addition of Derrick Rose, they will hopefully get some decent time with him coming off the bench, but you never know how many games Rose is going to last. He played 51 games last year for the timberwolves, so if the Pistons can at least get that out of him that should make them a good enough threat to be the 5th seed. Blake Griffin will likely continue geling into the star role, Drummond will likely lead the league in rebounds for the 3rd straight season, and the Pistons are flexible enough to potentially make roster adjustments throughout the season. Health is definitely a concern for this team, but they do have some enough upside to secure a playoff spot.

6th seed- Miami Heat

With many potential free agency destinations and plenty of opportunity to pair up with a star or two, Jimmy Butler chose the star-less Heat for the next chapter of his career. Now that Jimmy is in a lone star role in the Eastern Conference, he will likely return to being an All-Star; with a decent supporting cast around him it should be good for the 6th seed. With a potential starting 5 of Goran Dragic, Jimmy Butler, Justice Winslow, James Johnson and Kelly Olynyk, this team should expect to make the playoffs but most likely bounce in the first round. I can’t figure out where Miami is going with this Jimmy Butler experiment, but for now they are nothing more than a middle of the pack team.

7th seed- Toronto Raptors

The Toronto Raptors just fell victim to the “Player Movement Era” after doing absolutely everything possibly right to obtain Kawhi. They gave him as much rest as he pleased, made good midseason roster adjustments, AND won the championship, yet he’s already gone and the Raptors will have no chance to defend their title. Toronto was a one star team, and now that their one star left, they just have a bunch of good role players. Pascal Siakim looks like he could potentially become an All-Star next season, but he's going to have to take a big leap in his role as the franchise star if they're going to expect to do anything meaningful. The Raptors still have the spare parts to make the playoffs, but until they get “that guy” it’s going to be difficult to matchup with the other Eastern Conference teams. Unless Pascal Siakim becomes the franchise player, the Raptors will soon be prolonging the inevitable rebuild.

8th seed- Indiana Pacers

The Indiana Pacers took a few hits over the past year. With Victor Oladpio rupturing his right quad, and the loss of Bojan Bogdanovic, Thaddeus Young, Darren Collison, and Corey Joseph, the Pacers will likely not match their 48 wins they achieved last year. They did add Malcolm Brogdon, but until Victor Oladipo returns their playoff spot could be in jeopardy. The Orlando Magic are most likely the team to squeeze into the playoffs, but if Oladipo makes a somewhat early return that should be enough to snag the 8th seed. Given the unknown timetable of Oladipo’s return, the 8th seed is the best I can see the Pacers doing this year.


West:


1st seed- Denver Nuggets


The Denver Nuggets look like they could become the best regular season team in the NBA next year. If Jokic continues playing as well as he did during the playoffs, he could be a serious threat to win the MVP award. Jokic is coming off of an 80 game season, with the return of all of the young core and the addition of Jerami Grant; this is a team that is built to last through the regular season and secure a top seed in the playoffs. In the playoffs Jokic outnumbered his regular season averages in Points, Rebounds, Assists, and 3 pt percentage (.39). Jokic left off averaging 25 points-13 rebounds-8.4 assists per game. If Jokic can piece together an 82 game season and continue to improve it will be difficult to top a team like that throughout the regular season. The majority of this team is young players that will only get better as time goes by, so I expect the nuggets to win 60 games in the western conference next year.

2nd seed- Los Angeles Clippers
	
Two words hold the fate of the Clippers playoff seeding this season... Load Management. Last year during the playoffs, something was seriously wrong with Paul George’s shoulders. It required surgery in the offseason and it is a big question mark if he will return to full force right away, but I believe he will make a speedy and full recovery. Obviously Kawhi has been open about his load management and how important it is for him to play so well in the playoffs, so it’s hard to tell exactly how many games either of them end up taking off. Though The Raptors managed to win 58 games with Kawhi’s load management in full effect, and still managed to grab homecourt in the finals. The Clippers have the surrounding cast to win games no matter who is in the lineup, with the great system Doc Rivers has created. With players like Patrick Beverly, Montrezl Harrel, and Louis Williams, they have an array of talent all across the floor. The Clippers have 3 players on their roster that could single handedly close out a game, so I expect the Clippers win total to be high. This team is expected to be the #1 defense next year, and with plenty of offensive weapons it’s going to be really hard to beat this team on any given night. Barring Injury, the Clippers in my opinion the team that wins the championship this year.

3rd seed- Utah Jazz

Primarily Lakers fans are pissed off about this ranking, but it’s almost impossible to sleep of the Jazz’ moves this offseason. Mike Conley has the potential to be a lethal weapon in the Jazz’ offense next season. Mike Conley is a great unselfish scorer who will synergize nicely with Donnovan Mitchell, and Bojan Bogdanovic. Last year the Jazz ranked 2nd in defensive rating and has the reigning DPOY in Rudy Gobert, so with the addition of Mike Conley into that system they could snag at least the 2nd best defense again. This team has a healthy core that will last throughout the regular season, which gives them a perfect swing at the 3 seed.

4th seed- Los Angeles Lakers

The Los Angeles Lakers are another team that you can’t sleep on next year. After giving up what was then the biggest trade haul in history, they finally got Anthony Davis in a Lakers jersey. The Duo of LeBron and Davis will be something special because the duo synergizes so nicely together. The LeBron and AD pick and roll will be borderline unstoppable next year, because LeBron is arguably the best passer and has the highest basketball IQ; to combine that with a player of Anthony Davis’ caliber who can do virtually anything on the floor, it's going to be wild. Much like the other LA team, the Lakers have to worry about load management as well. Anthony Davis has a lengthy medical history that could scare all Lakers fans, but if he has a healthy season he could win the MVP award. LeBron obviously had his first lengthy injury last season which indicates that he likely isn’t going to try to play 82. While it might just take time for the Lakers to find their stride, they should have a good enough season to snag the 4th seed.

5th seed- Houston Rockets

The Houston Rockets are arguably going to be the most interesting experiment out of all the teams next season. With the reunion of James Harden and Russell Westbrook, it’s really going to be interesting seeing how they manage to share only 1 ball. The question everybody had when CP3 arrived in Houston still remains; How are 2 players that are so ball dominant co-exist on the same team? The Rockets, to an extent, made it work though. CP3 and Harden put together a 65 win season their first year together and nearly knocked Golden State out of the playoffs, but we all know they ultimately didn’t, for whatever reason you want to believe. The second year saw Harden having an unsustainable load and managed only 53 wins. While he did have a historic statistical season, The Rockets system ultimately proved it doesn’t work in the playoffs. Chris Paul began to look like a shell of himself on the court, and combining that with the rift between the players, Houston didn’t look like it had many places to go from there. Now, the Rockets have Russell Westbrook. While Russ’ game doesn’t necessarily compliment the existing Rockets System, he still brings a lot of things Chris Paul was unable to bring to the table last season. They now have a second extremely athletic, explosive player that can get to the rim at will. The sheer starpower this Rockets team has should be more than enough to secure a 5th seed, it will just be interesting to see how Russ fits into the system. With pretty much everyone from last years team returning, they have a great chance at putting together an impressive season.

6th seed- Portland Trailblazers
	
The Portland Trailblazers are unfortunately going to be stuck in no mans land for another year. Don’t get me wrong, this is a great team with all their good players returning and nice additions in Hassan Whiteside and Kent Bazemore. Damian Lillard is going to be a top PG in the league next year, McCollum could have a great season, and the team got the 3rd seed for 2 straight years, but in my opinion the above listed teams had more notable additions while the Trail Blazers stayed almost the same. The West is going to be a blood bath, but this is a team that could put up a really good fight.

7th seed- Golden State Warriors

The Golden State Warriors ultimately fell apart due to injury, and it looks like they’re going to continue to directly suffer from that until at least January. Klay Thompson devastatingly suffered an ACL injury in the finals, and is expected to miss the first few months of the season. Much like his teammate Kevin Durant he got hurt in June, which is one of the worst times to suffer a major injury. The Warriors made decent offseason moves, most notably trading for D’Angelo Russell; Though in such a star studded West this injured roster might be solely reliant on Klay’s return. There is a chance we could see MVP Steph return after the departure of Kevin Durant, but with a lackluster bench compared to the pre-KD teams, it will be difficult to hang onto a playoff spot until Klay makes a return. When Klay does return, the Warriors become a team that could cause some trouble in a playoff series.

8th seed- San Antonio Spurs

With the roster the Spurs have right now it would be a sin to not have them in the playoffs. While many Western Conference teams just became better than the Spurs are right now, there is no reason to believe that the team has made the team that has made the playoffs for the past 22 seasons won’t do it again. With the return of Dejounte Murray, the Spurs have a great starting lineup in Murray, DeRozan, Gay, Aldridge, and Peoltl, which will continue to do the great things that have worked under Pop for so long. The Pelicans are the only other real threat for this playoff spot, and while they have a nice roster and a great young core including Zion, I don’t believe that a team that young will be able to end the Spurs playoff appearance streak. The Spurs were a scary 7th seed in the playoffs last year, so there is no indication that this team will dramatically regress.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,61220,public,self,My Way Too Early Playoff Predictions,0,1563656841,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cfd6td/my_way_too_early_playoff_predictions/,,,,,,,,,,

###For those of who would rather get a quick summary, I'll try my best without going too in-depth###

###**Lebron's Drive**### 

* As we all know LeBron is nigh unstoppable on his drives to the rim. Defenses try to force him to drive to his right. 

* The reason being if he drives to his left and defense can't contain him then he scores. If they do try to contain he has mastered his *spin move* where he digs into the defender, creates separation, spins and scores.

* This is especially showcased in transition where his unique combination of speed, size, and finishing with either hand forces defenses to throw multiple defenders at him. 

###Laker's Shooting###

* Lakers roster was horrible last season in 3PT shooting. This year they added a plethora of deadly snippers. Danny Green being the most notable.

* We know he can space the floor and is going to be amazing in half court but he is very efficient at jumping into his shot. This is where the transition offense from earlier comes into play. Defense have to pay attention to Green now as well. 

* Having shooters also helps LeBron drive more cleanly to the basket. Just take a look at how having Danny Green has helped KL last season. Defenders couldn't ignore him like they would Rondo, Lonzo, BI, Kuzma. 

###**The Dominant Big**###

* The Lakers didn't have a stretch big last year. AD isn't an exceptional shooter at all but he does provide that threat. 

* More importantly is the **PnR**. This is AD's greatest strength. He is fast, athletic, has good hands, and a soft touch. This is also LeBron's greatest strength. 

* As we discussed earlier, if LeBron gets an edge on his drive to the left or even right he is going to finish the majority of the time. AD setting the pick and rolling hard to the basket forces the defense with 2 primary options:

* 1 - They can double LeBron off the pick. Essentially forcing him to give the ball up to the big and hopefully get a steal/result in a sloppy pass. Unfortunately LeBron has the height and passing skills to deliver the ball to AD. Usually this kills the set as most bigs hold it and not make a decision. Unfortunately again, AD is not most bigs. He can now either drive to the rim and finish strong or drive and kick it out. 

* 2 - Defense collapse the defense in the paint and the helpside defender has to leave the shooter to cover AD. This mean the defender is going to be leaving Danny Green, Avery Bradley, Cook open in the corner. LeBron is usually pretty spot on with his passes and will make the right decision the majority of the time.

A player like Chris Paul is rare. He is one of the most efficient, productive, impactful, and offensively sound players we have ever seen. Paul is multi-dimensional, being that he was an elite playmaker, defender, and scorer. He - as Lowe said - is the greatest floor general of all time, and is statistically a Top 3 point guard ever. Despite Chris Paul's ability as an individual basketball player, he has never been able to achieve real post season success much less a championship.

Yeah, so that's happening now. You guys overwhelmingly wanted me to expand the rankings to the Top 50 ([72%!](https://imgur.com/a/mHGRrma)), so that's exactly what we'll be doing.

So, welcome back to the (un)official reddit player rankings of the 2019 offseason, now going to the Top 50.

Last time, y'all voted for the top 26-30 players of the NBA. After collecting around 100 votes, here are the results:

Player | Team | Pos | 26th Votes | 27th Votes | 28th Votes | 29th Votes | 30th Votes | Points

Note: The above chart includes only players who got 5 or more votes. There were a few players that got like one vote that I excluded.

Some notes on the data:

* Kyle Lowry, with his 27th place, is the highest ranked player of the reigning champs.
* With the conclusion of the Top 30, we can compare and contrast with last year. Seven players (Victor Oladipo, John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Chris Paul, Gordon Hayward, DeMar DeRozan, Kristaps Porzingis) are no longer Top 30, being replaced by seven other players (Blake Griffin, Bradley Beal, Luka Doncic, Jrue Holiday, Mike Conley, Devin Booker, CJ McCollum).
* Of the seven fallers, four (Oladipo, DMC, Wall, and KP) did not play a sufficient amount of games this year due to injury.
* The other three (Hayward, CP3, and DeRozan) all have their own problems and have therefore dropped out of the top 30.
* 20 out of 30 teams have a top 30 player, a rise from last year's 18.
* The 76ers and Warriors are the only teams to have 3 top 30 players.

Today, we'll move onto vote for the top 31-35 players in the NBA! Follow this link and fill out the form to vote: https://forms.gle/tSd7AqKK3cHkparc9

Once again, a reminder that **this ranking is reflective.** We are primarily basing these rankings off the 2018-2019 season and playoffs and how each player performed specifically during that time.

I'll report back with the results at around the same time tomorrow and move on to 36-40.

Thank you for your continued participation!

First-round picks are collectively recognized as one of the most valuable assets a team can have. 

Based on trades that have occurred the past couple of years I believe the value of firsts have fluctuated. Some questions to think about:
• Have first-round picks lost or gained value over the past couple of years? Especially considering that trades for marquee players like AD and PG13 involved 3+ first round picks.
• Players are increasingly forcing their way out of teams even when signed to a multi-year contract (e.g. Porzingis, Kawhi, PG13). Would this devalue a first-round pick, since the security of a multi-year contract is compromised when drafting?
• What impact will the elimination of the one-and-done rule have on the value of first-round picks? 
• Is it worth spending a lottery pick on a project player with high upside or a more established player? How much should age factor into this discussion?
• Do front offices overvalue first-round picks?

I would encourage anyone who wants to to drop their predictions in the comments as I think it will be fun to look back on. 

**Eastern Conference Standings**

1. 76ers- 58-24 - I think they are going to be like a zone team in the NCCA tournament. Teams that can't preplan for them are going to be thrown off by their massive defence first lineup.

2. Bucks- 57-25 - I think they will regress a tiny bit with the loss of Brogdon

3. Pacers- 50-32 - I think they'll be a very good regular season team especially if Dipo comes back early at full strength

4. Nets - 48-34 - I think Kyrie and healthy Levert are worth a few extra wins

5. Celtics- 47-35 - I think losing Horford and not getting a super convincing replacement is gonna hurt a little

6. Heat - 45-37- I think they'll be a playoff team with Jimmy and I think they probably have another trade left in them

7. Raptors - 44-38 - I think if they keep the gang together for one more year they should make the playoffs in the east. I could easily see them making moves to get better or worse tho.

8. Magic- 42-40 - I think they will be pretty close to the same as last year, maybe a bit better.

9. Pistons- 40-42 - Again, I think they'll be about the same. I could see them making some moves tho.

10. Bulls- 33-49 - They low-key have a pretty nice line-up on paper. I just wouldn't count on a team with a rookie PG to be good.

11. Hawks- 31-51 - They just have too many young guys and rookies for me to trust them to be good

12. Wiz- 29-53 - They are very bad outside of Beal. If Beal gets moved or hurt, they could easily be one of the worst teams in the league

13. Knicks - 22-60- I think it makes sense for them to let RJ run things and just tank for another year

14. Cavs -19-63 - They're another team run by unproven guards that should look to tank again. I would bet on Love getting moved this year.

15. Hornets- 17-65- They were a one-man team and they lost that man.

**Western Conference Standings**

1. Jazz- 58-24 - I think they are primed to be one of the best regular-season teams. They added Conley and Bojan and will probably fight harder for seeding then the Lakers/Rockets/Clippers.

2. Nuggets- 57-25- Thye should be a bit better than last year with guys progressing and adding Grant and MPJ.

3. Clippers- 56-26- I think they'll be really good but would expect more load management and less drive in the regular season. Also, I think Zubac+Harkless+Robinson are getting packaged for another piece at some point this season, hopefully, a big.

4. Rockets- 55-27- They should be better than last year by a bit in the regular season, but you gotta think it'll take a while to figure things out.

5. Lakers- 51-31 - I think people on here are underrating them, but at the same time I think they won't be going balls to the wall in the regular season.

6. Blazers- 50-32- I think they will probably be a bit worse after losing Harkless/Aminu/Kanter and Nurk being injured, especially at the beginning of the season.  I would bet money on Whiteside getting flipped mid-year. Shoutout Ian Karmel tho.

7. Warriors- 46-36 - They have one of the top 7 guys in the league and 2 borderline all-stars (not counting Klay). I think Russel getting flipped mid-season would make a lot of sense. 

8. Spurs- 45-37 - I have not known a year in which the Spurs are not in the playoffs. I'm not 100% sure that would even be allowed.

9. Thunder- 41-41 - They have Ewing Theory potential but I just don't trust CP3 to stay healthy all year or Presti to not sell-off Gallo or CP3.

10. Kings- 41-41- I think they are probably going to be a bit better than last year but there just isn't a ton of room for upward momentum. 

11. Wolves- 38-44 - They are the team that stands out as the most potential to move up with a trade. If they sent out Wiggins and picks for a good player, I think they could be a playoff team.

12. Mavs - 37-45 - I think they should be better than last year with KP coming back. It's hard to think that a team starting Powell, Wright, and THJ will be a serious playoff contender tho. 

13. Pelicans- 33-49 - They have one of the bigger variances in the league with their collection of young guys. If everyone hits, they could be a playoff team but I would think they are much more likely to end up in the 30s for win count.

14. Suns- 21-61 - They could out preform this by like 15 wins without me being too shocked but I just don't trust Rubio and the rooks to add too many wins.

15. Grizz- 19-63 - They have a promising young core but I don't think that will translate to wins just yet.

**1st Round**

**6ers** v Magic: 4-0 It's a 1 v 8

Nets v **Celtics**: 2-4 I think it could go either way but I don't love the Nets forwards outside of Harris. Also, the Celtics have had pretty good playoff success under Brad.

**Pacers** v Heat: 4-2 Jimmy is probably the best player in the series but after that, the Pacers have more talent.

**Bucks** v Raptors: 4-0 I don't think they can compete sans Kawhi

**Jazz** v Spurs: 4-1 The Jazz are better

Rockets v **Lakers**: 3-4 I'll take AD and Lebron over Russ and Harden. I don't trust that fit

**Clippers** v Portland: 4-2 The Clippers are better. Nurk could cause trouble if he's back and the Clips don't make any moves.

Nuggets v **Warriors**: 3-4 This might be controversial but assuming Curry, Klay, and Draymond are healthy the Warriors are a problem. At this point, I think either the D'Angelo experiment was a success or he was flipped for a forward. 

**Round 2**

**6ers** v Celtics: 4-2 I think the 6ers are just better. The Celtics lack of bigs will probably be a big problem in this series. 

**Bucks** v Pacers: 4-1 I just think the Bucks are better. I don't trust any of the Pacers to stop Giannis.

Jazz v **Lakers**: 3-4 Gobert will definitely muck things up for AD and Lebron. The Jazz probably have more talent in aggregate too. With all that said, I just have a hard time betting against the team with the 2 best players in the series. 

**Clippers** v Warriors: 4-2 The Clippers have way better depth and also the top-end talent to match up with the Warriors. 

**Conference Finals**

**76ers** v Bucks: 4-3 I think the 6ers will have problems with spacing and finding a closer, but they are seemingly specifically designed around shutting down Giannis. It's a tough matchup for the Bucks.

**Clippers** v Lakers: 4-2 I really think the Clippers are going to make a move for a big before the playoffs. If they don't, then this series could easily flip. Regardless, the Clippers have the top-end talent to match anyone and maybe the best depth in the league.

**Finals**

6ers v **Clippers**- Again, if the Clippers don't actually trade for a big then Embiid might really wreck shop and flip the series drastically. The depth of the Clippers is about 10x better than the 6ers. They also have 2, maybe 3 guys that I would choose to close a game before taking a 6er. 

**Awards**

**MVP**- Giannis - He is going to put up big numbers as the best player on a top 2 seed and won't split votes with any teammate. I think Russ/Harden, Kawhi/George, and Lebron/AD are all going to split votes; taking out 6 MVP contestants. Curry could do it maybe but it's hard to win as a low seed. Jokic and Embiid are the 2 main competitors imo.

**COY**- Steve Kerr- This is almost impossible to predict because it goes to the coach of the team that over-performed the most. I can at least see the ""no Klay, no KD, no Iggy, no Boogie, no problem"" angle for Kerr.

**ROY**- Zion- I think he's going to be very good. 

**DPOY**- Embiid- I think the 6ers defense is going to be filthy this year. Embiid will be the anchor and best defender on the best defensive team in the league. Definitely could just be Gobert again tho.

**6MOY**- Lou Will- He was almost unanimous last year. I don't see why that would change much

**MIP** - Malcolm Brogdon- This is just a dart throw. But if he plays point guard and goes from 15 and 3 to like 20 and 8, it could happen.

Took a very good Nuggets team to 7 games this season, and is getting two of their **key** backcourt players back (Dejounte Murray and Lonnie Walker) that didn't get to play at all last year, Murray being a starting PG and Walker being likely 6th or 7th man.  When everyone is healthy, they should be one of the better defensive teams in the league due to Pop's schematics and the young players that will be returning.

That brings my main point: Should the Spurs let their young core (Murray, White, Walker, Johnson) develop as they currently contend for the 6th-7th seed, or should they look to trade some of their assets + draft picks for more established stars to pair with DeRozan and LMA?  I don't think many people are speculating about their options, but they're technically a realistic trade away from having one of the strongest lineups in the league.

***Team Breakdown:***

**Spurs Core:** DeMar DeRozan and LMA (Both fringe all-stars)

**Key Supporting Cast:**  DeJounte Murray (All-NBA Defensive Team, young potential future Spurs star), Rudy Gay (Likely sarter, still a very productive player for the time being), DeMarre Carroll (key bench relief for Gay and DeRozan), Derrick White (Another very solid defensive guard)

**Other Contributors:** Lonnie Walker (Promising SG, might be starting with Murray by end of year),  Patty Mills (4th man in backcourt rotation, functional player), Keldon Johnson (2019 draft pick, will likely see some integration Year 1 with his talent), Marcos Bellinelli (Rotation player, picks up minutes from DeRozan, Gay, and Carroll), Jakob Poeltl (young, developing center; frontcourt depth is weak and will likely see heavy minutes at C backing up LMA)

&amp;#x200B;

Most frequented likely lineups: **Murray, White, DeRozan, Gay, LMA** OR **Murray, DeRozan, Carroll, Gay, LMA**

&amp;#x200B;

Both DeRozan and LMA have 2 years left on their contracts.  Should the Spurs push for an ""All-In"" play and try to make this roster more championship competitive by bundling, say, Walker + White + Mills + Draft Pick for a ""compete now"" star? Or, given how strong the West is right now, should they just be content with likely being a 1st round playoff team, and just trust a core of Murray + White + Walker + Johnson to develop for the future and reassess later.

I personally believe that it's worth trading some of their young assets and draft picks for a player like **Bradley Beal** or **Kevin Love** if they can get interest from the Wizards or Cleveland.  If they don't want to give up that many assets, maybe they target **Steven Adams.**  The Beal asking price might be a little high, but I think they can get Love on a fairly good price, maybe giving up 2/3 at most of White / Walker / Johnson, adding Patty Mills and other salary dump, and attaching *maybe* a 1st round pick.  

If they pulled trigger on Kevin Love trade, their starting lineup would likely be: **Murray, DeRozan, Gay, Love, Aldridge.**  They'd still have solid bench contributions left over.  As long as Kevin Love is healthy, or at the very least if he can operate as a good 3rd option to DeRozan and Aldridge (best case he performs on par with them), I think that team should be competitive with anybody, even in the West.

What do people think?  Is sacrificing some of the young core worth it?  I think they can trade for a lot of good players without having to give up Murray since they have other very solid assets, and with them locked in for DeRozan and LMA right now, I don't see the harm in trying to push for contention.

&amp;#x200B;

Beal Trade Scenario:  **Murray/White, Beal, DeRozan, Gay, Aldridge** (Likely giving up 2/3 of White/Murray/Walker/Johnson, exp. salary dump, and 1st + 2nds)

Love Trade Scenario: **Murray, DeRozan, Gay, Love, Aldridge** (Giving up 1/3 or 2/3 of White/Walker/Johnson, exp. salary dump, and 1 1st)

Adams Trade Scenario: **Murray, DeRozan, Gay, Aldridge, Adams** (Give up 1/3 of Murray/Walker/Johnson, exp. salary dump, **maybe** add on a draft pick)

As a Spurs fan, I can't deny the fact that the Raptors won that trade. However, considering that Kawhi tanked his trade value hard by saying that he would only re-sign long term with only the Lakers and the Clippers, I believe that the Spurs did the best they could out of a tough situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

In hindsight though, I wished that the Spurs would have taken the Clippers offer. The Clippers were offering Tobias Harris, 2018 12th Pick, and 2018 13th Pick. Taking that trade package would help the Spurs to accelerate the rebuilding phase and they could orchestrate more trades to obtain more assets (trading Tobias, LaMarcus, moving up or down the draft, etc). But, when you have Gregg Popovich as your coach, rebuilding is not really an option. I don't think that Pop would want to coach his last years on a rebuilding team.  

&amp;#x200B;

The Spurs got DeRozan, a young big in Poeltl, and a 1st round draft pick which helped them to remain competitive in a tough Western Conference. It would have been a cherry on top if the Spurs could have gotten Siakam or Anunoby, but they had no leverage and Masai would have definitely declined. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the other side, the Raptors gambled and won. Sure, Kawhi and Danny ended up being one-year rentals, but the Raptors won a championship as a result.

In the Raptors series, spacing was at times a problem for them.  Simmons was relegated to hanging out in the dunker’s slot on the baseline as Toronto consistently ignored him at the top of the key.  

Then in the off-season, their spacing theoretically gets worse, as they lose Butler and Redick, and add Horford and Richardson.  

The common narrative about the Sixers right now is the most obvious one - they took the eventual champs to 7 games and lost on an incredible buzzer beater, thus, they were a bad bounce away from being champs.  

Here’s my questions for this critical-thinking community:  

1.  Would they have beaten these teams in the 2019 playoffs:  healthy Pacers with Oladipo, Celtics, and Bucks (and why or why not).  My belief is that their unique size presented problems for Toronto’s smaller drive-and-kick guys, but that Milwaukee wouldn’t have had the same trouble (and perhaps neither would the C’s and Pacers with Oladipo).  

2.  Does the floor-spacing ability of the remaining players on the floor become less important if 1-2 guys are already being ignored behind the arc?  In other words, most teams will already concede an Embiid 3, and leave Simmons unguarded, so Horford’s slow release beyond the arc is a non-issue - your team isn’t planning on bending the defense via drive-and-kick anyway (the way the Raptors do, for example).  

I envision the Sixers running a bunch of actions at 16-17 feet and running the least high PnR in the entire league.  

Instead, I expect a Sixers offensive staple staple in the half court will be Post entry pass, then a ‘skinny’ PNR (a guy runs down to the block and sets a screen for the player posting up prior to him dribbling, followed by a one-dribble move to the middle and a jump hook or short lob to the roller who set the screen.  

These are VERY tight passing windows, but they can be very precise passes since most Sixer passes in the half court next year will thrown by guys who tower over the person guarding him, and also because the passes are only traveling 5-15 feet in the air (unlike a drive and kick, high-PnR offense, when the 30-foot skip pass is necessary to bend the defense.  

Does that theory make sense?  In other words, that an elite spot up shooter like Danny Green is paradoxically LESS valuable to a team like the Sixers that has poor spacing, since teams will simply sag off Simmons and the defensive rotations on skip passes are easier?  

TL;DR with sophisticated NBA defense and rotations nowadays, when you go ‘all-in’ on poor spacing with a lineup of great defenders and passers and run zero high PNR it’s actually better than having a well-balanced lineup of 2-3 shooters and 2-3 bigs/passers/defenders.  

You also have the added benefit of playing differently stylistically than every other team in the league, so teams don’t spend much time game-planning for your actions the way they do all training camp for their typically high PnR coverages and communication.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,60837,public,self,"Your thoughts on this theory about spacing, 3’s, and the Sixers",0,1563555468,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cev3mz/your_thoughts_on_this_theory_about_spacing_3s_and/,,,,,,,,,,

Some notes on the data:

* Halleluka! Rookie phenom Luka Doncic made his Top 30 debut with an impressive 24th place. He's so far the only rookie to have made the list this year, and the one of only two rookies to make the list at all (along with Ben Simmons, who made it last year as a rookie).
* Speaking of, the race for 23rd was extremely close between LMA, Luka, and Jrue Holiday — there was a point where they were all tied. LMA and Luka soon seperated themselves, and LMA squeezed out a one-point lead!
* Kyle Lowry, Al Horford, and Nikola Vucevic were also all tied at some point. Eventually it became a race for sixth place, but earlier on they were all a legitimate threat to make Top 25: another reason I had to ask for more votes.
* Draymond Green's addition marks the third Warriors player to make the Top 30 — the most out of all teams.
* Although the Pelicans lost their sole Top 30 player last year, they gain another as Jrue Holiday enters into the Top 30 for the first time this year.
* Draymond Green and LaMarcus Aldridge both didn't change in rank.

Once again, a reminder that **this ranking is reflective.** We are primarily basing these rankings off the 2018-2019 season and playoffs and how each player performed specifically during that time.

I'll report back with the results at around the same time tomorrow and conclude the 2019 offseason's edition of the Reddit NBA Rankings.

As many of us know, in around 2012-2013, ESPN and Sports Illustrated released a series of exposes about the famous Dream Team scrimmage in Monte Carlo. See [SI article here](https://www.si.com/more-sports/2012/07/24/usa-basketball-game-nobody-saw) and ESPN article [here](https://www.espn.co.uk/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/133080/the-scrimmage-in-monte-carlo). This linked with [an ESPN documentary](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1222019-nba-tvs-the-dream-team-a-unique-documentary-for-a-unique-team). 

Basically, we only saw a few clips from the footage, but I always wondered why they only showed a few clips. Did they not have the complete scrimmage? 

Today I stumbled across an article by Jack McCallum, who had written a book about the Dream Team in 2012. The article was written in 2017 and McCallum notes that indeed the complete video of the scrimmage was available (though perhaps not in the best form) and was then claimed by the NBA: 

&gt; When the NBA heard about it, they claimed ownership. Pete complied with their request to surrender the tape to the league, and, subsequently, when the documentary came out, snatches of it appeared.

(This despite the fact that it was filmed by a third party. But I suppose there was in a private facility). 

McCallum notes that: 

&gt; To this day, the entire recording has never been shown publicly, and it’s not my place to show it. But, man, I love the fact that I have it in my bag.

I'm really curious about the existence of this video, and the fact that the NBA refuses to make it available. To this end, there are two interesting questions: 

1. Can McCallum comment on whether the rest of the video (the parts that weren't shown) are of interest? Or is it largely junked recording? Surely he wasn't sworn to secrecy in describing the contents of the video. 

2. Is there any mechanism whereby we can encourage the NBA to make the entire video available? I suppose this is one of those things where the historical and cultural impact may exceed the marketisation impact. Perhaps the NBA really does have financial plans for how the rest of the video is released. But perhaps they are just sitting on it and not doing anything because nobody has asked.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,60803,public,self,The full scrimmage of the 1992 Dream Team intrasquad scrimmage in Monte Carlo does exist but was never released,0,1563543209,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cesjum/the_full_scrimmage_of_the_1992_dream_team/,,,,,,,,,,

What did you see in Terry Rozier's 2018-19 season that made you think he's terrible, and what did you see in that season that offer clues to a way out for Terry to play up to, or even maybe exceed, his new contract?

Well, this is awkward.

First off, sorry that I haven't posted in awhile. I got a pretty bad stomachache and was mostly bedridden.

Second off, I checked on the results every once in awhile even in bed, and we have barely over a 100 votes at the moment. Now, usually I would be OK with this amount, but **currently we have an unusually close race for the next five with even a few ties,** so I thought it would be better to open up the voting session again.

So once again, I'm gonna ask: please vote here for who you think are the top 21-25 players in the NBA, based on their performance in the 2018-2019 season: https://forms.gle/DKRKkZSx48KaS7QR6. You probably shouldn't vote if you already have the last time I posted.

Once again, a reminder that this ranking is **reflective.** We are primarily basing these rankings off the 2018-2019 season and playoffs and how each player performed specifically during that time.

I'll report back with the results at around the same time tomorrow (promise!) and continue on to the last five.

Thank you for your participation!

Of the teams who are in the hunt for the playoffs in the West next season, who do you think is the most likely to withstand an injury to one of their star players and not get passed up by one of the young hungry teams like Sacramento, Dallas, Minnesota, or New Orleans. I’ve included the 8 “most likely” playoff teams below.

Warriors: Steph Curry or Draymond Green. Obviously, these two guys are going to more important to the Warriors success this season than they have been since before KD joined the team. With KD out the door and Klay out for an extended period of time, losing either of these two for a while would really hurt. The Warriors will also be without veterans Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston next season who have both been important parts of their success during their recent run. That being said, it isn’t all bad news for the Warriors; they were able to snag D’Angelo Russell in the sign-and-trade with Brooklyn and also grab Cauley-Stein on a value deal. 

Projected Lineup:

PG: Steph Curry - D’Angelo Russell

SG: D’Angelo Russell - Alec Burks/Jacob Evans

SF: Alfonzo McKinnie - Glenn Rice III/Jacob Evans

PF: Draymond Green - Omari Spellman/Alen Smailagic

C: Kevon Looney - Willie Cauley-Stein


Lakers: LeBron James or Anthony Davis. The roster has clearly gone through a significant overhaul over the course of the offseason, but no addition was bigger than Anthony Davis. It obviously cost them some depth sending out Ball, Ingram, and Hart, but the Lakers were also able to make some key additions in free agency such as Danny Green, DeMarcus Cousins, Avery Bradley, and Quinn Cook while also retaining veterans like McGee, Rondo, and KCP. 

Projected Lineup:

PG: LeBron James - Rajon Rondo - Quinn Cook

SG: Danny Green - Avery Bradley - Troy Daniels

SF: Kyle Kuzma - Kentavious Caldwell-Pope

PF: Anthony Davis - Jared Dudley

C: DeMarcus Cousins - JaVale McGee


Clippers: Kawhi Leonard or Paul George. The Clippers are probably the biggest winners this offseason with their shocking additions of both Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. Even more surprising is that they were able to keep a decent portion of their core that got them to an 8 seed in the West last season in the process. They did lose key contributors from last season in Tobias Harris (mid-season trade), Danilo Gallinari, and Shai Gilgeous-Alecander, but they return Patrick Beverley, Lou Williams, Landry Shamet, Montrezl Harrell, JaMychal Green, and Ivica Zubac. 

Projected Lineup:

PG: Patrick Beverley - Lou Williams

SG: Paul George - Landry Shamet

SF: Kawhi Leonard - Maurice Harkless

PF: JaMychal Green - Montrezl Harrell

C: Ivica Zubac - Montrezl Harrell


Rockets: James Harden or Russell Westbrook. Another one of the big surprises of the offseason (and a crushing blow to my soul) was the trade of Russell Westbrook to the Rockets. Many people have questioned whether or not he fits this roster as well as Chris Paul (he doesn’t), but the reality is that Russell Westbrook is just a more talented player at this point in his career. And regardless, Westbrook is the player they have now. Outside of that acquisition their roster looks pretty similar to how it did last year. The Rockets have had a few changes to their rotation guys, but most of the key contributors are back for another round.

Projected Lineup:

PG: Russell Westbrook - Austin Rivers

SG: James Harden - Eric Gordon

SF: Danuel House - Gerald Green - Gary Clark

PF: PJ Tucker - Isaiah Hartenstein - Anthony Bennett

C: Clint Capela - Tyson Chandler


Jazz: Mike Conley, Donovan Mitchell, and Rudy Gobert. I couldn’t decide on just two for the Jazz, so I went with all three of their star players. Obviously, Conley is the big addition to the roster, but they also added Bojan Bogdanovic who should be a big contributor. Major losses include Ricky Rubio, Jae Crowder, Derrick Favors, and Kyle Korver. In addition to Mitchell and Gobert, the Jazz return key contributors in Exum, Ingles, and O’Neal.

Projected Lineup:

PG: Mike Conley - Dante Exum - Emmanuel Mudiay

SG: Donovan Mitchell - Royce O’Neal

SF: Joe Ingles - Royce O’Neal

PF: Bojan Bogdanovic - Jeff Green

C: Rudy Gobert - Ed Davis


Blazers: Damian Lillard. You’d be hard-pressed to find a team that relies on their star player more than the Blazers. Many people might consider McCollum their second “star,” but putting him and Lillard at the same level seemed dishonest to Lillard’s impact on the team. Like everyone else, the Blazers made some big changes this offseason by sending out Al-Faruoq Aminu, Mo Harkless, and Meyers Leonard. Their big addition was Hassan Whiteside who was brought in to replace the injured Nurkic. The Blazers also added Kent Bazemore, Mario Hezonja, and Anthony Tolliver.

Projected Lineup:

PG: Damian Lillard - Anfernee Simons

SG: CJ McCollum - Rodney Hood - Gary Trent

SF: Kent Bazemore - Mario Hezonja

PF: Anthony Tolliver - Skal Labissiere - Nassir Little

C: Hassan Whiteside - Zach Collins


Nuggets: Nikola Jokic. Similar to the Blazers, the Nuggets revolve around their singular star. His playmaking and general offensive skill are unmatched at the 5 spot in the NBA today. While some might try and argue Jamal Murray as their second star, I just don’t think he’s reached that level yet. The Nuggets didn’t make a lot of noise this offseason in terms of roster changes, but that’s mostly because they already were a deep team of young and improving players. The only real change this offseason comes in the addition of Jerami Grant, a versatile forward with long arms and an improving jump shot. He’s a great depth add, and Michael Porter Jr. can ever come back healthy, this team could become SCARY good real fast.

Projected Lineup:

PG: Jamal Murray - Monte Morris

SG: Gary Harris - Malik Beasley

SF: Will Barton - Torrey Craig

PF: Paul Millsap - Jerami Grant - Juan Hernangomez

C: Nikola Jokic - Mason Plumlee


Spurs: LaMarcus Aldridge or DeMar DeRozan. Never flashy, San Antonio has guys that just get the job done. If it seems like a lifetime since the Spurs have missed the playoffs, it’s because it literally has. The last time they missed the playoffs was 1997 which oddly enough is actually the year I was born. I have also been a fan of their organization and their ability to long-term sustained success. In class Spurs fashion, they didn’t make a whole lot of big moves this offseason. Their biggest news of the offseason may have been the guy they tried to sign but didn’t in Marcus Morris. However, they did manage to add DeMarre Carroll and Trey Lyles. The Spurs will also return Dejounte Murray from injury who should have a major impact this season. 

Projected Lineup:

PG: Dejounte Murray - Derrick White - Patty Mills

SG: DeMar DeRozan - Bryn Forbes - Lonnie Walker

SF: DeMarre Carroll - Marco Bellineli

PF: Rudy Gay - Dante Cunningham - Trey Lyles

C: LaMarcus Aldridge - Jakob Poeltl


Just based on a quick glance at these lineups, I feel like the Lakers, Clippers, and Nuggets have a lot more depth than some of the others. However, some teams are definitely more reliant on their stars than others.

So, I wanted to just run through some potential trades that would do just that.

Trade 1: Demar to Minnesota

Minnesota gets: Demar

Spurs get: Wiggins Minnesota 2021 2023 2025 first-rounders (give or take)

Why: Spurs get a load of picks and Minnesota swaps Wiggins for a star player. I typically don't love teaming up franchise bigs with non-shooters but I think the leap from Wiggins to Demar is enough to justify it. Also, the Spurs have probably the best shot of anyone at turning Wiggins's career around.

Trade 2: Demar to Denver 

Denver gets: Demar

Blazers get: Milsap

Spurs get: Whiteside, Portland 1st, Denver 1st (protected)

Why: Spurs get 2 first-rounders. Portland gets a good PF that can play next to Collins or Nurkic. Denver gets another perimeter guy that can create his own shot. I think Demar should be able to play SF for them and I think Grant should be able to fill most of what Milsap was giving them.

Trade 3: Lamarcus to Portland 

Blazers get: Lamarcus

Spurs get: Whiteside plus some combination of picks and or young guys.

Why: Same basic idea as last time. Lamarcus is a borderline all-star that is familiar with the system and the guys. I'm not 100% he can play next to Nurkic but I think he can.

Trade 4: Lamarcus to the Clippers (mid-season trade)

Clips get: Lamarcus

Spurs get: Mo Harkless, Zubac, Jerome Robinson, and maybe a pick

Why: Lamarcus is much better and more proven than Zubac. I think the Clippers would be hard-pressed to get a better player with their assets and cap space situation. The Spurs get a young center and couple other young lottery tickets.

Trade 5: Lamarcus to Boston

Boston gets: Lamarcus and Metu (just to make money work)

Spurs get: Hayward and a pick

Why: Lamarcus should be able to come in and fill like 95% of the Horford vacuum. The Spurs get a guy that it is about 5 years younger albeit more of a question mark. Potentially you could make this a 3 team trade and direct Hayward elsewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

At first glance, spacing would be a bit of a concern since Beasley is the only legitimate/consistent 3-point threat. However, I do think that Murray and Beasley would compliment each other well on both sides of the ball. I also think that OG could take the tougher defensive matchup at either Forward spot and let Kuzma focus on buckets.  And Jarrett will hold down the paint.

I think those ideas are super interesting but what about adding some incentives to the current summer league tournament to make it must watch TV for NBA fans and encourage participation from the games best young prospect. Here is my idea. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Every member of the winning teams summer league and regular season roster gets $250,000. 2nd place gets 100,000.** This would prevent young players from skipping and would create serious stakes for the final rounds. This would also get the veteran NBA players to be heavily rooting for and promoting the summer league team. Rookies, borderline NBA guys and G league guys who help their team win will not only get an enormous pay day but will be loved by the NBA players they are getting paid. Josh Hart (still on small contract) would instantly become the worlds biggest Jackson Hayes fan if they won (not to mention Zion would still be playing). 
2. **The winning franchise gets some sort of asset (31st overall pick in the next draft, cap forgiveness, an extra MLE, etc).** This would incentive teams to play guys like Zion, Ben Simmons etc.. when they would otherwise bench them. 
3. **Only players with less than 2000 Career NBA minutes are eligible.** Obviously we don't want a situation where real NBA stars are dominating young guys so some sort of rule here would be necessary. I'd be open to increasing the limit so guys like Luka would get a chance to play one more summer league for a chance to win their team some money and draft pick. Not sure if that would make it better but you would have to draw the line somewhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not saying this would revolutionize the league or anything but this could solve the problem of players we want  to watch skipping summer league while also putting some serious stakes on these games which would raise the overall level of competition and in turn make the summer league a better measure of potential NBA talent.

While they both likely have a few years left in them, I was curious about how people think they would fare on their current resumes if they retired right now, in terms of the Hall of Fame.

Both players are late bloomers who became icons for their respective franchises, and have interesting Hall of Fame cases.

Here is the argument for each:

Kyle Lowry

\- Career 14.4 pts, 4.3 rb, 6.1 ast, 42.4% Fg, 36.7% FG3, 80.5% FT, 18.5 PER, WS 86.7

\- [Hall of Fame Odds 65.19% (per Basketball Reference)](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/hof_prob.html)

\- 5x All-Star (from 2015-2019)

\- All-NBA Third Team (2016)

\- NBA Champ (2019)

\- Olympic Gold Medalist (2016)

\- 4 seasons above 10 win shares (high of 11.7 in 2013-2014)

\- top 10 in VORP 3 times (2014, 2016 and 2018)

\- Raptors career leader in playoff scoring, offensive win shares, defensive win shares and value over replacement player (note: same number of seasons with the Raptors as Chris Bosh, one less than Demar DeRozan)

Notes: Most on the Raptors sub consider Kyle Lowry the Raptors GOAT over flashier players like DeRozan, Bosh and Vince Carter (or one-hit wonders like Kawhi), and the advanced stats agree with that analysis. Kyle led the Raptors to their best run in franchise history, with 6 consecutive playoff berths, four consecutive 50 win seasons (high of 59 in 2017-2018), and an 8-3 playoff series record over the past four years.

&amp;#x200B;

Marc Gasol

\- Career 15 pts, 7.7 rb, 4.4 ast, 48.3% FG, 35% FG3, 77.7% FT, 18.5 PER, WS 79.5

\- 3x All-Star (2012, 2015, 2017)

\- All-NBA First Team (2015)

\- All-NBA Second Team (2013)

\- Defensive Player of the Year (2013)

\- NBA All-Defense Second Team (2013)

\- NBA Champ (2019)

\- two seasons above 10 win shares (high of 11.5 in 2012-2013)

\- two seasons in top 10 of VORP (2013 and 2015)

\- Spanish League Champ (2004)

\- Spanish League MVP (2008)

\- Euroscar Player of the Year (2014)

\- World Cup Champion (2006)

\- Olympic Silver (2008 and 2012)

\- EuroBasket Gold (2009 and 2011)

\- EuroBasket Silver (2007)

\- EuroBasket Bronze (2013 and 2017)

\- Grizzlies career leader in Win Shares, Defensive Win Shares, Value over Replacement Player and Rebounds

Notes: Gasol's Basketball Reference Hall of Fame Odds are a [ridiculously low 3.19%](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/hof_prob.html), but the formula they use seems to be largely to blame for that. The formula does not take into account international achievements, defensive achievements (like DPOY), or the difference between an all-star season and an all-NBA season (for instance, in 2013, Marc was DPOY, and Second Team All-NBA, but because he didn't make the all-star team, those achievements do not count towards the formula).

Marc has a strong NBA resume, overall, but not a hall-worthy one. However, his international achievements put him into the conversation. Having a Spanish League title and MVP before entering the NBA is a sizable achievement, and himself and his brother were the driving force behind the most successful period of Spanish Basketball in history, with their Olympic, World Cup and EuroBasket achievements.

In the NBA, Marc was a pillar of the Grit and Grind Grizzlies era, and is largely viewed alongside Mike Conley as the franchise's GOAT for the Grizz.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I like both of them as Hall of Famers. Kyle seems to have done enough in the NBA to warrant a selection, and I think Marc has enough on his resume once the international achievements are taken into account. In another era before advanced stats we might not have appreciated how valuable these guys have each been in their careers, because neither one has the counting stats that jump off the page and neither one has the athletic ability to jump out of the gym. But, both have solidified themselves as top level players, as defensive stalwarts at their respective positions, and as guys with strong advanced stats who consistently help their teams win.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,60587,public,self,After winning the chip are Kyle Lowry and Marc Gasol Hall of Famers?,0,1563386634,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ce0mzd/after_winning_the_chip_are_kyle_lowry_and_marc/,,,,,,,,,,

1- LeBron James, elite at everything. Any type of basketball attribute you can think of he is at least great at it. 4 time MVP 3 chips 3 finals MVPs, came back down 3-1 to arguably the greatest team of all time leading his team in every major statistic for a big portion of those 2016 finals as well. Was a walking finals appearance from 2010 to 2018. Most NBA fans and fans could tell you confidently LeBron is still the best player in the league even at the age of 35.


2- Michael Jordan, greatest scorer of all time, greatest winner of all time not much explanation needed. 5 time MVP 6 chips 

3- Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, had the most unstoppable move ever. One of the longest careers and not prone to injury at all, 6 MVPs all time leading scorer, best big man of all time. 5 chips 

4- Kobe Bryant, Second greatest 2 guard ever, everything Michael Jordan had just worse by a tiny margin. 1 time MVP, 5 chips 

5- Tim Duncan, greatest power forward ever, 5 chips 4 finals MVPs, can do so much more than other guys his size, arguably the best fundamentals, didn't play fancy just played to win.

6- Magic Johnson, arguably the greatest point guard of all time, greatest passer of all time 3 time MVP, could do so many things on the court, I think if he was as good a scorer as he was a passer he would top 3 

7-Larry bird, one of the most clutch players of all time, 3 time MVP 3 time champions 2 time finals mvp. Greatest shooter of the 80s, greatest white player by a large margin.

8- Kevin Durant, arguably the greatest tough shot maker ever, can score the ball at will from literally anywhere on the court. Of the greatest 3 point shooter ever, 1 time MVP 2 time champion 2 time finals MVP, 4 time scoring champion. Top 3 best scorer of all time without a doubt, and not to mention he's a whole 7 feet tall. Can also play defense at an elite level. Only downside is his lack of strength given his thing frame.

9- Shaquille O'Neal, most dominant player of all time, if he wanted to score, all he had to do was get in the paint and overpower anyone that dared to guard him and score with ease. Could run the floor very well, a great passer, and very fast for a guy his size and weight. 4 time champion 3 time finals MVP 1 time MVP.

10. Steph curry, without a doubt the greatest three point shooter ever, elite at rebounding for a guy his size, 2 time MVP with his first being unanimous. 3 time champion. Can play amazing off the ball, and could beat you off the dribble and get an open three, which he would hit.

11- Wilt Chamberlain 1 time MVP 3 time champion and 3 time finals MVP 

12- Oscar Robertson 1 time MVP 

13- Russel Westbrook, walking triple double, 1 time MVP 

14- Moses Malone, 3 time MVP

15- Karl Malone, 2 time MVP 
 
15- John Stockton

16- Elgin Baylor

17- Charles Barkley, 1 time MVP 
 
18- Jerry west 

19- James harden 

20- Kawhi Leonard

Alright guys, I just wanted to say thank you for the amazing response I got to my first post. This sub is fantastic and I am so glad that I found a place for real NBA discussion. So, this is really just a spin-off of my original post (https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cdaea2/what_is_your_idealprototypical_lineup/) that you guys all responded to so well. With the same idea of constructing the best possible lineup, I have put in further stipulations to prevent submissions of 5 max salary guys. I (very subjectively) sorted a pool of NBA starters into three tiers. Tier 1 is full of your number 1 option type of players and are worth $4. Tier 2 is full of guys who may not quite be number 1 options but are still very good players and a clear cut above your average starter and are worth $2. Finally, in Tier 3 you have the rest of the starters who are worth $1. These guys are mostly just average starters/role player type of guys, not the type of guys you build your team around, but a lot of glue guys and solid contributors. Some of these guys were very hard to sort for me, and obviously the tiers would have been more accurate if I had created more of them, but it already took me a while to sort all of these guys so just go with me on this. If you think a guy is rated too highly, don't pick him! If you think a guy is too low, then that's a great a value pick for you!

This sub is fantastic and I am so glad that I found a place for real NBA discussion. So, this is really just a spin-off of my original post (https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cdaea2/what_is_your_idealprototypical_lineup/) that you guys all responded to so well. With the same idea of constructing the best possible lineup, I have put in further stipulations to prevent submissions of 5 max salary guys. I (very subjectively) sorted a pool of NBA starters into three tiers. Tier 1 is full of your number 1 option type of players and are worth $4. Tier 2 is full of guys who may not quite be number 1 options but are still very good players and a clear cut above your average starter and are worth $2. Finally, in Tier 3 you have the rest of the starters who are worth $1. These guys are mostly just average starters/role player type of guys, not the type of guys you build your team around, but a lot of glue guys and solid contributors. Some of these guys were very hard to sort for me, and obviously the tiers would have been more accurate if I had created more of them, but it already took me a while to sort all of these guys so just go with me on this. If you think a guy is rated too highly, don't pick him! If you think a guy is too low, then that's a great a value pick for you!

Who would win? Earlier I was thinking of [this](https://youtu.be/NTng7F_fRbA) tradition in Russia, and thought about the NBA. What if the league's superstars gathered to slap each other for an event? That'd be amazing. Maybe we'd finally see KD and LeBron go head-to-head or slap-to-slap. Or maybe we even see Karl Anthony-Towns and Jimmy Butler work out their differences. Who knows? I know who I believe would win and why. Firstly we have Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks. Standing at around seven feet tall and having hands that are twelve inches wide, Giannis could definitely win this competition. Combine all of that with his seven and a half foot wingspan, and you have yourself a very powerful slapper. Second we have Kawhi Leonard. At six foot seven, Leonard is known as the 'Klaw' due to his massive hands. He has hands that stretch eleven inches wide. Kawhi's reach isn't as great as Antetokounmpo's, however as we've seen countless times before his hands are very strong. We've seen the Klaw rip the ball from opposing players as well as snatch rebounds with as much as three fingers on the ball. I have no doubt that Kawhi could make it far. Third we have Boban Marjanovic. Marjanovic stands at around seven and a half feet while also weighing in at two-hundred ninety pounds. He's a big boi, in fact the largest big boi in the NBA. Boban is tied with Antetokounmpo for the largest hands in the NBA at twelve inches. Boban's slaps might not hit as hard as Giannis' or even Leonard's, only due to his lack of strength. I believe as a possible one or two seed in his side of the bracket, Marjanovic could run away with the title. Lastly, as an honorable mention we have Rajon Rondo. I was debating whether Noah Vonleh would be my honorable mention, but here we are. Rondo stands at six foot one, with ten inch hands. He has the biggest hands in the league for guards, and has a wingspan of six foot nine. I believe Rondo would have a nice amount of power as well as finesse in his slaps. He'd definitely win in a bracket full of guards, but we'd have to see how he does against mixed competition. Who do you think would win in an NBA slapping competition?

**He is still young and absolutely worth it for the team to trust in him**

Yes people will point out his jump-shot but next season will be his third season. He is will continue to improve and even without his shot taking massive strides he is still a great player with other unique attributes. He will give you a 17-8-8.

**His defense and play-making**

He is a great defender and is versatile enough to guard multiple positions not to mention he has great court vision. Surrounding him with multiple shooters or staggering the lineups is a good way to bring out the best of the team. Embiid is a big with injury concerns so having him long excessive minutes is not the smartest idea. Horford, Harris, and Richarson are players who can space the floor and let him operate near the post when Embiid is out.

I'll try to clarify a bit more here.

Awhile back I was watching a game with a co-worker of mine and I asked him who he thinks will win. He quoted to me Lawler’s Law, “First team to 100 points wins”. We had a discussion and it mostly boiled down to me not liking Lawler’s Law since it’s skewed because the better team usually scores 100 first anyway, and of course the higher amount of points you score the higher your win rate is. I jokingly said I’d create a Ferguson’s Law which will be the “First team to X points wins” with a 100% winrate. I’ve had some free time the last few weekends and decided to actually define it.

I spent most of my time just iterating and parsing results through the following in python: https://stats.nba.com/stats/scoreboard/?GameDate=11/01/1996&amp;LeagueID=00&amp;DayOffset=0 and https://stats.nba.com/stats/playbyplay/?GameID=0029600001&amp;StartPeriod=0&amp;EndPeriod=14

I had to extract the play-by-play data to get the scorelines and keep track of the points a team scored first and if the team ended up winning or losing the game. 
Sadly the nba api only goes back to 1996 on play-by-play so It really only works for 1996 on-wards. After parsing all the results and comparing winning vs losing points scored, the scores that only win since 1996 are [(160),(161), (162), (163), (164), (165), (166), (167), (168+)]. These set of points only occur from a sample size of 3 games, Bulls vs Hawks 03/01/2019, SuperSonics (RIP) vs Nuggets 03/16/2008, and Suns vs Nets 12/07/2006.

With this I can look at the other highest scoring games and try to find the actual Ferguson’s Law for all-time. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-scoring_NBA_games

For 03/06/1982 Spurs vs Bucks: https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/07/sports/3-overtimes-and-337-points.html “Gervin made 8 straight points in the third overtime period to stake San Antonio to a 165-161 advantage” So we can cross 160 and 161 off the list. But everything above is fair game. [(162), (163), (164), (165), (166), (167), (168+)]

This is where the news gets kind of depressing and I need peoples help. I’ve been looking into Nets vs Conquistadors 02/14/1975 for the last few weeks but this is the most I can find. https://enewspaper.sandiegouniontribune.com/infinity/article_share.aspx?guid=2ded5ecc-1406-4dca-8e28-72983ca05831 “Again, the Q’s were up by three, but the Nets’ Brian Taylor this time swished a three-pointer while falling forward to lock it up once more at 161. Jabali, moving to forward opposite Erving, then took over. Davis’ 10-footer gave the Q’s a 165-163 advantage, and Jabali then fed Lamar for a 12-footer that made it 167. After Billy Paultz’s free throw for the Nets, Jabali hit two hoops around Erving and it was a secure 171-164.” From this I can conclude the Q’s got to 161 first but that’s off the list, I can’t tell who got to 163 first so that’s a maybe. Ideally I want to find out who scored 163 first. But from 164+ we should be safe. [(163)?, (164), (165), (166), (167), (168+)]

Luckily for the last game Pistons vs Nuggets 12/13/1983 we have youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-rBp5wfXL4 We can see that the Pistons hit 163 (oh no) first. After that, they didn’t have a lead again until 170 points. [(163)?, (170+)]

**Conclusion/TLDR**: I’ve emailed NBA stats about the game but I haven’t heard anything. Does anyone have any more detail or a way to find more detail on the Nets vs Conquistadors 02/14/1975 game? But we can conclude for the NBA, Ferguson’s Law is First to 163 points wins. But for the NBA/ABA, it’s either First to 163 points wins or First to 170 points wins. Or since it's such a small sample size of games that score 163+ we could just all quote Magic's Law ""The team that scores the most will win"".

On another note, for games that didn’t go to OT for 1996 on-wards, Ferguson’s Law is “First to 132 wins”. I also made some pretty interesting graphs below for different parameters of Ferguson’s Law. As a note the Thunder includes the SuperSonics. I can create some more later if anyone is interested. I think one with points scored first vs win % on a line graph could be cool.

So just in case anyone is not familiar, the FIBA World Cup is starting next month in Japan and Team USA will need to make a 12 man team to send over there.

They initially selected a pool of 35 players as candidates for the team in April, and have sliced down the roster to 20 men in June - mostly from players withdrawing their names to prioritise rest. 

The final 12 will be selected at the final Las Vegas training camp in early August, and with the breaking news that AD withdrew his candidacy, it poses an interesting discussion as to who would be selected for the team out of these remaining 19 players:


||Position|Player|2019 All Star|Past Team USA experience|

|1|PG|Damian Lillard|Yes|-|
|2|PG|Kyle Lowry|-|2016 Olympics|
|3|PG|Kemba Walker|Yes|-|
|4|PG/SG|James Harden|Yes|2012 Olympics, 2014 FIBA WC|
|5|SG|Bradley Beal|Yes|-|
|6|SG|Eric Gordon|-|2010 FIBA WC|

|18|C|Brook Lopez|-|-|
|19|C|Myles Turner|-|-|


In the past, Team USA have generally selected **5** guards, **5** forwards and **2** centers. And looking at who is an in form player or has past experience with the national side, these are my picks on who would likely make the team:

||**PG**|**SG**|**SF**|**PF**|**C**|

|4|-|~~Gordon~~|~~Tucker~~|~~Milsap~~|-|
|5|-|~~Mitchell~~|-|-|-|


Lillard and Harden should be automatic locks. Lowry, Love and Drummond have valuable national experience. Walker, Beal &amp; Middleton have been balling out last season. I think Turner will edge out over Lopez due to his rim protection. And I have Harris, Tatum and Kuzma making the cut because of their versatility and shot making abilities.

I found it really interesting, especially seeing what people came up with and the creative lineups people thought up. So to add to the creativity required, I've thought of a different challenge/discussion. If it's not appropriate for this sub then I'm happy to post it elsewhere, I just thought it was an interesting challenge.

So the challenge is; pick a starting 5 of players that did not start a single NBA game last season. There were 82 players that played at least 10 games last year, including some decent (in my opinion) prospects. I compiled the complete list, including their games played, minutes, points, rebounds and assists per game, as well as their effective FG% and PER score. I wasn't 100% sure which statistics to compile, as I'm fairly new to the NBA, so I got the ones that seemed obvious to me. Here's the list:

Some players in particular stood out for me, including Jordan Clarkson, Terrence Ross, Gerald Green and Zach Collins. So my starting 5 would probably be:

PG - Jordan Clarkson - Despite struggling majorly in last year's finals, Clarkson had a good season off the bench for a struggling Cleveland team this year. He scored very well off the bench, including 32.4% off of 5.5 attempts per game from 3. He also shot 84.4% from the free throw line, as well as scoring double figures in 72 of the 81 games he played in. Clarkson provides scoring from the point guard position.

SG - Khyri Thomas - Going for some defense here, as he may not be the most effective on the offensive end, so hopefully can compensate for Clarkson's weaknesses.  There don't seem to be many glaring defensive players in the above list, so Thomas can hopefully provide some of that.

SF - Kyle Korver - The team needs a 3 point shooter and still shot nearly 40% from behind the arc last year, even if he is now 38 years old. He has proven himself at an elite shooting level and could add some of that to this cobbled-together team.

PF - Harry Giles - Despite never starting a game (58 off the bench), Giles impressed on the glass in the second half of the season and showed his work ethic in earning more of the spotlight in Sacramento. He has potential and would bring a drive to the team that is valuable in my opinion.

C - Zach Collins - I've always liked Zach Collins, and he can provide a bit of 3 point shooting as well (33% last year), which is an area where Giles severely lacks. Collins played all 16 games in the playoffs for Portland this year, showing his value to a team like this one. He shows good qualities and could be a good option for the 5th spot on this team.

I would like to hear what others can make with this limited pool of players, as I had to think hard and research some of these players to even put them on the list. Many thanks for reading!

I kept hearing about “Chris Paul being bought out to compete for a championship”. Based on his contract the only way I see OKC doing that if he were to accept a considerable decrease in salary.

From my understanding of the CBA(which I might be wrong about) a player can negotiate up to 30% off his current contract for a buyout. I’m operating under this assumption for the sake of this post if I’m wrong sorry for wasting your time.

Chris Paul has 2 years plus 1 year player option left on his contact totaling in $124,076,442

Hypothetically if he were to decline his 3rd year player option and accept a 30%  decrease in salary OKC would only have to pay him 

**55,905,707.2** for two years

**26,954,537.4 for 2020**

**28,951,169.8 for 2021**

If Chris Paul was really serious about winning a chip over everything else that would be the most realistic for OKC to buy out.

I know Chris Paul is the President of the players association it could cause a bad precedent/Chris Paul just likes money too much to agree to this but I am operating under the assumption Chris Paul wants to win badly enough he would resort to this.

If I’m mistaken on the 30% figure(or if he doesn’t want to lose more than $44,211,146 mil)

Chris Paul could still opt out off his player option offer a buyout for 

**79,865,296** for two years

**38,506,482 in 2020** 

**41,358,814 in 2021**

 That could be more appealing to OKC then trying to attach assets to move cp3’s contract and have a disgruntled star on the roster for one or two years waiting on a favorable opportunity to move him. That cap hit in 2021 however could dissuade them.

I’m going to mention this for the sake of it even though I know OKC won’t accept it but I was curious about this and did the work anyways. 

If Chris Paul want all his years but is willing to negotiate 30% off OKC would have to pay 

**$86,853,509** over 3 years 

$26,954,537.4 for 2020
 
$28,951,169.8 for 2021 

**$30,947,802.2 for 2022**

I don’t see them Buying Chris Paul our for just 30% off of 124,076,442 that’s a lot of money to pay off for no contribution to a roster for 3 years but IDK good will? Not wanting the president of the players union upset? Not wanting a “toxic” presence during a rebuild? I’m struggling to find a reason so it likely doesn’t happen. 

In conclusion IDK I was bored and based off a limited understanding of the CBA I was spitballing for the sake of curiosity and wanted to share my results if anyone else was curious.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,60448,public,self,Realist Chris Paul Buyout scenarios,0,1563302104,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cde455/realist_chris_paul_buyout_scenarios/,,,,,,,,,,

It seems fairly absurd that those 2017 warriors were just three years removed from a first round exit and a sixth seed. So with a coaching change putting a rookie at the helm and no further additions to the core except Shaun Livingston (correct me if I'm factually wrong), they didn't exactly have a standout offseason. Yet they improved on the previous season, and managed 67-15, which is the mark of historically elite teams.

I know that having a elite wing defender like Iguodala off the bench as well as a paradigm-shifting offensive concept helped (as well as the Draymond at 5 lineup), but what exactly was the biggest factor?

Tyler Lydon signed with Sac today and Trey Lyles signed with the Spurs a week or so ago, which means both of the assets Denver acquired for Donovan Mitchell two years ago are gone, with nothing to show for either of them. Even for a trade that happened so recently, this has to go on the short list of most one-sided NBA trades in the 20th century.  

Here’s a brief review of the carnage.

WHAT HAPPENED?

On draft day 2016, the Denver Nuggets traded the draft rights to Donovan Mitchell (the 13th pick) to the Utah Jazz for Trey Lyles and the rights to Tyler Lydon (the 24th pick). 


HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

Well, it all seemed to make plenty of sense at that moment in time. The Nuggets were feeling good about their back court of the future (Jamal Murray and Garry Harris) And were looking to add some depth up front. Lyles has shown some potential as a stretch four",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,60413,public,self,What could have been for the Nuggets: The Nightmare of the Donovan Mitchell trade,0,1563242546,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cdbh80/what_could_have_been_for_the_nuggets_the/,,,,,,,,,,

So, as the title says, who would you put in your ideal lineup? Or, phrased another way, if you were building a lineup from scratch, what kind of players would you want? I’m looking for realistic answers of teams that could at least theoretically exist. You aren’t necessarily restrained to the salary cap, but you obviously aren’t going to have Steph/Harden/Kawhi/AD/Gobert. Here’s mine as an example:

PG - Patrick Beverley: with all the superstar point guards in the league right now, I want someone who can play good defense. I also want somebody who can shoot the ball on offense and Beverley’s 38% career average on 4 threes a game will do the trick.

SG - Klay Thompson: the rationale here is actually pretty similar to Beverley. I want a 2 guard who can provide good defense and spacing. Klay Thompson is elite at both and at 6’7” and 215 pounds, he also has the size to guard the 3 if need be.

SF - LeBron James: from the 3 spot, I need someone who can provide playmaking and versatility. LeBron’s elite playmaking ability is especially important since I prioritized defense over playmaking at the 1. LeBron is not only the perfect point forward, but one of the most complete and versatile players to ever play the game.

PF - Pascal Siakam: again, here I’m looking for versatility, defense, and 3 point shooting. Siakam provides all of that and has showed improvement as a secondary playmaker and creator. He can switch 1 through 4 and bump down to the 3 when LeBron is out or if we need to get another big in the game. 

C - Myles Turner: at the 5 spot, I’m looking for the mythical 3-and-D big man. I want someone who can protect the paint and also help provide spacing at the other end. Turner’s averages of 39% from deep and 2.7 blocks per game last season make him the ideal man to fill that kind of role. He’s really a perfect big for today’s NBA.

Now, when I originally came up with this idea, I was thinking purely starting 5, but I think it would be fun to expand that to essentially an 8 man playoff rotation. Seeing how the key contributors off your bench complement those starters can help justify some of your picks in your “ideal 5.” So, on top of my starting 5, I’m including one backup big, one backup wing, and one backup guard.

Backup Big - Serge Ibaka: I wanted a big with the ability to play the 4 or the 5 depending on the other teams lineup and Serge definitely has the ability to do that. Like Turner, he kind of belongs in that 3-and-D big category even though his 3 pt percentage dropped to 29% last season (career average: 36%). He would be a nice complement to both Turner or Siakam.

Backup Wing - Terrence Ross: for my backup wing, I wanted someone who can at least play average defense and maintain the spacing that we have in our starting lineup. Ross has been a capable defender over the years and averaged 38% from 3 last year on 7 attempts per game.

Backup Guard - Lou Williams: we’ve focused on defense and shooting a lot in our lineup, but we don’t have a whole lot of offensive creators outside of LeBron. I decided to fix that here by adding one of the most potent bench scorers in the NBA. He can come in off the bench and give LeBron a break from being the primary offensive catalyst and the rest of the lineup should be able to help hide him defensively.

With that, we’ve finished our 8 man rotation. I tried to keep it relatively realistic (i.e. try not to put 5 max guys in your starting lineup), but let me know what you think! Where could my lineup be improved? What’s your lineup? I’m genuinely just interested to see what people think.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,60406,public,self,What is your ideal/prototypical lineup?,0,1563236249,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cdaea2/what_is_your_idealprototypical_lineup/,,,,,,,,,,

While these teams came up short, they should still be celebrated for giving us fans some high quality basketball and the potential for an exciting finals. 

Here is my list:

1. 2019 Warriors
2. 2016 Warriors
3. 2017 Cavaliers
4. 2013 Spurs
5. 2012 Thunder
6. 2010 Celtics
7. 2011 Heat
8. 2015 Cavaliers 
9. 2014 Heat
10. 2018 Cavaliers

In my opinion, the '19 Warriors had the greatest starting 5 ever assembled. They had a weak bench and poor depth overall, which ultimately cost them in the finals, but when fully healthy, they had the talent to match up against anyone.

The '16 (73-9) Warriors had an amazing regular season and Steph Curry became the only unanimous MVP in NBA history. Ultimately what doomed them was a combination of injuries, an untimely suspension, and Lebron + Kyrie dominating as a tandem.

The '17 Cavs were one of the best offensive teams of the 2010s but lacked the defensive discipline to slow down a juggernaut in the '17 Warriors. They blazed through the eastern conference playoffs only to get dominated by a better team overall. This is a classic case of a great team running into an all time great team in the finals.

The '13 Spurs were a couple free throws and bounces of the ball away from a title but came up short. They had the talent and the cohesiveness to beat anyone but came up inches short.

The '12 Thunder had an abundance of young talent in young Westbrook, Durant, and Harden. They, like the '17 Cavaliers, ran into a great team featuring a Lebron on a mission to get his first ring. This Thunder team had the explosiveness to compete with any team of this decade.

The '10 Celtics are a somewhat underrated but still a great team. They took the Lakers to 7 in a classic NBA finals series. This was a great defensive team with the star power to match. 

The '11 Heat were heavy favorites for the title but lack of cohesiveness doomed them against an inspired Mavericks team. Although they lost a series they should have won based on talent alone, they are still a good team only limited by their lack of cohesion in the first year of the Big 3 era.

The '15 Cavaliers ran into a series of untimely injuries in the finals which cost them a chance at the title against a deeper Warriors team. 

The '14 Heat was a team on its last legs in its present iteration which ran into a better and more determined Spurs team. 

Lastly, the '18 Cavaliers lacked depth behind Lebron and struggled to get out of a relatively weak eastern conference. They were predictably dispatched in timely fashion in the finals.

I had a question about the way offensive rating is calculated. I was looking at the box score for the Cavs v Warriors game 1 in 2018, which says that Patrick McCaw had an [ORtg of 250](https://i.imgur.com/qXRS3Lh.png) in about 3 minutes. 

A player's Offensive rating is defined by the number of points his team scores while he's on the court over the number of possessions that he is on the court for, multiplied by 100. 

However, looking at the play-by-play, McCaw only had [7 offensive possessions](https://i.imgur.com/JCCXYHE.png) in which his team scored 6 points. Apart from being subbed in with 2 seconds left to go in the game, McCaw saw no other action.

The few that I could find are Detroit, Miami, and Orlando. And, honestly, Miami doesn't actually make sense to me but the conventional wisdom seems to be leaning that way so I included them. 

Trade 1: Miami

Miami receives: CP3

OKC receives: James Johnson, Courtney Lee, maybe a protected pick from Dallas

Dallas receives: Dragic

Why: OKC drops Paul's contract. Miami gets a second star and Pat Riley just doesn't care about the future I guess. Dallas gets a good PG who already has ties to their franchise guy.

Trade 2: Orlando

Orlando receives: CP3 and Terrence Ferguson

OKC receives: Evan Fournier, Fultz, and DJ Augustin (any of these guys could have potential value in a re-direct)

Why: OKC gets rid of CP3 and gets guys that are all pretty much positive or neutral value. Orlando gets the Point God to help their thousand big roster shine and Terrence Ferguson isn't nothing. I think it would help them return to the playoffs, increase fan interest, and potentially make some of their bigs look more valuable. 

Trade 3: Detriot 

Detriot receives: CP3

OKC receives: Reggie Jackson, Tony Snell, Isaiah Whiteside

Why: I think you can probably guess why I think OKC would do it. Detroit gets a much better PG to help facilitate for their twin towers. Notably, this would also be hilarious because of CP3's and Blake's history and Reggie and OKC's history. 


They also have Gallo as a trade asset. So many teams are either locked into their current team or too young to justify trading for a 30 yr old on an expiring contract that Gallo trade partners are still pretty limited. A few that were interesting to me were Minnesota, San Antonio, Boston, and Portland.
San Antonio has too many recently signed contracts for me to work it out in the trade machine. But something along the lines of Gay and Belinelli and some sweetener for Gallo would make some sense mid-season.

Trade 1: Boston

Boston Receives: Roberson and Gallo

OKC Receives: Gordon Hayward

Why: I think Gallo is a better fit with the Celtics core. He's a more natural fit at PF and a better shooter, especially on catch and shoot 3s (44.4% on 4 attempts a game vs 35.8% on 2.4). Roberson is just in there for salary but if he comes back you get a great defender in the deal as well. The Thunder get a higher upside player. Frankly, you could tell me either side would have to add sweeteners and I would believe you so I didn't mess with it.

Team 2 Portland:

This was covered in a thread yesterday. Whiteside or Bazemore and a pick would get it down.

Team 3: Minnesota

Minnesota receives: Gallo

OKC receives: Wiggins and picks

Why: OKC takes on a young player on a terrible contract for picks.

It's the first time we get to see rookie prospects against NBA caliber(ish) athletes and the first taste of the new season.

There's been a lot of dismissal on the important of Summer League when it comes to scouting players, specifically high pedigree prospects who struggle like RJ Barrett. While I think there are things to keep in mind about the specific context that is the Summer League, I think it's really foolish to disregard it as a piece of data.

What about player performances do you care about for Summer League? Are there any players you remember having your opinion changed on by Summer League and was the data from Summer League actually indicative of their outcome?

I think Summer League sample size is obviously way too small to take shooting percentages as encouraging or discouraging, but I do think its worth considering how confident and how many attempts someone takes as well as how their stroke looks.

I also think it shows how players begin to deal with better athletes than they face in college. It's very concerning if players can't beat their initial man in Summer League, as they will only be facing better and smarter athletes in the NBA (albeit with better spacing).

Thirdly, I watch for effort and feel for the game (mostly seen by defensive rotations and passing in the more stagnant summer league ecosystem where cutting is rather rare) are things that can really pop during the Summer League.

Lastly, I'd say I don't particularly put much stock into second year players dominating summer league if they got major minutes in the NBA, but think it's really concerning when they don't (like Dragan Bender or Josh Jackson in their second year of Summer League).

I remember being really impressed by Mitchell Robinson's effort level last Summer League. Given his mysterious status as a prospect, his projections were certainly high variance, but by summer league I believed in him having a high floor (for a second round pick at least) because his effort plus athletic gifts were off the charts.

I also remembering being really impressed by Derrick Jones JR last summer league after not being familiar with him outside of being a great dunker. He was shooting with a good amount of confidence, was applying his athleticism everywhere, and was an extremely decisive player off the catch in Summer League.

Conversely, I think I was a bit too excited about Kevin Knox after his summer league before his rookie year (although in retrospect, I think considering his inefficiency, that summer league performance was overrated).",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,60226,public,self,What do you take from Summer League,0,1563180200,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cd0u1f/what_do_you_take_from_summer_league/,,,,,,,,,,

The roster around them is filled with young guys. Unless Derozan just feels comfortable in San Antonio after two years, I don’t see any reason for him to stay in an average situation while teams like the LAs, Houston, Denver, Utah, and Portland continue to improve. 

Needless to say, the Spurs are in a bit of a quandary. Do they try to keep DeRozan on board and sell him on settling down long term? Do they realize he could leave for nothing and trade him at the deadline to get younger? Do they still try to convince themselves as one of the best teams in the West? 

Derozan is still a really good player, but I don’t know how the Spurs keeping him for five more years potentially does any good. His game isn’t modernized, he’s not a good floor-spacer, his defense is so-so, and he could be a rental. Their team is younger, but he’s at a competitive stage in his career.

He’s paraded himself as saying he doesn’t really need to add one to his game or work on it consistently. Adding a jump shot to his game that teams would have to respect would arguably make him a top 10 player in the league and elevate his game and Philly as a whole. It’s very confusing to me as to why he seemingly refuses to work harder to add that one piece that could make him a superstar in this league. He repeatedly brushes off questions from the media about it and never wants to acknowledge the fact that he isn’t putting in the work to do so. 

And I’m very concerned Philly doesn’t really seem to pushing him to work on his shot either. I’d have very very serious doubts signing him to such a large extension and making him a future without him at least working harder on that aspect of his game. What do you all make of this?

Clippers, Lakers, Rockets, Nets, Jazz, Knicks, Thunder, and Heat are the most talked about teams right now. We get it. \n\nBut what about the more low-key moves this summer? Every year we do this - talk incessantly about the obvious teams, and once the regular season comes around, teams like last year\'s Nets, Bucks, Kings, Clippers shock the league with massive year-to-year improvements that no one saw coming. So this year, let\'s get ahead of the curve, and discuss a prime candidate for one of those massive jumps: the *Chicago Bulls*. \n\n***\n\n**What happened last season?**\n\nThe Bulls record was 22-60. The worst record since the Post-MJ era Baby Bulls.\n\nIt wasn\'t the season a lot of fans had hoped for. LaVine was coming back fully recovered from his ACL injury, Lauri Markkanen was coming off a 1st team All Rookie selection (joining Mitchell, Tatum, Simmons, and Kuzma) and breaking Lillard\'s record for least amount of games to reach 100 three\'s... as a true 7 footer. He was also sharing his offseason training where he looked completely jacked compared to his rookie season, with a reported 14lbs of muscle gained and dominant performances in FIBA qualifiers. There was the drafting of Wendell Carter Jr, a do-it-all center from Duke. Kris Dunn showed out on both ends of the court and made an incredible improvement from his disappointing rookie season in Minnesota. Things were looking up for a 27 win team coached by Fred Hoiberg and had a 7-game win streak in a scorching-hot late December run. \n\nSo what went wrong? Looking at it chronologically, the team was set up to fail from that offseason coming into 2018-19. The Bulls made essentially one move in FA that year, and it was giving Jabari Parker a 2yr, 40M contract (team option second year). Look, Jabari was considered to still have upside after finally coming back healthy but being stuck on the bench with the Bucks. He was still young, pretty athletic, and could score in bunches. The Bulls had a HUGE hole at the 3 spot, given that Justin Holiday and rookie Chandler Hutchison were the only viable options at that position. Jabari was given what functioned as a 1 year deal to fill in that position of need. That was the first big mistake. As the season came along, it became apparent that Jabari had no interest or ability to play defense, and especially not as an un-natural fit at the Small Forward spot. \n\nHowever, Jabari wasn\'t the biggest reason why the Bulls ended up with 22 wins. Maybe not even the second biggest reason. The main culprit for such a disastrous season was: Injuries. Let\'s look at who was affected and how long.\n\n* Lauri Markkanen (elbow sprain in training camp): **23 games** missed due to this specific injury, returned December 1st against HOU. Said himself later on in the season that he rushed himself back and didn\'t feel back at 100% until around All Star Break. Starting PF for the team and secondary scorer behind LaVine. \n\n* Bobby Portis (knee sprain 4 games into the season): **22 games** missed due to this knee injury. Came back for 5 games until he was injured again, this time an ankle sprain, missing another 7 games. Backup PF behind Lauri and main scorer off the bench in a 6th man role. \n\n* Kris Dunn (knee sprain 1 game into the season): **24 games** missed. Also worth noting, Kris missed the first 2 games of the season because of the birth of his child. Came back mid-December not looking like the player from the season prior.\n\n* Denzel Valentine (ankle surgery): **82 games** missed. Our backup SG/SF and one of the best 3pt shooters on the team was supposed to play last season but an offseason ankle injury ended up causing him to undergo surgery and miss out completely on the 18-19 season. \n\nThis was the slew of early-season injuries to an already shallow rotation that ended up nipping any hopes of postseason play in the bud. Zach LaVine was a 1-man show for the first 2 months of the season, playing with Justin Holiday, Wendell Carter Jr, Robin Lopez, and a smorgasbord of G-league talent in what amounted to 5 wins in 22 games played. \n\nAt that point though, the tank for a high pick had already commenced. Jabari Parker was playing starter\'s minutes, Antonio Blakeney was chucking like a 0.001-cent store Kobe Bryant, and Cristiano Felicio was... checking into games. It was a tough sight to see. But wait! It got worse.\n\n1 game after Lauri Markkanen\'s return to the lineup, head coach Fred Hoiberg was surprisingly sacked and lead assistant Jim Boylen was promoted. Things started off well with a huge win at home against the Thunder with a game-winning shot from Lauri Markkanen, and then suddenly things took a hard left turn. \n\nThe mandate from the FO was that they needed Boylen to bring back toughness and grit to a softened team under the mild-mannered Fred Hoiberg. This became an issue when the team had a Back-to-Back against the Celtics right after the aforementioned win against the Thunder, and then ANOTHER game 1 day afterwards. This sparked the ""mutiny"" that got so much press and was quite misreported. The players had a dialogue with the coaching staff to discuss not practicing the day after a back to back and before another game since they had already been getting killed in practices every since Boylen took over a week prior. Players were concerned about their health. The coaching staff responded well to their concerns. The media had a field-day with it. \n\nFor the rest of December and January, the team had a miserable stretch. Wendell Carter was shut down for the rest of the season because of a thumb injury requiring surgery. Chandler Hutchison was lost a few games later with a foot fracture. Boylen was coming under a lot of fire because he was making massive playstyle changes to the team midseason. He was infamously quoted saying &gt; “We have to crawl before we walk, and we’ve got to walk before we run,’’ by KC Johnson of the Chicago Tribune. This meant that the Bulls would play at 80s level pace in order to focus on defense and the fundamentals until they would be able to start running it up and down like a modern team again. \n\nThe ""running"" didn\'t happen until February, once the team acquired Otto Porter Jr. from the Wizards in exchange for Jabari Parker, Bobby Portis, and a 2nd round pick. Now the Bulls finally had a Small Forward. Otto needed to no time to integrate himself into the starting lineup and being an extremely productive and efficient piece in the Bulls\' 6 win February stretch and scoring a CAREER-high 37 points in just his 4th game in Chicago. \n\nBoth Lauri Markkanen and Zach LaVine had torrid performances in February, namely with Lauri averaging 26pts/12rebs in the new-look ""multiple ball handler"" Boylen offense. Lauri, LaVine, and Otto were given the green light to handle and push the ball up the court anytime they rebounded the ball, and resulted in a top-of-the-league Bulls offense for that stretch. \n\nOnce March hit however, a few minor injuries to Otto Porter and Zach LaVine took them out of the lineup indefinitely, and then Lauri was facing some physical exhaustion issues that ultimately gave way to some pretty heavy late-season tanking. The starters were essentially shut down in early March. \n\nSo to recap, those 22 wins don\'t tell the full story for the 2018-19 Bulls. The early season slew of injuries, coaching change, multiple playstyle changes, and hard tanking were the reasons why such a low win total was achieved despite the amount of talent on the team. \n\nZach LaVine had a remarkably productive season as a 23 year old averaging 23.7pts/4.7reb/4.5ast on very [efficient shooting splits](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/lavinza01.html) and renewed Pre-ACL level bounce. \n\nLauri Markkanen, despite his shooting elbow sprain, averaged 18.7pts/9reb/1.4ast on [efficient shooting as well](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/markkla01.html) in his second season aged 21 years old. \n\nThis young, dynamic duo showed that they can dominate games together during their healthy stretches. The question heading into the offseason is if they can make the jump to All Star level, and whether management was going to be able to surround them with veterans and NBA talent. This is where we are now. \n\n***\n\n**2019 Offseason, Phase 1**\n\nFor the Bulls, the offseason started much earlier than others. It could be argued that their offseason began with the Otto Porter Jr. trade, which was reportedly considered by the FO as the only way to get a player of his caliber to come to this young team. What we saw from Otto on the Bulls was a test-drive, according to GarPax. He has a big-money contract that the team was able to absorb with ample salary cap space, and they would factor that in to what moves they\'d be able to make once the actual Free Agency started. \n\nBefore then, however, two big moves occurred. The vacancy left on the coaching staff as a result of Boylen\'s promotion had to be filled. Then, the vacancy left by Pete Myers\' sudden resignation also had to be filled. For the Lead Assistant coach position, Jim Boylen recruited Chris Fleming from the Brooklyn Nets. Dubbed as an offensive guru and developmental coach that played a huge role in Brooklyn\'s surprising improvement, he would balance out well with Boylen\'s defensive specialty and the youth of the team. For the other assistant coaching position, Boylen recruited Roy Rodgers of the Houston Rockets, a defensive-minded coach that focuses on the development of bigs. Heavily credited with the development of Clint Capela, Rodgers decided to come to a situation with two highly talented frontcourt players in Lauri Markkanen and Wendell Carter Jr. \n\nThese hirings come from winning franchises, both have experience and individual success, and fit the direction of the young, up-and-coming Bulls. A huge improvement over what the Bulls coaching bench looked like even prior that season. Having the entire offseason to design an offense and implement a system in training camp will be a huge advantage for Boylen compared to last year. \n\n**2019 Offseason, Phase 2**\n\nStarting with the NBA Draft, the Bulls continued the offseason plan by selecting PG Coby White (7th) and C Daniel Gafford (38th). Both selections filled positions of need and represented BPA. A strong draft day which adds two players that can push the pace in transition and have skillsets that will complement the high-tempo playstyle that the Bulls intend to play with next year. Coby adds a shooting and size element at his position that will also allow the Bulls to have a more spaced and switchable lineup. \n\nThen came July 1st. That\'s when the NBA fireworks go off, in case you were wondering. Lost in the big-name signings, the Bulls were able to strike deals with Thaddeus Young from the Pacers and Tomas Satoransky from the Wizards. Both were signed to 3yr deals (41M for Thad, 30M for Sato) and represent complementary veterans to help the Bulls field ten NBA players. Thaddeus, one of the most impactful defenders and durable player in the league, looks to come off the bench as the PF behind Lauri Markkanen, and the 27 year old, 41% 3pt shooting Satoransky could end up as the starting PG out of training camp, until Coby White is ready to lead an NBA squad. The following day, the Bulls signed Luke Kornet from the Knicks, another 7ft pure shooter from 3. This underrated signing allows for the Bulls to now run the same offensive sets that Lauri Markkanen gets with Luke Kornet off the bench. Coach Jim Boylen added after the signing that the Bulls were looking for ""redundancy"" between the playstyles of their starters and bench unit. The projected lineup for the Bulls follows:\n\n* PG: Tomas Satoransky, Coby White, Ryan Arcidiacono\n* SG: Zach LaVine, Denzel Valentine, Kris Dunn, Antonio Blakeney\n* SF: Otto Porter Jr, Chandler Hutchison\n* PF: Lauri Markkanen, Thaddeus Young, Luke Kornet\n*  C: Wendell Carter Jr, Daniel Gafford, Cristiano Felicio \n\nThe additions of Otto Porter, Coby White, Daniel Gafford, Thaddeus Young, Tomas Satoransky, and Luke Kornet allows the Bulls to have a legitimate 10-man rotation with shooting, size, experience, and defensive acumen. This is not something that the Bulls had in the first two years of the rebuild. What these moves should tell NBA fans is that the Bulls are done Tanking. The FO has set up this team to move into the next phase of the rebuild: playoff contention. \n\n***\n\n**Conclusion/TLDR**\n\nWhile much of the desired improvement will depend on the internal development of the team\'s young talent, we cannot deny that the Bulls have taken this offseason to set themselves up for success. The coaching hires (Fleming, Rodgers), draft choices (White, Gafford), and FA signings (Young, Satoransky, Kornet, *Otto) that were made all seem to be priming this team for their first postseason appearance in 2 years. Contrary to what last season\'s record suggested, the Bulls are one of the most talented young teams in the entire NBA, and with the All Star Game being hosted in Chicago this year, there is added motivation for both Lauri Markkanen and Zach LaVine to take the next step towards NBA stardom. \n\n**Now** is the time to take this Bulls team seriously.', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a whirlwind of moves made for the top players of the 2019 Summer FA class, most NBA conversations are naturally focused on who the title favorites are, who&amp;#39;s going to be in the conversation, or who lost out big once the dust settles.

The early season slew of injuries, coaching change, multiple playstyle changes, and hard tanking were the reasons why such a low win total was achieved despite the amount of talent on the team. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zach LaVine had a remarkably productive season as a 23 year old averaging 23.7pts/4.7reb/4.5ast on very &lt;a href=""https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/lavinza01.html""&gt;efficient shooting splits&lt;/a&gt; and renewed Pre-ACL level bounce. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lauri Markkanen, despite his shooting elbow sprain, averaged 18.7pts/9reb/1.4ast on &lt;a href=""https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/markkla01.html""&gt;efficient shooting as well&lt;/a&gt; in his second season aged 21 years old. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This young, dynamic duo showed that they can dominate games together during their healthy stretches. The question heading into the offseason is if they can make the jump to All Star level, and whether management was going to be able to surround them with veterans and NBA talent. This is where we are now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2019 Offseason, Phase 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the Bulls, the offseason started much earlier than others. It could be argued that their offseason began with the Otto Porter Jr. trade, which was reportedly considered by the FO as the only way to get a player of his caliber to come to this young team. What we saw from Otto on the Bulls was a test-drive, according to GarPax. He has a big-money contract that the team was able to absorb with ample salary cap space, and they would factor that in to what moves they&amp;#39;d be able to make once the actual Free Agency started. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before then, however, two big moves occurred. The vacancy left on the coaching staff as a result of Boylen&amp;#39;s promotion had to be filled. Then, the vacancy left by Pete Myers&amp;#39; sudden resignation also had to be filled. For the Lead Assistant coach position, Jim Boylen recruited Chris Fleming from the Brooklyn Nets. Dubbed as an offensive guru and developmental coach that played a huge role in Brooklyn&amp;#39;s surprising improvement, he would balance out well with Boylen&amp;#39;s defensive specialty and the youth of the team. For the other assistant coaching position, Boylen recruited Roy Rodgers of the Houston Rockets, a defensive-minded coach that focuses on the development of bigs. Heavily credited with the development of Clint Capela, Rodgers decided to come to a situation with two highly talented frontcourt players in Lauri Markkanen and Wendell Carter Jr. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These hirings come from winning franchises, both have experience and individual success, and fit the direction of the young, up-and-coming Bulls. A huge improvement over what the Bulls coaching bench looked like even prior that season. Having the entire offseason to design an offense and implement a system in training camp will be a huge advantage for Boylen compared to last year. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2019 Offseason, Phase 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Starting with the NBA Draft, the Bulls continued the offseason plan by selecting PG Coby White (7th) and C Daniel Gafford (38th). Both selections filled positions of need and represented BPA. A strong draft day which adds two players that can push the pace in transition and have skillsets that will complement the high-tempo playstyle that the Bulls intend to play with next year. Coby adds a shooting and size element at his position that will also allow the Bulls to have a more spaced and switchable lineup. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then came July 1st. That&amp;#39;s when the NBA fireworks go off, in case you were wondering. Lost in the big-name signings, the Bulls were able to strike deals with Thaddeus Young from the Pacers and Tomas Satoransky from the Wizards. Both were signed to 3yr deals (41M for Thad, 30M for Sato) and represent complementary veterans to help the Bulls field ten NBA players. Thaddeus, one of the most impactful defenders and durable player in the league, looks to come off the bench as the PF behind Lauri Markkanen, and the 27 year old, 41% 3pt shooting Satoransky could end up as the starting PG out of training camp, until Coby White is ready to lead an NBA squad. The following day, the Bulls signed Luke Kornet from the Knicks, another 7ft pure shooter from 3. This underrated signing allows for the Bulls to now run the same offensive sets that Lauri Markkanen gets with Luke Kornet off the bench. Coach Jim Boylen added after the signing that the Bulls were looking for &amp;quot;redundancy&amp;quot; between the playstyles of their starters and bench unit. The projected lineup for the Bulls follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;PG: Tomas Satoransky, Coby White, Ryan Arcidiacono&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;SG: Zach LaVine, Denzel Valentine, Kris Dunn, Antonio Blakeney&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;SF: Otto Porter Jr, Chandler Hutchison&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;PF: Lauri Markkanen, Thaddeus Young, Luke Kornet&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; C: Wendell Carter Jr, Daniel Gafford, Cristiano Felicio &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The additions of Otto Porter, Coby White, Daniel Gafford, Thaddeus Young, Tomas Satoransky, and Luke Kornet allows the Bulls to have a legitimate 10-man rotation with shooting, size, experience, and defensive acumen. This is not something that the Bulls had in the first two years of the rebuild. What these moves should tell NBA fans is that the Bulls are done Tanking. The FO has set up this team to move into the next phase of the rebuild: playoff contention. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion/TLDR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While much of the desired improvement will depend on the internal development of the team&amp;#39;s young talent, we cannot deny that the Bulls have taken this offseason to set themselves up for success. The coaching hires (Fleming, Rodgers), draft choices (White, Gafford), and FA signings (Young, Satoransky, Kornet, *Otto) that were made all seem to be priming this team for their first postseason appearance in 2 years. Contrary to what last season&amp;#39;s record suggested, the Bulls are one of the most talented young teams in the entire NBA, and with the All Star Game being hosted in Chicago this year, there is added motivation for both Lauri Markkanen and Zach LaVine to take the next step towards NBA stardom. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now&lt;/strong&gt; is the time to take this Bulls team seriously.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'nba', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2qo4s', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/nba', 'subreddit_subscribers': 2515154, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': None, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'thumbnail_height': None, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'title': '[OC] A look at the Chicago Bulls 2019 Offseason: How a massive player and coaching overhaul could position the team for their first Playoff berth since the Jimmy Butler trade.', 'total_awards_received': 0, 'ups': 68, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ccv4p7/oc_a_look_at_the_chicago_bulls_2019_offseason_how/', 'user_reports': [], 'view_count': None, 'visited': False, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}]",,140.0,140.0,,,

Small market teams are still having their star players leave. Most notably Anthony Davis. Additionally, we are also seeing players leave teams for less money on long deals in other places. This may sound a little crazy but what if the NBA created a 'super short' contract.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is how it would work

1. A 2-year contract for something in the range of 120-140 M (60-70M per year), however, it only counts towards your salary as much as a supermax
2. Teams may only have one player on their team under this contract at all times. Thus they cannot trade for another player under this contract nor offer it to another player. They may, however, offer it to another player once the first super short is finished
3. \*\*\* (Not sure about this one) A player can only sign one super short with a particular team. They CANNOT ask for it again. They can, however, ask for the supermax once the 2-year contract is up. 
4. Qualifications for the 'super short' are the same as the supermax.

&amp;#x200B;

This way, teams will not be screwed over by long contracts which may affect their cap flexibility in the long term. An example of this is how Charlotte was unwilling to offer Kemba the supermax this offseason. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why would players do it? Well, they are no longer as incentivized to go to another team if they can make the same or slightly less amount of money in 2 years as they can in 4 years. Thus, in the long term, they can make more money by staying with the small-market team for another 2 years. If that team still doesn't seem to have a good future once the contract expires, they can leave for another team.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that the Oklahoma City Thunder have traded both Paul George and Russell Westbrook for an entire roster's worth of future 1st round picks and are actively shopping Chris Paul, I think it's safe to say the Thunder are entering **tank mode**. Success will be measured by maintenance of cap space with 'good contracts', flexibility to participate in trades to take on assets, and keeping a balanced mix of good young talent and cheap veterans with leadership on the team so that there will be a running start to playoff contention as soon as they draft their next superstar rather than by the win-loss record and failure to make the playoffs.

&amp;#x200B;

If Presti needs any guidance, he can look at **The Process**, perhaps one of the most audacious and open tank jobs in recent NBA history. Whereas most tanking happens over a period of 1-2 seasons, the 76ers essentially gave up on winning from 2013 to 2017, building up and using draft picks and dredging the D-League (as it was called back then) and undrafted ranks in hopes of finding undervalued talent on ridiculous contracts (often 4 year minimum contracts with unguaranteed salaries a.k.a. ""Hinkie Specials"").

&amp;#x200B;

As such, the NBA cracked down on such audacious and long-term tanking by recently updated the NBA Draft lottery odds. No longer would the team with the worst record receive a 25% chance at the #1 pick - the 3 teams with the worst records would all receive the **same 14% odds for the #1 overall pick**. Essentially, teams not the worst would get better odds than before, with the worst team losing odds. However, the strategy for tanking teams would still remain the same: lose and build up the losses in order to maximize your odds. And NBA teams easily lose games to the bottom of the standings to increase their chances for top picks. Of course, only the very worst teams could realistically tank and leapfrog each other to have the worst records and therefore the best chances for the highest picks. In the 2018–19 season, these would have been the Knicks (17 wins), Cavaliers (19 wins), and Suns (19 wins).

&amp;#x200B;

While I don’t believe any player or coach purposely tries to lose games, I do believe **organizations do not always attempt to win**. It’s the same with any organization and it starts at the top. If management at the top want a certain outcome, they are the ones to best manipulate the people below to achieve said desired outcome. And in the NBA, that means a number of things from holding players out of games (‘injury concerns’) to not signing or dumping players who would otherwise improve your team (‘cap management’) (it’s one thing to do these as a championship contender, but it’s another to do these when you’re one of the very worst teams in the league).

&amp;#x200B;

Look at the worst teams this season: the Knicks traded practically all their serviceable players in a midseason trade. The Cavaliers brought back their best player Kevin Love back from injury in February but still alternated between playing and resting him and even had former starter J.R. Smith removed from the team since November. And the Suns didn’t bother signing a point guard, so they were playing with two rookie 2nd round point guards for nearly the entire season. And the same pattern often follows the teams that gain the best lottery odds in the upcoming draft.

&amp;#x200B;

But not only does this have a tangible effect on team records, but I believe this also has more unseen effects on organizations, coaches, and players. For players, they are giving away one season of the few they play in the NBA for nothing. Sure they get paid, but chances are they aren’t playing as hard as they should knowing the team doesn’t care about winning. And chances are they aren’t developing as much either. The same goes for coaches. And bad coaches I find are all to often retained on bad teams in order to minimize costs as a better coach would cost more. All this I believe creates more indifference within an organization which makes creating a winning culture all the more difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

And yet its these bad organizations who actually receive the prize of the best draft odds for new talent, instead of bad teams that were actually playing hard and trying to win (the 5th worst team by record Hawks being the prime example, although most non-playoff teams outside the bottom 3 were fairly fun to watch) and therefore have slightly better records.

&amp;#x200B;

So what if the NBA had lottery odds so that ***winning actually matters***? Rather than distribute draft pick odds based on the team’s records alone, the NBA could distribute draft pick odds based on the team’s record in relation to the records of the entire league by way of **standard deviation**. Standard deviation helps identify what we expect to be ‘normal’ and consequently 'not normal'. And while we don’t expect all teams to perform the same, there is a range of ‘normalcy’ with which we’d expect teams out to win would perform at.

&amp;#x200B;

With that said, I identified the standard deviation of wins across each of the past 11 seasons. From from the average number of wins per season (usually 41, but not for the lockout season), I subtracted 1.644854 times the standard deviation and took this number to be an expected number of wins for our worst team *(why 1.644854? the number comes from the central limit theorem that states we’d expect about 90% or 27 teams would be within that range. Assuming the 3 teams are a combination of both best and worse I find that to be reasonable, although I’d love to hear from a real statistician a better multiple)*. I then found the teams with the number of wins closest to our expected wins and gave the draft odds based how close they were. If this had done for the past 11 years, we’d have the following draft orders (I posted the new order up to the point where the order remained the same):  [https://i.redd.it/3zi42udg6y931.png](https://i.redd.it/3zi42udg6y931.png).

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, it’s almost always just the team with the worst record that gets bumped (although it would be different depending on the multiple of standard deviation used). And while I’m skeptical of 20/20 hindsight, if we review the history of some of the biggest 'losers' with the proposed system, it's quite evident the teams were not trying to win at all that season:

* [2015–16 Philadelphia 76ers](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/PHI/2016.html): they were probably the straw that broke the camel’s back in creating the new lottery odds as they were terrible from the get-go (8.5 wins behind what standard deviation was expecting!).
* [2014–15 Minnesota Timberwolves](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MIN/2015.html): they were going to be bad after Kevin Love was traded. But they were only 3.2 wins behind our ‘target win’ count. Maybe if they had put in some more effort in their offseason (like, actually trying to find someone who would actually carry the scoring load in place of Love) they would have been a bit more competitive.
* [2013–14 Milwaukee Bucks](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MIL/2014.html): this team was 4 wins worse than a 76ers team that was still part of The Process. The leading scorer was Brandon Knight at 17.9 PPG, followed by Ramon Sessions at 15.8 PPG. (Yep…) But perhaps most telling was that no player on this team was paid more than $8M this season (and that was…O.J. Mayo).
* [2011–12 Charlotte Bobcats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHA/2012.html): this was was 13 wins worse than the next worse team. It actually set the record for worst winning percentage in a season. It’s hard to say that any organization trying to win could have ended up this badly, even with a lockout shortened season. It’s quite possible this team wasn’t even bothering to win games at a certain point knowing it was looking forward to presumed #1 draft pick Anthony Davis (essentially the Zion Williamson of the 2012 draft).
* [2009–10 New Jersey Nets](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/NJN/2010.html): this was that team that started the season 0–16, then fired Lawrence Frank, then fired the interim coach (Tom Barrise), and then put their GM Kiki Vandeweghe as coach for the rest of the season. This was a disaster, and I think that was the plan. One factor? They made zero offseason free agent signings before the start of the season leading them to start a mix of Brook Lopez (fine), Devin Harris (ok), Courtney Lee (ok), Yi Jianlian (and this is where it’s clear there was zero effort put into the roster), Chris Douglas-Roberts, 33 year-old Rafer Alston, Jarvis Hayes, Trenton Hassell, and Josh Boone.

&amp;#x200B;

Please note that while the above teams (and the aforementioned 2018–19 Knicks) would drop a few spots, the actual drop is chances for the best pick with the new lottery odds is closer to 5% **which is hardly game changing**. On the flip side, more competitive teams would gain those few percentage points leading to a number of benefits.

&amp;#x200B;

For one, teams will try to win more and there will be fewer ‘**lost seasons**’. Almost all the cases of ‘lost seasons’, where prior to the season starting everyone from the fans to the owners already have written off the season, are so extreme that the team has a win-loss record that actually causes their lottery odds to drop in our new algorithm.

&amp;#x200B;

This means even when teams know they have no shot at the playoffs, **they will still need to compete**. That means at least trying in the offseason to sign players (albeit I’m sure at reasonable or short term contracts). This also means in better coaching hires and more urgency with getting the right coach. (The coaches for the Bobcats and Bucks teams above were Paul Silas and Larry Drew respectively. Both of them lasted the entire season and neither ever coached again after those seasons. Ownership could have at least cut them during the season to test an assistant coach who would try to win.)

&amp;#x200B;

This means even during the last stretch of games, non-playoff teams will still play to win games at the risk of losing too much and dropping their draft odds. It means we’ll have fewer games like [this](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201504150PHI.html).

&amp;#x200B;

This means more teams who are willing to sign players before and during the season, which is definitely better for the players. It means more urgency in finding better coaches, which is better for everyone from the players to the organizations to the fans. It means better games and more reason to follow their team, even if they aren’t contenders. And perhaps most importantly, **it means organizations are going to start getting in the habit of doing what it takes to win, even though they aren’t going to**.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s easy to say that you can just cobble together your championship team with some splashly free agent signings, but I don’t think that’s true. For one, look at how often a championship team at least made the playoffs in the previous year. The only one I can think of is the 2007–08 Boston Celtics over the past 40 odd years. What I think that implies is championship habits don’t occur over one season. And more so I think that organizations can’t build championship teams until they know how to build playoff teams. And they can’t build playoff teams until they start getting their teams consistently in the playoffs. And they can’t do that hoping a rookie draft pick is going to do it for them. They need to know how to operate in free agency and just reach their goal of building a playoff team that doesn’t break the bank (see 2018–19 Los Angeles Clippers and Brooklyn Nets which despite a lack of stars have managed their cap space well, have made the playoffs, and had enthusiastic fan bases prior to signing their superstars, and poached 4 MVP candidates combined in just a single offseason).

&amp;#x200B;

Too complicated? Maybe, although I think the NBA’s trend toward analytics makes this much more palatable now than say 3 seasons ago. The NBA is finding out now traditional methods were maybe not the most effective methods of performing the same task. And I think the traditional method of ranking draft odds was creating unintentional consequences that are reduced with these new odds.

&amp;#x200B;

The NBA has for the most part tried to help team owners not screw up their teams. Think about the salary cap, maximum contracts, and capped rookie deals. Or the Ted Stepien rule about trading future draft picks. Or the Allan Houston Rule on terminating contracts. I think this new draft order ranking would not only help NBA teams not screw up their organizations, but also indirectly promote the skills to create better organizations and teams by encouraging every team to consistently win.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,60022,public,self,[X-Post] Tanking and A Different Way to Generate NBA Lottery Odds,0,1563121716,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ccr8n8/xpost_tanking_and_a_different_way_to_generate_nba/,,,,,,,,,,

Note: The above chart includes only players who got 5 or more votes. There were a few players that got like one vote that I excluded.

Some notes on the data:

* Please welcome both Blake Griffin and Bradley Beal into the Top 30! Both players missed the cutoff last year, but have managed to claim a spot this time around. Blake especially is notable, going from ""definitely out of the top 30"" to running away with #16.
* Karl-Anthony Towns becomes the first player to not have changed in ranking at all. He was 17 last year, and continues to be so this year.
* Whether it be Boston bias or just a reflection of a standout year, Kemba Walker has risen 11 spots in the rankings, dethroning previous best riser Nikola Jokic by 4!

Once again, a reminder that **this ranking is reflective.** We are primarily basing these rankings off the 2018-2019 season and playoffs and how each player performed specifically during that time.

I'll report back with the results at around the same time tomorrow and continue on to the last five.

I think Gallinari would be a fantastic mid-season addition for a team that is aiming to make a playoff push.

And I think the Portland Trail Blazers could very well be that team. Gallinari would be a great 3rd option next to Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum - he's not a terrible passer, but most importantly, he's a terrific shooter (averaged 19.8pts/6.1reb/2.6ast on 46/43/90 shooting).

As I mentioned before, Gallinari is an expiring, but to a certain extent it's also a good thing, as he doesn't lock up money for the upcoming years - both Danilo Gallinari and Hassan Whiteside would enter enter Unrestricted Free Agency in 2020, a year before C.J. McCollum enters it, thus opening the Blazers more cap flexibility.

Around the end of June, the Trail Blazers traded Evan Turner for Kent Bazemore, thus giving security in case their free agent wings leave, but they managed to re-sign Rodney Hood and also signed Mario Hezonja for the veteran minimum. Could that potentially mean Portland would be open to trading Kent Bazemore along with other assets for the Italian forward?

- - - - -

My suggestion for a Danilo Gallinari trade would be:

Kent Bazemore + Portland's First Round Pick (most likely the upcoming 2020) + Future Second Round Pick for Danilo Gallinari

A Bazemore:Gallinari swap works out financially according to ESPN's Trade Machine and TradeNBA, and the 2 picks are included to sweeten the deal for the OKC to take it.

The 2017-18 Oklahoma City Thunder used Melo as the excuse to their 1st round lost to the Utah Jazz and their poor season overall

Carmelo averaged 16.7 points per game and 5.8 rebounds per game while 36% from the 3pt line on 6 attempts a game

The team got 48 wins and made the playoffs 

Carmelo was practically unable to play in elimination games as Billy Donovan sat out Melo barely letting him play 25 mpg as a starter 

In that game 6 where Carmelo wasn’t play in the clutch Russell Westbrook shot a whole 43 shots and only made 18 of them

Not gonna squeal anything else but Paul George had less points (5 points-2-16 shooting-46mp) than Carmelo on 20+ more minutes of playing time and received no blame for the loss either 

In 2019 the didn’t have Melo who “made the team worse” and only increased their win total by +1 (this is with MVP candidate Paul George)

This team once again lost in the first round

Westbrook averaged 23-11-8 which sounds good except he allowed Damian Lillard to bust his ass oh and he also shot 36% on the series

*Paul George did good so he gets no blame*

It makes it seem more as Russell Westbrook’s short comings of performing bad is what made OKC lose and they had no Melo excuse this year

Now to bring up the 2018-19 Houston Rockets who cut Melo 10 games into the season 

The Rockets started the season off terribly and Melo even sacrificed his role and rode the bench 

Carmelo in 10 games averaged 13.4p and 5.4r on 33% 3pt% on 6 attempts a game 

In his 10 games Melo had 3 20+ point games including 28 off the bench being his season highest

2 games later and he’s cut from the team and it’s just whack at this point

He could very well end up a top 5 player in this draft. But they gave up the 8th and 17th picks in this draft as well as 2nd round picks to get him. A few guys are already showing loads of promise (a few that I’ve predicted as well). I’m going to list some guys they gave up the chance to get in exchange for Hunter. 

1.  Nickeil Alexander-Walker - he’s been killing it in summer league. I’m putting him number one because he was literally drafted with their 17th pick. The guy looks like he could be an all-star and looks to be a rangy guard with some serious athleticism.

2.  Tyler Herro - I was all over this kid after watching him in the NCAA tournament. It was clear Rick Calipari didn’t know how to use him. He didn’t play much off ball and they didn’t screen for him much at all. This is the kind of guy you take as a low risk high reward player especially when you have three first round picks! The worst outcome is he becomes a good 3 and serviceable d player. 

3. Grant Williams - Assuming the Pelicans figured out a way to get Nickeil Alexander - Walker before that 17th pick. Williams is the ideal guy to become a stretch 4 or small ball 5. He’s shown some skills in summer league and the Celtics already love him. He would’ve been a great backup pick at 17. 

4. Jordan bone went to the Pistons at the end of the 2nd round with the pick the hawks dished to the Pels. Jordan Bone is the perfect G-league guy. He had better measurables than Russell Westbrook at the combine. With some work he could be a really scary fast break guy. 

I understand if you’re a team that has a pretty deep roster and you can’t realistically add 3 or 4 young guys without cutting valuable talent. But that wasn’t a problem for the Hawks (they literally just traded for Evan turner to run the backup PG spot). This trade could workout fine for them: Hunter and Reddish could be all stars one day and Fernando could be a starter. But the way I see it is the draft is a crapshoot. They had 5 picks and wound up with 3. By doing that, they decreased their odds of getting multiple long term talents. Especially with all the experts indicating there wasn’t a huge talent gap between picks 4 and 10.

Expecting him to have the same level of impact this season is unrealistic.\n\nMost western teams who are expected to fight for the last few playoff spots have also made massive upgrades. \n\n* Sacramento added a ton of great vets to the roster in Dedmon, Ariza, and Cory Joseph among others. \n\n* New Orleans had a fantastic offseason. \n\n* Minnesota is getting back Robert Covington who was arguably the most impactful perimeter defender in the league last year when healthy and missed every game since New Year's. Their top 3 point guards missed a combined 83 games last year as well and their adding Vonleh and Culver to the mix.\n\n* Spurs are consistently great and are adding DeMarre Carroll and Keldon Johnson as well as a healthy Dejounte Murray to aid their perimeter defense which was their biggest weakness last year. DeRozan is going into year 2 of a Spurs offense that is notoriously difficult to learn.\n\nTeams like the Clippers, Lakers, Nuggets, Jazz, Trail Blazers, and Warriors will be locks for the playoffs next year. Nothing needs to be said about their offseasons. And then the teams expected to be at the bottom have good arguments to be placed over Dallas next year.\n\n* Phoenix added Ricky Rubio, which is actually massive considering they didn't have anyone who knew how to feed the ball to DeAndre Ayton last year. This alone should have a massive impact on Ayton's production and the presence of another ball-handler should help take some pressure off of Book. Add in the fact that he'll help their perimeter defense a ton and there's going to be another year of development for Ayton, Book, and Bridges and they're getting a full season out of Kelly Oubre who was fantastic for them.\n\n* OKC still has a competitive roster. Chris Paul obviously isn't the player he once was but he's still a great player. Danilo Gallinari was a borderline All-Star last yeay, and then Shai and Steven Adams are solid as hell as well. Roberson may be healthy as well, while Nerlens Noel and Dennis Schroder are guys who can be productive off the bench.\n\n* Memphis has a great young duo with Ja and Jaren Jackson and they have Jonas Valanciunas who put up 20/10 while in a Grizz uniform last year.

Here&amp;#39;s a few reasons why I believe this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They went 8-21 after the trade deadline last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Porzinigs hasn&amp;#39;t played since February 2018. Expecting him to have the same level of impact this season is unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most western teams who are expected to fight for the last few playoff spots have also made massive upgrades. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sacramento added a ton of great vets to the roster in Dedmon, Ariza, and Cory Joseph among others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Orleans had a fantastic offseason. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minnesota is getting back Robert Covington who was arguably the most impactful perimeter defender in the league last year when healthy and missed every game since New Year&amp;#39;s. Their top 3 point guards missed a combined 83 games last year as well and their adding Vonleh and Culver to the mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spurs are consistently great and are adding DeMarre Carroll and Keldon Johnson as well as a healthy Dejounte Murray to aid their perimeter defense which was their biggest weakness last year. DeRozan is going into year 2 of a Spurs offense that is notoriously difficult to learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Teams like the Clippers, Lakers, Nuggets, Jazz, Trail Blazers, and Warriors will be locks for the playoffs next year. Nothing needs to be said about their offseasons. And then the teams expected to be at the bottom have good arguments to be placed over Dallas next year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phoenix added Ricky Rubio, which is actually massive considering they didn&amp;#39;t have anyone who knew how to feed the ball to DeAndre Ayton last year. This alone should have a massive impact on Ayton&amp;#39;s production and the presence of another ball-handler should help take some pressure off of Book. Add in the fact that he&amp;#39;ll help their perimeter defense a ton and there&amp;#39;s going to be another year of development for Ayton, Book, and Bridges and they&amp;#39;re getting a full season out of Kelly Oubre who was fantastic for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;OKC still has a competitive roster. Chris Paul obviously isn&amp;#39;t the player he once was but he&amp;#39;s still a great player. Danilo Gallinari was a borderline All-Star last yeay, and then Shai and Steven Adams are solid as hell as well. Roberson may be healthy as well, while Nerlens Noel and Dennis Schroder are guys who can be productive off the bench.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memphis has a great young duo with Ja and Jaren Jackson and they have Jonas Valanciunas who put up 20/10 while in a Grizz uniform last year. They also have a lot of depth and a ton of great role players like Jae Crowder, Kyle Anderson, Tyus Jones, and Andre Igoudala if he stays with the team for a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can anybody tell me why they think Dallas has a realistic shot at the playoffs next year?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'nba', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2qo4s', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/nba', 'subreddit_subscribers': 2512909, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': None, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'thumbnail_height': None, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'title': 'I think people are overestimating the Mavericks', 'total_awards_received': 0, 'ups': 1, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ccl8ex/i_think_people_are_overestimating_the_mavericks/', 'user_reports': [], 'view_count': None, 'visited': False, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}]",,,,,,

There will still be 24 all stars, but each of them will choose 2 players from their own team that are not allstars and make a team of 3 (ex: maybe Harden picks CP3 and Capela). So if a team has multiple all stars, they can't be on the same team and they'll have to draft their own teammates (so like hypothetically LeBron would choose two guys who aren't allstars and AD would choose 2 other guys). So there will be 24 teams.

The fans vote for 8 Allstars; 3 guards, 3 forwards, 2 centers. This can be changed, but this is what works best practically in my opinion. These 8 teams will receive first round byes in the All Star Tournament. 

The remaining 16 allstars will play in the first round and the winners from their respective games will play against the voted in all stars (seeding will be randomized for these 16)

#Format

It is a 32 team bracket, but due to the 8 byes, there will only be 24 teams, and a total of 23 games including the Finals. On All Star Friday, there will be 8 games, between the 16 non-voted in teams. On All Star Saturday, the winners of the Friday games play the voted-in teams, leaving 8 teams going into Sunday. On All-Star Sunday, the last 3 rounds take place (7 games total). So the most games anyone will play is either 4 or 5

The games will be half-court 3-on-3 games up to 21, or a best of 3, and each game is upto 11. I think 1 game upto 21 is more exciting. 

#Prize

Why would this format be any more competive than the all-star game? 1) you're repping your team, and playing with your real teammates, and those guys maybe don't get this opportunity to play on a big stage. There's a greater sense of pride. 2) the prize is a big one. On top of the normal cash prize the NBA gives to the winners, the winning team hosts the next year's All-star Tournament. No more of that long process, if you want it, your players have to earn it. Something real to play for. Getting to host a huge event in your city, especially for small market teams, they will want to put their teams/cities in the spotlight, and it can help with recruiting if they can show that their city is actually fun. 

Admittedly there may be a few problems, like it's short notice, but that's not a huge deal. Also, if the winning players leave/get traded, that would be awkward next year. And the biggest problem you may have is repetitiveness. First of all, since you're not allowed to have more than one allstar, there will be enough parity that it's hopefully not an issue. But even if it is, maybe back-to-back hosts are not allowed, or if anything, cap it at 2 in a row.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,59784,public,self,Potential All-Star Game Replacement Idea,0,1563068902,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ccjpfr/potential_allstar_game_replacement_idea/,,,,,,,,,,

**1) LeBron James -** Elite, MVP level production all the way through 2010-2018, with still a high level of production in 2019.  Could've left the decade with 6 MVPs if it were not for voter fatigue.  Him at #1 isn't very close.

**2) Kevin Durant -** The greatest scorer of the decade, played at an elite, 1st-team all NBA level from 2010-2019.  Many people forget he was MVP runner up to LeBron in 2010 at that point in his young career, and continued elite levels of scoring until then.  While Steph's peak is arguably a little higher, Durant was an elite player from 2010-2014 while Steph was still developing.

**3) Steph Curry -** If we were just taking 2015-2019, might have a valid claim to be above KD and on LeBron's tier for a fight for #1, but Steph didn't have even close to the same impact as KD or LeBron for the first half of the decade.  For his 2 MVPs and historic output in the 2nd half of the decade he still comes in cleanly at 3 without very much bottom competition.

**4) James Harden -** Highly productive bench player in 2010 and 2011, 6th man of the year in 2012, emerged as All-NBA talent in 2013 with his own team in Houston.  Consistently got better, and by 2015, was a NBA MVP contender.  Getting one of his own MVPs in 2018, and 2/3 very close runner up MVP nominations, as well as the 2nd highest scoring output season since MJ averaged 37, warrants him the 4th spot on this list.  Without a historically dominant, overpowered Warriors team in the West 2018-2019, Harden probably sees a couple of finals appearances and maybe a title.

**5) Chris Paul -** Was the best point guard in the league in 2010-2013 until Steph started to take the mantle, but continued to play at an elite 1st/2nd team all NBA level until 2017, while still being an amazing player in 2018.  Fell off a cliff production wise in 2019, but being at the top / near top of the game for 9 / 10 years warrants him the 5th spot.

**6) Russell Westbrook** \- Very close call between Westbrook and CP3 for the 2010s decade.  Westbrook ascended to 2nd team all NBA level by 2011, and maintained that level of production until 2016.  Once KD left, went on to have historic usage rates and had the first of many seasons averaging a triple double, as well as notching a MVP.  While he got an MVP and CP3 didn't, I think CP3's dominance in the beginning of the decade, coupled with the argument that CP3's offense was more efficient and beneficial to team success than Russell's high usage game was from 2016-2018, gives CP3 the slight edge.  Westbrook also similarly fell off a cliff efficiency wise, and to arguably a worse extent, than CP3 did in 2019.

**7) Kawhi Leonard** \- Drafted in 2011, Kawhi developed slower than most players on this list in the Spurs system, but his peak allows him to make the cut at the 7 position.  Kawhi didn't become a serious contributor until the 2013-2014 season, where he won FMVP for his defensive efforts.  He grew into the clear focal point of the Spurs offense in 2015, and Kawhi ascended to 1st-team all NBA caliber, best 2-way player in the league status in 2016.  From 2016-2019, with the exception of his 2017-2018 injury season, Kawhi has been an unequivocal Top 5 player in the league, notching a historic Finals victory in 2019.  He joins LeBron and KD as the only players on the list with multiple FMVPs.  He proved to be an elite player for the latter half of the decade 2016-2019, and was a solid, amazing defensive stopper from 2013-2015.  That's good enough for 7 on this list.

**8) Dwight Howard** \- Very easy to make fun of him now, but his dominance shouldn't be understated.  All NBA first team, MVP, DPOY candidate player from 2010-2012, and remained a TOP all NBA player in his heavily criticized 2013-2014 seasons.  For half the decade, Howard was at the top / near top of the league.  While made fun of at every stop he's been at since the Rockets, he's technically remained a very solid contributor / starting level player on teams since 2015-2019, with greater production than Wade.  I think there's a big drop off between the Top 7 and everyone else, but the debate between Wade and Howard is somewhat close - I think Howard remained excellent and at a higher peak than Wade did from 2010-2014, and actually was a more positive starting level contributor from 2015-2019 than Wade was in the same period, which is why I gave Dwight the nod.  RIP his respect tho, damn near everyone hates him now

**9) Dwayne Wade** \- Wade's prime came largely before the 2010s, occurring in the 2006-2010 era.  A MVP Candidate, elite player in 2010, to a great 2nd option and all-NBA caliber player from 2011-2013, and a solid player in 2014, he fell off a cliff production wise from 2015 onwards.  After skipping around the league to the Bulls and the Cavaliers, Wade still gets the nod at the 9 spot for his role in the early Heat dynasty in the 2010s while staying in the NBA until 2019.

Fighting for the 10 Seed:  ***Dirk Nowitzki, Kobe Bryant, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Blake Griffin, Carmelo Anthony.***  Kobe's title run in 2010 and elite production from 2010-2013 are a major consideration, but he was probably the most net negative player on this list from 2014-2016 and did not play from 2017-2019.  Dirk's 2011 Finals MVP run was arguably equally as impressive, and he managed to play for longer, but Dirk was no longer a serious all-NBA contributor by 2012-2013 and was largely a bench / role player for the whole decade.  I think both could have some form of argument to be over Wade though, it's pretty close.

Anthony Davis has been a 1st-team all NBA player since all the way back in 2014-2015, but with injury in 2016, the tumultuous 2018-2019 season, and no major team success, I didn't feel like he could seriously get the nod either.  While clearly one of the best, if not best big man in the game during that frame, it only equates to 3 1st Team all NBA selections, and no other all NBA selections.

Paul George and Blake Griffin are sleeper picks - while neither seeing outstanding, title-level achievements that many of the other players on this list have seen, both players made 5 All-NBA selections in the 2010s decade - more than anyone on this list outside the top 6 (Kawhi only has 3, Wade only has 4, Kobe has 4, Dirk has 3, AD has 3).  Griffin was a 2nd team all NBA player from 2012-2015, fell into injury issues and relative obscurity, and came back impressively in 2019.  Similarly, Paul George was one of, if not the most promising young player in 2013-2016 with 3 all NBA nods, had a horrendous injury, played well enough in 2017-2018 to get an all NBA nod, and became a darkhorse MVP and DPOY candidate in 2018-2019.  They should be considered fringe Top 10 players, and locks for a Top 15 list in the best players of the 2010s.

I don't think Carmelo's claim for a Top 10 spot is very good, but it's worth mentioning.  Was a fringe All-NBA player from 2010-2013, with one excellent season in 2012-2013 where he stole one first place MVP vote from LeBron in what would have otherwise been the first unanimous MVP season.  He made 3 all NBA teams in that time, and following which became a fairly inefficient player and never saw himself contribute to any meaningful team success after this period.  Even without how much he's been disgraced from 2017-now, he didn't play at any meaningful level from 2014-2016, and his ""peak"" during the decade involved being on a good Nuggets team in 2010, two 1st round exits in 2011-2012, and 1 2nd round exit in 2013 with the Knicks.  I think PG and Blake actually played better for a longer period of time than Carmelo did during this decade (Some of Carmelos best years were in the 2000s)",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,59723,public,self,Top 10 Players of the 2010s (2010-2019 ONLY),0,1563060363,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cci9lz/top_10_players_of_the_2010s_20102019_only/,,,,,,,,,,

When I heard about this signing especially the part where Kawhi started playing GM with teams wanting to sign him something triggered me a bit. 

I don’t think this is a move that NBA teams will want to be propagating. Could you imagine years ago. A player not even on your team making trade demands and mortgaging your teams future for his own needs. And then building his contract to expire right when it blows up in your teams face. 

I guess for the clips desperate for validation and playoff success it is worth the risk. This is bar far their best team. However, they forget that Leonard and George have been both huge injury risks throughout their careers. I will not be surprised of Kawhis leg turns out to be more than tendinopathy.  

They have no backup plan.

I get a players desire to return home, to play for a winning team, to want to play with certain guys, to make the most money, to take care of their families. But being player GM’s (aka LeBron) has not worked out in the past and something I don’t like seeing.

Why every team does it:

OKC: The Thunder, who are pressing the full rebuild button, have no use for a CP3, Gallinari and Adams team to carry them to a best case scenario of a mid 30 win team. The purpose of this trade would be to gain 2 more first round picks and taking a home run swing on if Wiggins can realize a quarter of his potential. OKC gets rid of Adams, who is on a 2-year, 52 million dollar contract, in exchange for a 1-year expiring contract in Parsons and ANOTHER first round pick in 2020 (Nets will likely not fall in the 1-14 range). OKC gives up CP3's horrible contract in exchange for Wiggins' equally horrible contract - people can argue which contract is worse and who should be giving up picks, but to tip the scales Minnesota picks up a more immediately valuable Gallinari expiring contract in exchange for their 2021 first round pick and a weak Jeff Teague expiring contract. **OKC gets ANOTHER 2 first round picks in their war chest and take a swing on Wiggins, setting their team up for a full tank instead of having a weak 3-player core that would be futile in the West. SGA and Wiggins are given full throttle to develop as much as they need as OKC secures a great lottery pick for next year's draft.** ***After doing this,*** ***OKC now has traded for an additional 10 first round picks from 2020-2026 in the 2019 off-season.***

MIN: TWolves aim to make the playoffs and to build a competitive team around KAT with CP3-Culver-Gallinari-Covington-KAT as their ""small-ball"" core, which as long as Culver plays up to his potential, should be a fairly competitive starting line-up immediately. expiring Teague+Wiggins' horrible contract for CP3's horrible contract+expiring Gallinari is, from a basketball perspective, a massive win for the TWolves, and in exchange they have to give up their 2021 first round pick. I believe the TWolves expect to be a competitive team with a still competent CP3, developing Culver and a KAT entering his prime in the 2020-2021 season, and their draft pick should be well outside the Top 10. **Minn goes in for truly competing with a CP3-Gallinari-KAT big 3 core, with Covington and Culver as role pieces. If Gallinari leaves in 2020, hopefully Culver will be ready to pick up the slack as a 3rd wheel in the a CP3-KAT-Culver big 3.**

ATL: Hawks off-load the last year of the infamous Chandler Parsons contract, who won't play a role for a Hawks team that's trying to be competitive, for a game-ready Steven Adams who can be a veteran presence for a strong young core of Trae+Heurter+Hunter+Reddish+Collins, as either Reddish or Hunter come off the bench with Adams being the core center. Given how weak the East is, Adams might be able to push them over the edge. Given they own a potential 3 first round picks in 2020, the Hawks give up the Nets pick they own, still holding their own pick for 2020 in exchange for a very quality center as they try to make the playoffs. **ATL looks to compete for a playoff seed with a well balanced Trae-Heurter-Hunter/Reddish-Collins-Adams core, only giving up the worse of their 2 first round picks in 2020.**

OKC offloads CP3's 3-year contract to Minnesota and Adams' 2-year contract to ATL, while getting back two expiring contracts in Teague and Parsons to be tank generals, while taking a chance on Wiggins developing and getting two additional first round picks.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,59662,public,self,"OKC Thunder Potential FULL Rebuild Trade (Trading Chris Paul, Steven Adams, and Danilo Gallinari in a 3-Team Trade)",0,1563052362,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ccgqbh/okc_thunder_potential_full_rebuild_trade_trading/,,,,,,,,,,

** He played 64 games. Missed : 18 games **

* Out of these 18 games he missed a total of 13 games spanning from November – December due to a “stress reaction to the ankle”.
* Stress Reaction: There are two main causes to this: Mechanical and Functional Instability. Mechanical is due to poor mechanics of the ankle and displaced stress on the ligaments. Functional is due to strength deficits and balance issues.   It could be a combination of both but in AD’s case I believe it is due to functional instability. He had a big growth spurt in his earlier years which is tough on younger players as they are not accustomed to their own bodies not to mention this was his rookie year in the NBA playing against grown men. 
* After that stretch he missed two games in regular season and the last three of the season. 

# # # # # #  2013 – 2014 Season:

** He played 67 games. Missed : 15 games **

* 7 games due to non – displaced fracture in his left hand while taking a charge. This was just a freak accident and AD came back to finish the season strong. After missing the playoffs he didn’t play the last 5 games of the season.
* He missed couple of other games during the season but they took him out due to precaution. 


# # # # # # 2014 – 2015 Season:

** He played 68 games. Missed 14 games** 

* Missed 7 games during February – March due to a shoulder injury from Alley-Oop. The first game after he returned he recorded stunning 39 points, 13 rebounds, 8 blocks (only Hakeem and Dwight have ever put up those numbers).
* That playoffs he averages 31 Points, 11 Rebounds, and 3 Blocks before getting swept by the GSW.


# # # # # # 2015 – 2016 Season:

** He played 61 games. Missed whooping 21 games! **

* Season Ending Injury: left knee injury and a torn labrum in his left shoulder (which he claims has been bothering him since his rookie year).  Take a look at this article if you want a more in [depth review of the injury](http://instreetclothes.com/2016/03/23/examining-injuries-anthony-davis/)

[Trade 1 - CP3 to Dallas](http://tradenba.com/trades/S1I8HBLZr)

**[OKC sends]:** CP3 and a lottery protected 2023 MIA 1st round pick

**[DAL sends]:** Courtney Lee and Tim Hardaway JR  

Dallas gets a solid PG for their young core while also getting a 1st round pick back. Seeing as their assets are a little low from all the trading they've been doing, I think they would gladly take on CP3s contract while getting a 1st back. OKC sheds CP3s contract and gets an expiring in Lee and an expiring the year after in Hardaway JR while only giving up their worst future 1st. 

[Trade 2 - CP3 to Miami](http://tradenba.com/trades/HyfJB0BZS)

**[OKC sends]:** CP3 

**[MIA sends]:** Goran Dragic and Dion Waiters

Miami becomes a contender in the east pairing CP3 up with James Butler while only having to give up a disgruntled Dragic and an out of shape Waiters. OKC gets an expiring this year and an expiring the year after.

[Trade 3 - CP3 to Minnesota](http://tradenba.com/trades/rJdBTTBZH)

**[OKC sends]:** CP3

**[MIN sends]:** Jeff Teague, Gorgie Dieng 

The Timberwolves hopes the addition of CP3 makes them a playoff lock and is a good influence on the development of KAT. OKC gets an expiring in Teague and one next year in Dieng. 

[Trade 4 - CP3 to Washington](http://tradenba.com/trades/H1XN3SLbB)

**[OKC sends]:** CP3

**[WAS sends]:** John Wall, 2022 top 3 protected 1st, 2024 top 4 protected 1st and a 2025 1st round swap option

The most unlikely trade in this post in my opinion, but maybe Washington thinks they can be a contender if they pair CP3 with Beal. OKC takes on Walls contract for Two future 1st and a pick swap in 2025. Doubt this happens. 

**The following trades will happen after December 15th if OKC holds onto CP3 for the beginning of the season:**

[Trade 5 - CP3 to Milwaukee](http://tradenba.com/trades/HJm_c7LZS)

**[OKC sends]:** CP3

**[MIL sends]:** Eric Bledsoe, George Hill and Ersan Ilyasova

Doubt either side does this trade, but if theres no market for CP3 up until this point, and MIL wants to added a solid player to play with Giannis, I could see them dumping these 3 guys. Unlikely though. 

[Trade 6 - CP3 to Orlando](http://tradenba.com/trades/H1_uouH-S)

**[OKC sends]:** CP3

**[ORL sends]:** Evan fournier, Fultz and DJ Augustin

Orlando does this trade if their hovering around the 6th-8th seed range and wanna make a push to see if they can do something in the playoffs pairing CP3 with Gordon and Vucevic. By this time Fultz hasn't shown any promise and the market for CP3 isn't big so they take a swing. OKC gets a prospect in Fultz and an expiring in DJ. 

[Trade 7 - CP3 to Detroit](http://tradenba.com/trades/H1ilsrUZr)

**[OKC sends]:** CP3

**[DET sends]:** Reggie Jackson, Tony Snell and Khyri Thomas

They had a big offseason after losing KD to injury, only to lose him again to the Nets in FA. Personally I think this is a blessing in disguise for the Warriors, as there is no guarantee KD comes back to his former glory. The Warriors also received talented young All-Star D’Angelo Russell at the cost of a future first round pick. 


This being said, how many games do you think the Warriors will win this year?


Obviously there are several factors that play into their overall record and chemistry.  

When will Klay Thompson return from his ACL tear? 

What is D’Angelo Russell’s fit in the backcourt? 


After analyzing their roster myself, I turned to the power of Google to see what other, more intelligent people had projected for their season. I found an article from a CBS News NBA Projection [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-title-odds-2020-predictions-picks-teams-to-avoid-from-advanced-computer-model/amp/): the Golden State Warriors are 12:1 in odds to win the title, tied with the Houston Rockets according to CBS/Sportline(?)

(Note: This has NOT been updated to include the Westbrook trade.)

My personal belief is that the Warriors are a lock for the playoffs as their roster stands.

 I do think Thompson will return to previous form after his injury, and may even be back in 8 months. 

Russell and Curry will fit better than they do on paper.

Draymond will step his game up for his contract year. 

I think as currently built, the Warriors regular season record will be 51-31 and they will make the Western Conference Finals before losing to the LA Clippers.

Hey everyone, welcome back to the (un)official reddit player rankings of the 2019 offseason.

Last time, y'all voted for the top 11~15 players of the NBA. Here are the results after compiling 150+ responses:

Player | Team | Pos | 6th Votes | 7th Votes | 8th Votes | 9th Votes | 10th Votes | Points
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
Damian Lillard | [POR](/POR) | PG | 105 | 30 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 659
Kyrie Irving | [BKN](/BKN) | PG | 20 | 28 | 28 | 22 | 11 | 351
Russell Westbrook | [HOU](/HOU) | PG | 7 | 20 | 38 | 27 | 17 | 300
Jimmy Butler | [MIA](/MIA) | SF/SG | 2 | 14 | 20 | 18 | 9 | 171
Klay Thompson | [GSW](/GSW) | SG/SF | 5 | 17 | 12 | 12 | 15 | 168
Karl-Anthony Towns | [MIN](/MIN) | C | 3 | 10 | 18 | 17 | 24 | 167
Rudy Gobert | [UTA](/UTA) | C | 0 | 14 | 5 | 17 | 24 | 129
Blake Griffin | [DET](/DET) | PF/C | 0 | 8 | 11 | 15 | 16 | 111
Bradley Beal | [WAS](/WAS) | SG/SF | 1 | 6 | 8 | 6 | 10 | 75
Kemba Walker | [BOS](/BOS) | PG | 3 | 2 | 9 | 9 | 7 | 75
Kyle Lowry | [TOR](/TOR) | PG | 4 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 47
Ben Simmons | [PHI](/PHI) | PG | 4 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 8 | 39
Luka Doncic | [DAL](/DAL) | SF/SG | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 15


Note: The above chart includes only players who got 5 or more votes. There were a few players that got like one vote that I excluded.

Some notes on the data:

* Logo Lillard runs away with 11th place! His electric playoff performance definitely paid off.
* Things got really close in the end between Jimmy Butler, Klay Thompson, and Karl-Anthony Towns. At one point, they were all tied for 14th. Eventually, Butler pulled away. Klay and KAT got really dicey — and eventually Klay nudged out KAT by only ONE point.
* Jimmy Butler is the second highest-ranked All-Star, after Anthony Davis.
* Russell Westbrook suffered a huge drop in ranking, understandably so after his disappointing season and playoffs.

Today, we'll move onto vote for the top 16-20 players in the NBA. Follow this link and fill out the form to vote: https://forms.gle/17v4oPz8Ps1YGhDX7

Once again, a reminder that **this ranking is reflective.** We are primarily basing these rankings off the 2018-2019 season and playoffs and how each player performed specifically during that time.

I'll report back with the results at around the same time tomorrow and continue on to the top 25.

Thank you for your participation!

They went from one of the fastest teams in the league for most of D'Antoni's early tenure to at one point the second slowest team in the league after the 2018 all star break. And D'Antoni wasnt even necessarily happy about it:

paceby Gavriel Wilkins67w ago

After being known primarily as an up-tempo offensive team for over the last several years, the Houston Rockets have found themselves a new gear during the second half of the regular season, as the team with the best record in basketball is currently playing at a much slower pace.

Over the last five and a half seasons, the Houston Rockets have proven to be one of the game’s most relentless squadswhen it comes to pushing the tempo on offense, seeking to hoist up quick shots from anywhere on the floor against unsettled defenses.

Applying a high-octane attack to dismantle opposing teams in seven seconds or less, the franchise that has never finished lower than seventh in pace since the start of the James Harden era has now found a way to win games by surprisingly playing a slower brand of basketball.

Houston — which has won 19 out of its last 20 games by an average margin of 13.1 points per contest — is playing at the second-slowest pace in the league per NBA.com, averaging just 97.80 possessions per 48 minutes since the start of February. The Rockets have managed to drop five spots overall during that time span, as they currently sit outside the top 10 in pace for the first time since the 2011-12 regular season.

Last week, head coach Mike D’Antonishared his thoughts about Clutch City’s newfound pace and play with Jonathan Feigen of the Houston Chronicle: 
  
“We’d like to play a little faster,” D’Antoni said. “We’ll talk about it. We need to get it up there. We’re turning into a defensive team and it’s really ticking me off.
  
“I can’t speed them up. Every great player has his own speed. That’s how we play.  We try to inch it up a little bit, but Chris Paul is going to play like Chris Paul. He’s a Hall of Fame player. Why change it? James is going to be James. There’ll be times where we push it and times when we don’t. You just get a feel for how you want to play and you do it.”
  
So basically there D'Antoni is admitting that the CP3 era wasnt how he wanted to play, but he went with it to placate Chris. In terms of what we saw the last two years, yes, Chris is an infinitely better fit. The constant isos were something Chris was a master at. But the original D'Antoni system is about getting downhill and then kicking out if the defense collapses. The PnR spam version of the D'Antoni offense is perfect for Russ, the ISO Morey version we got the last two years is not. 
  
Also, in terms of the difference it shooting, while clear that Paul is miles better, D'Antoni's offense has always had negative shooters that they still asked to shoot. A guy like Shawn Marion shot way below league average every year. D'Antoni will have to help Russell with shot selection but it's a requirement that you be a knock-out shooter. IMO for D'Antoni's system, Russ' skillset works as a guy with the athleticism to catch lobs, run in transition while also being able to make every angle pass on the PnR. It really just comes down to buy in on his part to get rid of the bad habits and move as the system requires. But every when we talk about Paul ""fitting into D'Antoni's system"", he really didn't. D'Antoni just changed the system to fit him instead.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,59596,public,self,"CP3 was a perfect fit for Morey Ball, Russ is better fit for D'Antoni ball.",0,1563029027,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ccbqnh/cp3_was_a_perfect_fit_for_morey_ball_russ_is/,,,,,,,,,,

And I'm not even going to suggest splitting the possessions equally between them

The last couple seasons, MDA has staggered Hardens and CP3's minutes to give Chris some time with the ball, but when they shared the floor, it was usually Harden holding the dribble, occasionally taking turns with Chris to keep things interesting.

I think they should 180 that philosophy. I feel Westbrook should get the ball almost the whole time he is on the floor. It may involve taking him off the floor in clutch time or at the end of quarters if he can't let Harden hold it when it's ISO-time; but pretty much all the rest of the time, I think he needs to get it quickly (in the off-chance someone other than him gets a defensive rebound) and push. Then Harden can mosey on down the court behind the fast break and wait around 30 feet away from the rim, drawing his man out of the play and just being ready to get a shot off. Maybe even make a few cuts if he is feeling frisky. Houston can stretch the living bejeezus out of the floor for Russ when their small ball lineup is on (way more space than he ever had to work with in OKC), and Capela surely won't have an issue adjusting to Westbrook's lobs. 

This strategy plays to the strength of the Rockets' personnel and how they conform to Moreyball.

Russ is not great at 3's. Russ ***is*** great at driving. He is better than James. So he should have that weapon in his arsenal whenever he is on the floor. The last thing Houston needs is to relegate him to being a spot-up shooter (like CP3 was).

Harden has to give up the ball (with the exception of when clock management becomes an issue) and just trust his old buddy Westbrook to run the offense.

Obviously if the pace slows down in the half-court, or if Russ ever actually displays signs of fatigue then Harden can get some alone time with Spalding; but overall, give it to the guy who has been ""doing more with less"" *^(est. 2017)* for a while and see what he can do with more.

Now tell me... Aside from how insane it sounds to take the ball out of Harden's hands...

By joining the Golden State Warriors, KD ostensibly eschewed traditions of competitive integrity and joined the team that gave him the best opportunity to win. Some may ask, “Isn’t that just the same thing LeBron did?” and I would agree, but for a number of reasons (‘GSW knocked KD out of the playoffs’, ‘Miami didn’t retain its 06 championship core’) KD’s move was degrees of magnitude more disruptive.

Kawhi, Vince Carter, Alonzo Mourning, and Wilt Chamberlain also all set enormous precedent by demanding player agency while under contract, but KD’s decision to go to Oakland affected the balance of the entire league. Now behavior that those *real competitors* of the 90s revile as ‘soft’ has become the norm. Star players are calling each other to build super teams across the league and front offices are acquiescing because the new competitive landscape rewards teams that strategically acquire assets and cap space. 

In all likelihood, the era of dynasties is over. Players are no longer content to toil for a frugal front office while one player or team dominates the league year after year. With the size of NBA contracts and the potential for endorsement money, these guys can make risky financial decisions to take their shot at the title. And as far as I can imagine, seeing these players develop chemistry and mesh styles and adapt their game will only continue to improve the quality of sport as a whole.

They need a PG and that's why they were rumored to be interested in Russell Westbrook. The Mavericks?

OKC - gets out of CP3's long term contract, gets Hardaway (20mil, 18mil in 20/21) &amp; Lee (1yr/12mil) which saves them approx 6 million in salary and gets them under the luxury cap.

Kevin Durant is a great player and an all-time scorer, but his durability is questionable. In my opinion, he has been lucky not to have suffered a major leg injury before this playoffs. Durant is both tall (probably 7'0) and skinny, which makes his  body incredibly fragile and his legs in particular. As a star player who logs over 2000 minutes each year and makes deep playoff runs, increasing his weight, and his leg strength in particular, should've been a priority for him each offseason. If durability can be a question for somebody like Joel Embiid who is heavier and plays less minutes, it should have been a problem for Durant as well. I'm no biologist but consistent pressure on the legs is going to result in an injury like an Achilles before long, especially when he is playing centre in a lot of Golden State's lineups and then chasing more versatile and athletic players in others.

If he is smart he will work on this as he recovers, otherwise he may suffer a lot of further injury issues like Derrick Rose and the Nets super-team will blow out as a massive failure.

Who will they sign, trade, and waive? We need answers. The Thunder have a plethora of picks, so we'll see what happens in years to come.

After seeing that Oklahoma City Thunder and Houston Rockets traded each other some awful contract with the Thunder getting some juicy picks down the line, it officially turned Oklahoma City Thunder to a tanking team. This makes Chris Paul a not so useful player for the Thunder's tanking plan.

&amp;#x200B;

So instead of eating up minutes for Shai Gilgeous Alexander in the ball handler or point guard spot it would be wise for Chris Paul to be either traded or waived. But it got me to think, ""could Oklahoma City Thunder waive Chris Paul's contract?""

  
I know Chris Paul's contract isn't a super max and the title ask about waiving a super max contract but is it possible for other super max contract to be waived? And does waiving it mean that it should be stretched for many years? I'm sorry for asking this, I am not well knowledge about waiving contracts.

I’m just recalling a discussion on twitter right after the kawhi trade and free agency calmed down where trill withers, a NBA twitter head, was talking about how it’s incredible that there is no market for Russell Westbrook. Teams like Orlando and Detroit have fan bases that are barfing at the idea of their team trading for him. Obviously it’s known he most likely won’t win you a championship, but as it stands right now for these teams is a championship even an option? Like saving all this cap space for who? The Knicks just flopped on one of the greatest free agency classes ever and saving this cap space is gunna land them free agents over the Knicks? Detroit got ran out of the first round by the Bucks and obviously don’t have a point guard. Is it really that bad to go out and get a top 10ish point guard in the league for the next 2 or 3 years to pair with Blake and play for the second round and run some of the top teams for their money? As a fan that would be extremely exciting compared to the alternative of playing it safe and sweating for the 8 seed just to get knocked out immediately and pray your draft picks somehow turn into stars.

Boogie is another example, he still has to prove he’s 100% but he can lead a team in the east at 100% to some competitive playoff runs. I’m just curious as most teams seem to be stuck in purgatory until they get a 1 in a 100000 player like Giannis out of the draft and he was 15 not even a good pick. Putting people in seats and having competitive basketball just seems to be way more fun than waiting around 25 years til you get a star player (that apparently now is just gunna leave after the first deal) 

I know grizzlies fans rave about the grit and grind era how it was probably the most fun they’ve had watching basketball and they didn’t win anything. The mid 2000s Suns with Nash never made it outta the West and they were extremely fun with one of the best offenses

Media figures such as Bill Simmons have gone as far as saying it’s possibly the second worst in the league. At first glance, it’s not an outrageous claim. Russ turns 31 in November, and is due $47 million in his age 34 season (yes, he will be picking up that Player Option). However, as we know, most NBA superstars are underpaid in their prime. Russ may be on the tail end of his own prime, but does the value surplus he provides now exceed the coming deficit during decline?

FiveThirtyEight recently published [this](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-nba-free-agents-got-paid-too-much-and-too-little/) article examining the best bargains and biggest overpays of the NBA’s 2019 free agency class. In their analysis, they assign a market value for next season using their proprietary CARMELO player projection model, and then compare that dollar amount to the player’s actual salary in 2019–20. This is great, but what about beyond this coming season? We can dig deeper.

# What is CARMELO?

I’ll let the people who created it tell you.

*FiveThirtyEight’s Career-Arc Regression Model Estimator with Local Optimization (CARMELO) is a system that forecasts a player‘s future performance. Wins above replacement projections are based on a combination of regular-season and playoff performances. The similarity score is an index measuring how comparable one player is to another, scaled such that a score of zero is average similarity and 100 is the highest possible degree of similarity. Plus-minus is derived from Box Plus/Minus, a measure of the number of points per 100 possessions that a player contributed to his team, relative to an average NBA player. All player ages are as of Feb. 1, 2020.*

When you plug a player into CARMELO, you get a nice graph showing their projected Wins Above Replacement (WAR) with a 90% confidence interval, a player category (for Russ it’s “MVP candidate”), and a 5-year projected Market Value. Below that is a table full of data, including year-by-year numbers for Plus/Minus, WAR, and Market Value.

The metric doesn’t always match conventional wisdom or the eye test (Klay Thompson is an average starter according to CARMELO). However, I do trust that FiveThirtyEight is a lot closer to a player’s true market value than any back-of-a-napkin calculations I could do myself.

# Analyzing Westbrook’s Value

According to CARMELO, Westbrook’s value over the remaining seasons of his current contract are as follows:

* 2019–20: $64.8m (Salary: $38.5m)
* 2020–21: $55.8m (Salary: $41.4m)
* 2021–22: $43.3m (Salary: $44.2m)
* 2022–23: $39.8m (Salary: $47.1m)

As we can see, Russell Westbrook is paid significantly below his market value for the first two years of his contract, accruing a surplus of $40.7 million for his team. After that, his value tapers off, and the final two years of the contract have a deficit of $8.2 million.

Conclusion? Russell Westbrook, despite his gargantuan contract, is projected to provide a net surplus of $32.5 million to his team over the course of his contract. That’s not to say that it’s a great deal — especially if he suffers a serious injury. But, for a team that wants to go all in, future be damned, maybe it’s not such a bad move to take on Westbrook.

# What about John Wall?

It’s consensus that Wizards PG John Wall’s contract is the worst in the league. He tore his Achilles in February, and might miss all of next season. Funnily enough, next season is when his 4-year max extension kicks in. Yikes.

I’ll be (extremely) generous and assume Wall will make a miraculous recovery, play 25 or so games, and have a roughly equivalent value to his injury-shortened year last year where he played 32 games. I’m sorry to inform Wizards fans that, even with my generosity and CARMELO’s bullish projection, John Wall’s contract is in fact very bad. Value vs Salary:

* 2019–20: $4.2m (Salary: $38.2m)
* 2020–21: $16.0m (Salary: $41.3m)
* 2021–22: $13.0m (Salary: $44.3m)
* 2022–23: $7.6m (Salary: $47.4m)

This contract has a net deficit of $130.4 million. For comparison, CARMELO projects Devin Booker to be worth $134.7 million over the same time period. Let me be clear: over the next four years, John Wall will be one (1) Devin Booker less valuable than his salary (and that’s an optimistic estimate).
Is there a worse contract than this in the league? Well…

No, not even close.

# KD is out next season. What about his contract?

Kevin Durant signed a 4 year max with the Brooklyn Nets this summer, but will spend the first year of it on the sidelines recovering from an Achilles tear (hey there, John Wall). Therefore, one might expect that his contract is an Albatross like Wall’s:

* 2019–20: $0m (Salary: $37.2m)
* 2020–21: $51.6m (Salary: $39.1m)
* 2021–22: $44.7m (Salary: $41.0m)
* 2022–23: $35.4m (Salary: $42.9m)
* Total Deficit: $28.5 Million

Well, it’s not nearly as bad. When he’s able to play, Durant will actually be underpaid by $8.2 million according to CARMELO. There are two reasons the Nets gave this contract to Durant — one, for those two seasons of expected surplus where they’ll be top title contenders, and two, to secure Kyrie Irving’s signing. Let’s add Kyrie to the mix:

* 2019–20: $53.8m (Salary: $67.9m)
* 2020–21: $104.2m (Salary: $71.4m)
* 2021–22: $91.9m (Salary: $74.9m)
* 2022–23: $78.4m (Salary: $79.4m)
* Total Surplus: $34.7 Million

This analysis that includes Kyrie helps us better understand why the Nets were willing to offer Durant this contract. Over the next four years, the pair of Kyrie and KD projects to produce a significant surplus.

# Conclusions

* Russell Westbrook is on a “buy-now” contract — rebuilding teams stay away, but contenders and wannabes might find it worth the risk at the margin.
* John Wall’s contract is as awful as everyone thinks.
* Tobias Harris and Khris Middleton’s deals aren’t great either.
* KD and Kyrie are a great deal, even with a lost season.
* Superstars are severely underpaid in this league.

While this analysis is far from perfect (opportunity cost and the effects of the price ceiling that is the max contract aren’t really accounted for), breaking down player signings into a straightforward cost-benefit analysis provides another lens through which to view the NBA’s contract market.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,59447,public,self,"How Bad is Russell Westbrook’s Contract, Really?

I think he get's a lot of undeserved hate despite being extremely talented, so I probably over rate him a bit. Obviously he has his flaws, the most predominant of which is that he is a PG who cannot, and will not shoot. In the halfcourt in the playoffs he can be a liability against teams with multiple defensive mobile big men, and a lot of the time he operates as a PF who's main jobs are cutting and crashing the boards. This happened multiple times against Boston last year and Toronto this year. This negates his offensive potential and severely limits him in Philadelphia. In my opinion, Ben Simmons operates best when he can post up and operate freely in the lane, which he doesn't really have the opportunity to do since Embiid is most effective in the post. With all of this being said, if he develops even a below average jumper, then all of these issues go away, however that is a pretty big if. If, hypothetically Sixers management does not believe that he will ever be an outside shooter, then one of the best options may be to trade him as he does have extremely high value. Here is the trade that I am proposing, who says no?

**SACRAMENTO RECEIVES:**
*Ben Simmons
*Jonah Bolden

**PHILADELPHIA RECEIVES:**
*De'Aaron Fox
*Buddy Hield
*Sacramento 2020 First Round Pick (Lottery Protected)

**Why Sacramento Does the Deal:**
Sacramento recieves a player who is currently better than any player on their roster and has higher upside. With their team they can surround him with shooters like the Bucks do with Giannis. They already have a 3&amp;D center in Dedmon who fits Simmons play style better. The Kings can build around a strong young core of Simmons and Bagley

**Why Philadelphia Does the Deal:**
This deal get's rid of the issue's that Embiid and Simmons have had the past 2 years in the playoffs, and gives Embiid a more traditional PG who he can run the Pick and Roll with. Fox is also an above average shooter who will help to space the floor while Embiid operates in the post. Adding Buddy Hield is also great as he is a fantastic shooter and would probably start over Richardson.

[Here is an interactive version of the plot.](https://aka09.github.io/salary_bpm_col.html)

As you hover over points, you can get information about this player: name, OBPM, DBPM, total BPM, 2018-19, and expected BPM based on salary. You can also zoom in to a particular area of the plot by left-clicking and drawing a square with your cursor. 

**A few notes:**
***
* The size of each point represents the player's salary in 2018-19.
* The color represents how the player performed (measured by BPM) relative to expectations based on salary. In short, blue means that the player's BPM is higher than we would expect based on their salary - i.e. their contract is a good value for the money. Red means the opposite: given their salary, the player's BPM is lower than expected.
* For those who are familiar with statistical modeling: the ""expected BPM"" is simply a prediction based on a linear regression model with salary as the only independent variable. 
* Only players with 500+ minutes are represented in this graph. 
* Some players appear twice because they were bought out, waived, and then signed a new contract (usually for much less than their original contract).

Overall, the best value contracts are for superstars (Giannis, Harden, Davis) or young rising stars who have exceeded expectations (Siakam, Harrell, Looney).

Note: The above chart includes only players who got 5 or more votes. There were a few players that got like one vote that I excluded.

Some notes on the data:

* James Harden is the clear-cut #6 here.
* Same can be said for Anthony Davis, who was more than a 100 points ahead of Nikola Jokic for 7th.
* Speaking of Jokic, he had a career year and the rankings reflect it: he went up 7(!) in the standings, the most of anybody so far.
* Both LA duos feature two top-10 players. The Clippers have #1 and #10, and the Lakers have #2 and #7.

Once again, a reminder that **this ranking is reflective.** We are primarily basing these rankings off the 2018-2019 season and playoffs and how each player performed specifically during that time.

I'll report back with the results at around the same time tomorrow and continue on to the top 20.

TL;DR (but read the whole thing): Overtraining is a growing problem across youth sports. Youth basketball players are spending more time than ever training and playing games, causing their bodies to break down before they even reach college, much less the NBA.

Interesting stats:

* ""In 2017-18, the number of NBA games lost to injury or illness surpassed the 5,000 mark for the first time since the league stopped using the injured reserve list prior to the 2005-06 campaign... This past season, in 2018-19, the league topped the 5,000 mark again.""
* ""In 2017-18, players who had been named to multiple All-Star teams missed an average of 14.63 games due to injury... That figure jumped this past season to 17.02.""
* Not basketball related, but pertains to early specialization in youth sports: ""...at four prestigious national tournaments for elite tennis players ages 12-18, players who played more than four matches -- often at least one per day over a span of four consecutive days -- were more than twice as likely to pull out of the tournament before their fifth match for medical reasons than those who didn't advance that far.""

Questions I have:

* What does this mean for the G league? What's the balance between offering young players a professional workout regimen and not overworking their bodies? Will the balance in the G league be better than in college?
* For all the talk of load management this year, will we see the same principles trickle down to lower levels of basketball?
* Basketball is nearly ubiquitously seen as the safer alternative (at least health-wise) to football as far as major sports go, but where's the line? How many cumulative games missed per year are we willing to tolerate before the apparent quality of the league goes down?",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,59378,public,self,Interesting read from ESPN on the rate of injury for young players entering college and the NBA,0,1562942059,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cbwa6p/interesting_read_from_espn_on_the_rate_of_injury/,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '0yE7S8FSsGjkdhiicK2z2VGn-H9bFMkvowqJgfKOnMo', 'resolutions': [{'height': 60, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/G0llGSM8Zj5OGm3dTwj-NPJPCJaxxbiCH_PmzHgc0_s.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2e61e829d3bc04191f14664d5f345bd39eb4bbb', 'width': 108}, {'height': 121, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/G0llGSM8Zj5OGm3dTwj-NPJPCJaxxbiCH_PmzHgc0_s.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=698ae24709f0c9d1bffa386b6de48f6b942ec644', 'width': 216}, {'height': 180, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/G0llGSM8Zj5OGm3dTwj-NPJPCJaxxbiCH_PmzHgc0_s.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad91a70f1ce438a4a0eb9e120c045364004bb36e', 'width': 320}, {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/G0llGSM8Zj5OGm3dTwj-NPJPCJaxxbiCH_PmzHgc0_s.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5af1b1f82c0835b10c91737d2ed684210539fa98', 'width': 640}, {'height': 540, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/G0llGSM8Zj5OGm3dTwj-NPJPCJaxxbiCH_PmzHgc0_s.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8abbca2bd412b54a0910854b80c87226d960a10', 'width': 960}, {'height': 607, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/G0llGSM8Zj5OGm3dTwj-NPJPCJaxxbiCH_PmzHgc0_s.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3dd2d5a6d88f0d56ed17d43d8b45ee51ccd3e12', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 729, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/G0llGSM8Zj5OGm3dTwj-NPJPCJaxxbiCH_PmzHgc0_s.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=45add56b8ce21d783b87feaa13cef2191d03dc60', 'width': 1296}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

This offseason, they re-signed Khris Middleton to a 5-year maximum deal, as well as Lopez to about 13 million dollars per year, and Hill is making around 10 million dollars annually. They also gave Bledsoe a 70 million-dollar deal for 4 years in March, which is around 18 million dollars per season.

&amp;#x200B;

So, 4 of their players are making around 76 million dollars for the next 3 years, so that likely means they won't have cap space to make any big moves until 2021, and that's when they have to re-sign Giannis to a new deal. We've seen in the past years how players are not afraid to leave their current team for another one in a better situation. So, if the Bucks aren't able to win in the next 2 seasons, and Giannis sees a franchise with maybe a similar roster with more cap flexibility, there's a chance they lose on him.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, of course, they have a pretty competitive roster that nearly made the finals last year, and the team that beat them just lost their superstar and got no replacements in return. But, still, they lost Brogdon in free-agency, and you can argue that their signings this offseason are only going to regress. Middleton didn't even deserve a max contract right now, and it really seems that his peak is going to last for like the next 2 years. Both Hill and Lopez are over 30 years old, Bledsoe is 29 coming out of his best season and a scenario in which he declines for the next seasons is likely.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I overreacting? For me it feels like they are going to be desperate in the next 2 years in a effort to keep Giannis.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,59358,public,self,"Are the Bucks in a desperate ""win-now"" mode?",0,1562932943,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cbux9u/are_the_bucks_in_a_desperate_winnow_mode/,,,,,,,,,,

OKC receives: A Wiggins, T Snell, L Kennard, '22 Pistons first rounder, '21 Clippers second rounder, via DET, '23 Pistons first rounder, '23 Timberwolves first rounder, '24 Timberwolves second rounder

Why OKC does this: OKC seems to be committed to a rebuild, so trading Westbrook seems to be the best option. In this transaction, the Thunder acquire Wiggins, Tony Snell, Luke Kennard and an array of picks. Kennard has shown flashes of being a starting guard and may be able to be a good piece in the rebuild where he will receive additional playing time. Wiggins can be given an opportunity to show he is not yet a bust in new scenery, and if worst turns to worst Wiggins can lead the tank for OKC. Snell is included in the transaction mainly for salary matching purposes but he can potentially be traded to a contender at the deadline for an asset. The Pistons picks can be valuable as they are when Westbrook and Griffin will be declining. The second rounders sweeten the deal for the Thunder, who get a decent haul back for their franchise player despite his large contract and age concerns. OKC also lose out on an injured defensive role player, who I personally do not see helping the team in any capacity. 

&amp;#x200B;

DET sends: T Snell, L Kennard, R Jackson, '22 first rounder, 21' LAC second rounder, '23 first rounder

DET receives: R Westbrook

Why DET does this: Detroit as currently constructed have an aging core who at best will get to the second round this season. In this transaction, they acquire Westbrook, a top 15 player who will form a big three with Griffin and Drummond. This will get the most out of Griffin and in the east, this team being able to get to the conference finals is definitely a possibility. The risk is that if the team fails in the first two years the Pistons can be stuck without picks paying Westbrook and Griffin large amounts of money, however, I think it is a very real possibility the Pistons do this as Westbrook will attract fans and jersey sales  being a big name player and having a 1-2 year contending window is better than being stuck in mediocracy for 4.

MIN sends: A Wiggins, '23 first rounder, '24 second rounder

What’s more, both have roster imbalances that this trade could resolve. 

The trade:

Spurs Receive:

Aaron Gordon
Wesley Iwundu

Magic Receive:

Derrick White
Patty Mills
Jakob Poetl 
Spurs 2020 1st pick

Why the Magic do it:

Until last season Aaron Gordon was the best thing going for this franchise. Young, athletic, and not quite good enough to stop the tank show. Then last season Vucevic took a leap and the team made the playoffs. This clearly has shifted the front offfice into win-now mode, because they re-signed Vucevic &amp; Terrence Ross and took their team over the cap. Unfortunately, adding Aminu to this roster is not going to be enough to comfortably reach the playoffs, let alone contend. 

What’s more, despite the wealth of forwards and bigs, this team still doesn’t have a PG better than Augustin.  Between Isaac, Bamba, Aminu, Iwundu, and newly drafted Okeke, this team has more y’all guys than the can play, and can afford to cash in one or two to get a point guard. By trading Gordon, they’re potentially selling high on a player who’s game may never develop into a significant contributor for a playoff team, and getting below the cap. Plus, after seeing White’s performance in the playoffs, why not take a chance on the young guard? Mills has a shorter and smaller contract and allows this team to be more flexible moving forward. 

Why the Spurs do it:

Fans of the NBA have one of two opinions on the Spurs. The first - this team is on the down swing in a loaded conference, and should be happy to ever reach the playoffs next year. These people see an aging Aldridge, a flawed DeRozan, and a coach who’s close to being ready to hang it up and call it a career. The second - look past the current stars and you see guys coming up who could keep the Spurs in the playoffs for another decade. Dejounte Murray was hurt all last year, but he has elite defensive potential and can be the PG of the franchise. Some of you may have also seen that Lonnie Walker is killing it in the summer league, and the Spurs are absolutely ecstatic about his game. The old guard may be closer to giving up the mantle to the young bucks than most fans think. 

Unfortunately the Spurs got screwed this offseason when they traded Bertrand to the Wizards thinking they had a deal with Marcus Morris, only to see Morris back out (still uncertain). But even with Morris, this team is a little short on front court talent after Aldridge. By trading for Gordon, age 24, they could bet on improving the jumper of a really talented player who could burst onto the scene if put in a better franchise situation. Trading Derrick White hurts, but ultimately you can only play two of him, Walker, and Murray alongside DeRozan, where as Gordon &amp; Aldridge can play together. Not to mention Iwundu was very effective off the bench for Orlando last season, and their pick this year is not likely to have great return value.

But when it comes down to ranking players, these 2 seem to disrespected the most. Let’s start with Harden. He has shown the past 2 seasons he is capable of being the only player in the league to lead a team that competes against the KD Warriors, and puts up otherworldly counting stats on great efficiency. Yet, critics and fans rank him below Anthony Davis occasionally? AD is a great player, but his counting stats and efficiency are nowhere close to Harden’s and if people hold Harden’s subpar playoff resumé over him; AD has only one playoff series win under his belt, and only 2 playoff appearances. Defense, sure AD is better, but Harden isn’t playing like it’s 2014-15 anymore, he actually gives a solid effort on that end, and offense outweighs defense by a fairly large margin currently in the NBA, so being below average at defense compared to otherworldly offensively is a plus.

Onto Steph now; the guy is a 2 time MVP, the greatest shooter of all time, the best off-ball player ever, a top 5 scorer in the league, the most efficient high-volume player in the league, etc. Last season he had the highest net rating and cumulative plus-minus as well. So why is he always rated below LeBron, Kawhi, KD, etc? LeBron missed 1/3 of the season, played passive offense, lazy defense, and missed the playoffs; how is he being rated over Steph currently when last season Steph outplayed him?

&amp;#x200B;

**Why MIN does it**

They essentially trade bad salary (Wiggins, Dieng) for other bad salary (Westbrook) but get a significant talent upgrade, especially for a team that has few other ways to get a player of WB's caliber. Deadly PnR with Russ/Towns, especially when Towns pops and teams have to decide between a Towns 3 and a WB drive. WB has plenty of issues but he is a spectacular passer, and if he has Towns at the 5 instead of Adams, it could be dynamite on offense. Augustin is a better fit beside WB or 6th man as a reliable spot up shooter and mistake-free floor general. Roberson will also get plenty of run and will guard the star guards MIN will face. The price they pay for this talent upgrade is two of their own 1sts, which I would project as landing in the 10-20 range.

**Why OKC does it**

Presti loves guys with physical talent and potential, and he gets 3 of them here. OKC will be a great home for the Wiggins revival project, and at worst he will be fantastic tank commander that will help OKC's own picks gain value. Fultz is a project, but all hope is not lost, while Okogie has the makings of a solid contributor with some upside. Mostly, this helps quicken OKC's rebuild and they add to their war chest of picks with MIN's 2 first rounders, of which 2022 does have some upside of being in 5-10 range with the potential of WB declining to nothing/Towns getting traded or both. 

**Why ORL does it**

Teague can be a moderate upgrade at PG with his offensive creation ability and if things don't work out, they can explore deals for him at the deadline (only 1 year left on his deal, should be moveable). Ferguson shores up some minutes that Fultz might have played. They fill in the gaps in this trade, and get 1 pick for making the math work and the juicy OKC 2nd for Fultz, whose value has plummeted.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,59278,public,self,OKC-MIN-ORL Westbrook trade?,0,1562886856,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cbnzq8/okcminorl_westbrook_trade/,,,,,,,,,,

The 76ers have a Ben Simmons problem. He has gotten worse as the playoffs have gone on—from averages of 17.2 points and 7.6 assists against the Nets in the first round to 9.4 points and 4.6 assists against the Raptors in the second. The same thing happened last year, when he played like a superstar against the Heat and was invisible against the Celtics. There’s a simple explanation, one Philadelphia can no longer ignore: Simmons can dominate on talent alone against lesser competition, but the holes in his game get exposed against elite teams. And nothing about that will change until the Sixers change his role. The truth is Simmons has spent his first two NBA seasons playing out of position. He’s not a point guard; he’s a center.

The equation changes in the playoffs. There isn’t much that Simmons can do against teams that can control the tempo of the game, pack the paint, and take away his ability to drive. The 76ers run an unorthodox offense in the regular season to maximize the abilities of their young star: They were tied for no. 2 in the NBA in the percentage of their offense that comes from dribble handoffs (8.2), and in the bottom two in the percentage of their offense that comes from pick-and-roll ball handlers (11.5) and roll men (3.5). Those numbers normalize in the playoffs: Dribble handoffs have dropped to 6.1 percent of their total offense, while the percentage that comes from ball handlers in the pick-and-roll increases to 15.3. It all goes back to Simmons. Philadelphia isn’t running as much offense through him against Toronto as it did in the regular season.

The downside of making that switch is that Simmons doesn’t have much to do. There are a lot of possessions where he brings the ball up the court, gives it to Butler, and then hangs out on the baseline. His poor shooting means that he can’t play on the perimeter without the ball in his hands, and the lack of shooting around him means that he can’t make cuts to the basket, either. Butler has encouraged Simmons to be more aggressive on offense, but the way he’s being used doesn’t give him many avenues to funnel his aggression. The result is a player who looks passive and indecisive. Simmons has not made an impact on the series: The 76ers have a net rating of minus-5 in his 178 minutes on the floor.

There is a Plan C, one that would move Simmons off the ball and still allow him to contribute on offense: using him as a screener in the pick-and-roll. That role would unlock the best aspects of his game and keep defenses from sagging off him. Simmons would have a counter for everything—he could post up smaller defenders if they switched the screen, roll to the rim and catch lobs against a drop coverage, and make plays in four-on-three situations if they blitzed the screen. He could be a bigger and more athletic version of Draymond Green with more scoring ability. A player can be only as good as the role that he is used in. Draymond wouldn’t be anywhere near as valuable on a team that played only conventional lineups. Spending time at the 5 is even more important for Simmons because he can’t shoot. He wouldn’t have to become a role player. He could do everything that Draymond does while also averaging 20 to 25 points a game.

The obvious solution is to go small with Simmons at the 5. However, they haven’t gone to those lineups much: They have a net rating of plus-11.2 in 39 minutes in the regular season, and minus-16.8 in 14 minutes in the playoffs. The sample size in each of the Sixers’ playoff series this year is tiny: Those lineups were plus-37.0 in nine minutes against the Nets, and minus-136.4 in five minutes against the Raptors. What happened in the Brooklyn series is fascinating, though. Philadelphia closed the fourth quarter of Game 3, which Embiid missed with a knee injury, with Simmons at the 5. It was the best game of his playoff career: He finished with 31 points on 11-for-13 shooting, nine assists, four rebounds, three blocks, and two steals. Look at how much space he has on these plays:


Simmons has the physical tools to play at the 5. He’s one of the most versatile defenders in the NBA: He’s guarded D’Angelo Russell and Kawhi Leonard this postseason; there’s no reason that he couldn’t hold his own against even the biggest centers, too. Simmons towers over both Draymond and P.J. Tucker, the two small-ball 5s in the second-round series between the Warriors and the Rockets. That said, it wouldn’t be an easy transition. Draymond and Tucker were second-round picks who fought their way into the league. They were willing to do whatever it took, even if it meant giving up their bodies to bang against bigger players in the paint. Simmons would have to be willing to do the same, and he would have to learn how to protect the rim and quarterback the defense. It’s unglamorous work that a 22-year-old who was taken no. 1 overall in the draft might not want to do. Simmons might need to learn the hard way through repeated playoff failures before he’s willing to change his approach to the game.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,59265,public,self,"Ben Simmons Is a Center, Not a Point Guard",0,1562881146,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cbmved/ben_simmons_is_a_center_not_a_point_guard/,,,,,,,,,,

Hey everyone, welcome back to the (un)official reddit player rankings of the 2019 offseason. 

Last time, y'all voted for the Top 5 players based primarily on the 2019 season and playoffs. I got 200+ responses (thank you everyone who participated!); here are the detailed results:

Note: The above chart includes only players who got 5 or more votes. There were a few players that got like one vote that I excluded.

Some notes on the data:

* The top 5 was way more controversial this time. Last year, LeBron James was the consensus #1 player. Not only was he displaced by Kawhi Leonard, he also faced some tough competition from KD, Steph, and Giannis.
* Still, Kawhi and LeBron seem to be in their own ""tier."" They seem to be ""Tier 1,"" being the only players to accumulate more than 500 points. Then Tier 2 seems to KD and Steph who were only 9 points off from each other, with Giannis a clear 5th.
* Steph is the only non-forward in the top 5.
* Last year, the Western Conference had all of the top 5. Now, we have a 2/3 split, with the West still slightly edging out the East.

---

Today, we'll be voting on the rest of the top 10. Please go to this link to fill out the form (or the one in bold at the top): https://forms.gle/f7eHhNR8Ty8Q7dro9

Let me just remind everyone once again that **this ranking is reflective.** A few people seemed to be under the impression that they could not rank KD because he is injured next season. But remember that we are primarily basing these rankings off the 2018-2019 season and playoffs and how each player performed specifically during that time. So, **yes, KD and Klay, who played the majority of last season, are fair game; John Wall, KP, or Oladipo, who had to sit out last season, will not be a part of these rankings.**

I'll report back with the results at around the same time tomorrow and continue on to the top 15.

Thank you for your participation!

To look at these, I check the most used playstyles of teams and their best players (Kawhi and PG for clippers, Bron and AD for lakers)
 
Clippers
Here’s the clipper’s most used playstyles (from https://Stats.nba.com/teams/isolation)
1. Transition (15.1 possessions per game (poss) with 1.08 points per possessions (PPP))
2. P&amp;R Ball Handler (25.8 poss with 0.9 PPP)
3. Spot up (19.4 poss with 1.08 PPP)
4. P &amp; R Roll and post up (7.9 poss each with 1.21 and 0.97 PPP, respectively)

I would guess that P&amp;R of the clippers is Lou and Trez while the spot up is Shamet, Beverly, Gallinari and Tobias (before the last two got traded.)
 
Here are the playstyles of Kawhi and PG
 
PG
1. P&amp;R Handler (6.5 poss, 1.02 PPP)
2. Transition(5.4 poss, 1.11 PPP)
3. Iso (3.5 poss, 0.92 PPP)
4. Spot up (3.1 poss, 1.27PPP)

Kawhi

1. P&amp;R Handler (6.3 poss, 1.01 PPP)
2. Transition(4.2 poss, 1.31 PPP)
3. Iso (3.9 poss,1.05 PPP)
4. Spot up (2.6 poss, 1.15PPP)

It is interesting to note that PG and Kawhi have the same playstyle. The both generate high PPP in transition due to their defense and I expect this to continue. I think the clippers will run more P&amp;R sets with PG handling the ball and kawhi screening (or vice versa). I suspect that whoever handles the ball will look to score, if the ball handler is doubled/trapped, it’s a pass to the screener or other spot up shooters (Shamet, Beverly and even Lou Will). I also see higher PPP for post up plays that are also ISO plays for PG and Kawhi which mixes mid-range or attacking the rim.
 
Lakers
 
It’s inappropriate to look at the playstyles used last season cause Frank Vogel is the new head coach. So I look at Vogel’s playstyle with the Orlando Magic (Although Lebron might want to run different set of plays so this harder for me to see)
 
Here’s the top plays used by the Magic when Vogel was still the coach
 
1. Spot up(23.4 poss with 1.08 PPP
2. P&amp;R Ball Handler (18.3 poss with 0.82 PPP)
3. Transition (4.7 poss with 1.08 PPP)
4. Cut (8.1 poss 1.27 PPP)

It seems that Vogel utilizes spot up shooting created from Pick and roll of Aaron Gordon and Vucevic. With some cutting from other role players.
 
Here are the playstyles of Lebron and AD
 
Lebron
1. P&amp;R Ball Handler (7.5 poss with 0.98 PPP)
2. Transition (5.7 poss with 1.14 PPP)
3. ISO (4.7 poss with 0.97 PPP)
4. Post up (2.2 poss with 1.01 PPP)
 
AD
1. Post up (4.3 poss with 0.97 PPP)
2. P&amp;R Roll (3.3 poss with 1.02 PPP)
3. Transition (3.1 poss with 1.15 PPP)
4. Spot up (2.8 poss  with 1.07 PPP)

It looks like Lebron as the ball handler and AD as the roll man will be the best play. Which is a better version of what Vogel did in Orlando.
The best lineup would be to surround AD and LBJ with the shooters as they run the P&amp;R. Davis’ has a good midrange game and can finish above the rim which should open up a lot of looks for other shooters.
LBJ and Davis posting up is also good as they would demand double teams which would create better looks for other shooters.
 
TLDR
I think Lakers will run a lot of P&amp;R with lebron handling the ball and AD finishing at the rim or doing a mid range shot which opens up space other shooters. Clippers will run P&amp;R with both kawhi and PG switching roles as handler &amp; rollman. Both teams have spot up shooters so 3pt shooting should improve compared to last year. It should be a fun series if both teams face each other in the playoffs

This past playoffs against portland, he played TERRIBLE games 1-4, shooting something like 36% including a 19% FG showing in game 3, where Russ won the game for them. It was only until game 5 PG shot 70% that made his end stats look passable. I guess because of recency bias, people forget about his earlier games?

The year prior to that where OKC lost to a rookie Donovan Mitchell, PG also didn’t play well, shooting 40% for the series, and putting up a whopping 5 points in the closeout game 6 while Russ went for 46 (albeit on bad shooting). 

In Indiana, I also hate the narrative of “PG went head to head with Lebron”. I mean in 2013 he didn’t even play better than Roy Hibbert in the ECF. 

As a side note, I also have no clue how PG stayed in the MVP conversation by the end of the season, even finishing 3rd. OKC had sub 50 wins and was the 6th seed, one loss away from 8th. He didn’t best Giannis or Harden in points, rebounds, or assists, and IMO wasn’t a better defender than Giannis.

So a team with a 1st round pick gets contract that’s for a 1st round pick. There’s also no scale. All 1st round picks will be the same contract money wise. Let’s say 8 million a year for 4 years. All 2nd round picks will be for less and also will be all equal. 

The common complaint is that if we eliminated the draft that all the best players will go to a big market. 

But with this in structure in place, it would prevent that because teams would only be allowed to pick 2 rookies, a 1st round talent and a 2nd round talent. 

Star rookies also wouldn’t necessarily go to big markets because nowadays you don’t need to a big market to have a brand. You can be on any team, as long as you’re good, you get a starting role and starter mins. 

Would a rookie like Zion choose to go Philly when Ben Simmons is already there? The fit is not there basketball wise. 

Players would choose the team that gives them the best chance at starting and being a franchise changer. 

Eliminating the draft means there’s no incentive to tank so that teams can try to win without being punished by management and get rewarded for winning. 

Teams that haven’t done well (like Suns, Knicks, Charlotte etc) will need to prove to rookies that they are going to improve the team and focus on them. That means investing in new facilities, more/better trainers, culture, management, Coach etc to prove that they are turning over a new leaf. 

Players are recruited for college and colleges have to make an effort to recruit them. They actually have a choice. 

Denying these rookies the freedom to work where they want is just not right. Imagine if you just graduated from school and your job and where you want to work is not even your choice. You get shipped out to somewhere you don’t like or don’t know and you have no voice. 

If we’re truly in the player empowerment era, then rookies should have just as much choice as free agent players. 

The fixation on ranking players by a number is just stupid and it forces teams to draft players based on a number. A number 1 vs number 5. 12 vs 25. Etc 

There are so many examples of players who were overlooked and could have been drafted higher and vice versus players who shouldn’t have. I.e fultz vs Tatum. Or fultz vs Donovan Mitchell. Or Mitchell Robinson in the 2nd round or kuzma or draymond. Giannis. Etc 

It clouds people’s judgement. Instead by having free agency for rookies, team can choose someone based on who they think is actually going to be the right fit for the team without worrying about drafting a guy projected to be 15 and picking him at 7. They can just pick who’s the best for them, not who’s the highest on the mock draft, and not worry about being ridiculed. 

And rookies can choose the team that’s right for THEM. The wrong team can mess up a player’s career. 

If you’re a ball dominant PG, you probably don’t want to get drafted by a team that has a ball dominant PG because you won’t have a chance to play your style or get minutes.

Prior to the Grant trade, OKC were $10.830 million over the luxury tax line. When your payroll is above the luxury tax line for 3 straight seasons, or for the 3rd time in 4 seasons, you\'re required to pay what\'s called a ""repeater tax."" The Thunder have been a perennial luxury/repeater tax team for a while now, which meant for the 2019-20 season -- they would\'ve been paying roughly a 4x multiple on every dollar spent over the tax line. What would that have meant? -- an additional \\~$43 million in tax dollars.\n\nNow, there\'s a reason Jerami Grant ($9.346 million) was shipped off to Denver relatively on the cheap with no salary returns. The luxury tax line for the 2019-20 NBA season is set at $132.627 million and the Thunder\'s payroll after the Grant trade is down to $134.111 million.

Well you can bet that, prior to Grant\'s trade, inquiring GMs will have tried to use OKC\'s luxury tax situation as leverage against them, and lowballed on any offers. But the fact that all the Thunder need to do now is shed $1.484 million in salaries, that brings back a shit ton of leverage in any negotiations.

I am curious though, having looked through the last month of posts: NONE are about the Blazers or their offseason. Sure it wasn't glamorous and they lost a lot of their core, but they also filled some holes while Nurkic rehabs. 

As Lowe points out in his latest Winners and Losers column, picking the Blazers as a winner, Mo and Aminu were great defenders, but liabilities on O. ET was a blackhole +/- and Meyers was unplayable. 

Getting the guys they got (Bazemore, Whiteside, drafting Nas Little, and growing Collins and Simons) was a step-up, though not a gargantuan one. A lot rests on how the young guys show up and how Dame and CJ come to ball. If they get the regular season Dame and playoff McCollum, there's no reason for them not to end up Top 4 in the West again. 

Sure, there have been seismic shifts worth talking about way more this offseason. But if any team is going to pull it off again, make the playoffs and perhaps make a run, while everyone else acts surprised, it's them. 

1. Where do you see the Blazers seeding?
2. Olshay the GM picking up expiring contracts in Baze and Hassan might indicate he is looking to make a major move - he has said he wants to capitalize on Dame's and CJ's primes.

Who performs roughly the same every night? Who suffers from wild variations in performance? 

**Scoring consistency of 25PPG players**

[In this graph](https://imgur.com/a/WYD7fbv), each game played by the 13 players who averaged 25 points per game is plotted. The players' respective overall PPG is shown in red. At the top of the plot are the most consistent players, as measured by the coefficient of variation. This coefficient of variation is simply the standard deviation of a player's output in points divided by that player's PPG. The lower the coefficient of variation, the more consistent the player is. In other words, a player who averages 25PPG with a standard deviation of 7 (meaning that in a typical game, they finish 7 points away from their overall PPG) is deemed to be more consistent than another player who averages 25 PPG with a standard deviation of 10. The coefficient of variation for each player is shown in parentheses on the y axis, next to each player's name. 

(Quick statistical aside: Why not simply look at standard deviation? Because the standard deviation tends to be higher when the mean is higher, which would make players with a very high PPG appear much more inconsistent than they really are.)

So what can we learn from this graph? There are some significant differences in consistency *even for players with similar PPG averages*. For example, while LeBron James and Steph Curry average almost exactly the same number of points (27.4 and 27.3, respectively), the Warriors' point guard is much more likely to explode for 40+ or score fewer than 20 points. At the extreme of the spectrum lies Kemba Walker,  who is wildly inconsistent in terms of nightly scoring. In fact, among 25PPG players since the 2000-01 season, Kemba's 2018-19 season is the least consistent of all with a coefficient of variation of 0.392. With an average output of 25.6 points and a standard deviation of 10.0, it is unsurprising to see Kemba go for 15 or 35. In fact, Kemba scoring 15 or less OR scoring 35 or more occurred 27 times last season - almost 1/3rd of the games he played! By comparison, Bradley Beal, who averaged exactly the same PPG, scored between 16 and 34 in all but 13 games. 

**Consistency in gamescore**

I also looked at the consistency of players' gamescores. This allows us to have a more nuanced look since it incorporates more aspects of the game - rebounding, turnovers, etc.
[
Here is the relevant graph.](https://imgur.com/a/JBxM4Ht) Included are all 11 players who averaged a gamescore of 20 or more. Again, LeBron and Kawhi appear to perform roughly the same every night, while Curry is much more prone to off nights/very impressive games. 

**Consistency in historical perspective**

How much of a difference can this make? Arguably, quite a bit. Let's look at two extreme cases to illustrate this point. As measured by gamescore using the coefficient of variation, these are the most consistent seasons since 2000-01 (only 20+ gamescore):



Player | Season | Mean gamescore | SD gamescore | Coefficient of variation
------|------|--------------|------------|------------------------
Kevin Durant | 2012-13 | 23.02 | 5.34 | 0.23
LeBron James | 2012-13 | 24.40 | 6.12 | 0.25
Kevin Durant | 2015-16 | 22.11 | 5.65 | 0.25
Kevin Garnett | 2003-04 | 22.19 | 6.10 | 0.27
LeBron James | 2016-17 | 22.80 | 6.37 | 0.27
LeBron James | 2015-16 | 20.74 | 5.82 | 0.28
LeBron James | 2009-10 | 25.58 | 7.28 | 0.28


Really impressive to see LeBron 4 times on this list (he has 8 of the top 20 most consistent seasons in gamescore since 2000-01). Here are the least consistent seasons in gamescore in that same timeframe (minimum average gamescore of 20):




Player | Season | Mean gamescore | SD gamescore | Coefficient of variation
------|------|--------------|------------|------------------------
Gilbert Arenas | 2006-07 | 20.05 | 10.64 | 0.53
James Harden | 2014-15 | 21.76 | 10.00 | 0.46
Kobe Bryant | 2006-07 | 22.53 | 10.16 | 0.45
Jimmy Butler | 2016-17 | 20.75 | 9.27 | 0.44
Amar'e Stoudemire | 2004-05 | 20.24 | 9.00 | 0.44
Gilbert Arenas | 2005-06 | 20.40 | 9.05 | 0.44
Steph Curry | 2018-19 | 20.56 | 8.93 | 0.43

For the sake of comparison, [let's compare Gilbert Arenas' sadly historic 2006-07 season to a highly consistent season with a similar average gamescore: LeBron's 2015-16 season.](https://imgur.com/a/3WNntMz) There is only a slight difference in mean gamescore, with LeBron edging Arenas by approximately 0.7. However, as the plot shows, LeBron was remarkably consistent whereas Arenas alternated between highly productive games (including the 44th highest gamescore in NBA history on December 17th, 2006) and awful performances, including a 3-point, 1-for-12 effort for a gamescore of -6.6 (yes, that's a negative gamescore).

Designated Player Tag
1) My first idea (these arent 100% fleshed out, moreso general ideas) is to have teams able to give a ""designated franchise player"" type tag to 1 player and have their salary exceed normal max percentages but only affect the salary cap at a locked percentage. 

For example: let's say Kemba decided to resign in CHA, they would give him the DFP tag and then let's say it allows them to pay him 30% more than the max he is currently allowed. That 30% extra wont count towards the salary cap so they arent hindered by the MASSIVE chunk of cap space that the current supermax takes up. 


No Trade Clause for Teams
2) The second idea goes with the first one but could also be it's own thing for the supermax or whatever. 
My suggestion is that when a player signs the DFP or supermax they are automatically put into a no trade clause for the first 2 years or half of the contract (or some period of time that works better) but instead of the player controlling the trade clause, it makes neither the team or the player able to make the decision to trade until the arbitrary period of time is reached. I think this could get rid of any ""sign and dash"" deals where the superstar signs for the money and then demands a trade shortly after.

It rewards bad teams too highly. The draft encourages teams to take the best player available regardless of need. The current system forces young players to play for teams that they may not want to play for. If the draft is eliminated it would allow rookies more freedom to take things like playing time, team fit, and location into their decision; This would in turn increase the likelihood they stay with their franchise.

**The Plan**

Take current rookie signing scale and apply it to teams based on previous season’s record. Teams would then use this salary number to entice rookies. Using the current NBA season The Knicks could offer $8.1M/year and the Bucks could offer $1.6M/year

Each draft team is limited to one first round contract. This number could be increased through trades. Current Example: The Hawks, after trades, would have had the 4th highest contact ($5.9M/year) and the 10th highest ($3.5M/year)

The Worst 5-8 teams (depending on ties) would get a 3 day head start to free agency. Using this current season: The Knicks/Suns/Cavs/Bull/Hawks could start negotiating/signing with rookies on  June 20th and the rest of the league would start on June 23rd.

**Possible Tweaks**

-The rookie contracts could be exceptions similar to the Mid Level Exception.

-Teams over the salary could be limited to only minimum contracts.

-Teams with multiple first round contracts could combine the money into bigger deals.

-The salary scaling and early negotiations could be changed to accommodate the worse teams.

-Eliminate the scaling all together. If you have the cap and want to sign Zion for 50 million go for it.

**Closing Statement**

This is not a perfect solution and it could be tweaked any number of ways. There are always unforeseen consequences and drawbacks to any plan. The current draft system is far from perfect. This plan would allow for more player and team freedom. It would also give teams with young stars more freedom to team build around them and potentially keep their talent.


**TLDR** Eliminate the draft. Create a rookie free agency. Give the worst teams a 3 day head start and the ability to sign rookies for more money.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,58055,public,self,Proposal for Eliminating the NBA Draft.,0,1562776351,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cb36qh/proposal_for_eliminating_the_nba_draft/,,,,,,,,,,

However, it was the [following feedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/c451cg/relative_champion_strength_as_determined_by/ervg8wj/) from u/LordDickRichard that inspired me to explore further:

&gt; a healthy golden state might have won the title so without examination of runners up of past years there is reallly no saying weither or not the raptors are ""worthy"" champions since it seems possible the champions weren't always the highest ranked in pte. 

At first I thought this would be too much work - after all, why stop at runners-up? A conference finalist could easily have a higher ranking, and so on and so forth. But I discovered a quick workaround, and lo and behold, here's every playoff team since 1974:

Hello everyone, welcome to the second year of the (un)official /r/NBA player rankings! We'll be ranking the players based primarily on the 2018-2019 regular season and playoffs.

To quickly recap: the purpose of this ranking is to try to settle some of the ""top 5"" and ""top 10"" debates by running polls, while also hopefully leaving down in history what our opinions of the current top players are, so we can laugh (or be shocked) at them later down the road.

There was a bit of confusion in last year's rankings about whether these rankings are predictive or reflective. For this year, we're going full reflective — please rank your top players based primarily on the 2018-2019 season. This means players that were injured last season won't be featured in the polls (John Wall, Victor Oladipo), while players that played this year but are injured next year will be (Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson).

For the first part, I want you to rank your Top 5 NBA players. Please go to the link below and fill out your Top 5 players in order.

https://forms.gle/bHwCK1LNjreq2x796

The way the scoring works is that the person you vote as #1 gets 5 points, #2 gets 4 points, #3 gets 3 points etc. Then, after calculating all the points, I will report back with Reddit's Top 5. I'll report back with the results tomorrow at approximately this time (10 PM EST / 7 PM PST) or maybe a bit earlier and continue on to finish the Top 10.

&amp;#x200B;

As someone who frequents this sub, I wanted to share some work of mine from this past year that may be of interest to some of you. For my senior thesis this past year, inspired by my interest in basketball stats, I set out to try to predict the success second-round picks based on their stats from college. Why only second-round draft picks, you might ask? Because as most NBA fans can relate to, we almost always expect our teams' first-round draft picks to be good. Dare I say even great. However, we're much less invested in second-round picks, who are often fringe roster guys. However, when a second-round draft pick pans out, it provides a huge edge to a team as these are guys who at least initially are on very cheap contracts. If we're just looking at these past NBA finals alone, key guys like Danny Green, Marc Gasol, and of course Draymond Green were all former second-rounders. To make things even more interesting, instead of using traditional statistics, like points, rebounds, assists, etc, I decided to take a dive into the world of advanced metrics, due to the analytics craze going on in sports, to see if any of these stats were useful predictors for the success of second-round picks.

&amp;#x200B;

Without further ado, on to the study. As the actual thesis is very long and contains some dense statistics (link at the bottom if you're interested or just really bored), I have summarized the key points of the study below:

&amp;#x200B;

**Abstract**

The second-round is often an overlooked portion of the NBA draft, and second-round draft picks are often viewed as peripheral assets in trades. However, finding key contributors in the second-round can go a long way towards building a successful team. This thesis aims to identify key statistics from a player’s college career that may be able to help predict a player’s success in the NBA. To do so, various methods of regression will be used with a variety of advanced college basketball statistics as potential predictor variables to produce models for both longevity and productivity in the NBA. In addition, these models will be applied to previous second-round picks to see how well they predict the performance of well-known NBA second rounders. In producing these models, win shares, and more specifically, defensive win shares, were found to be a significant predictor for multiple responses, providing evidence that defensive win shares in college may be a crucial advanced statistic to key in when searching for value in the second-round of the NBA draft. In addition, the success of forwards also seemed to differ from the success of non-forwards. When applied to past second-round picks, these models predicted favorable outcomes for notable NBA second-round picks, such as Hassan Whiteside and Draymond Green.

&amp;#x200B;

**Goals**

The aim of this thesis was to identify statistics that are correlated with second-rounder success. To do so, a variety of advanced basketball statistics were used to compare a player’s performance in college to their performance in the NBA. In the end, the goal was to uncover a set of variables that are common to second-round draft pick success in the NBA.

&amp;#x200B;

**Methods**

While there are many ways to evaluate a player's success in the NBA, for the purposes of this study, success was measured in two ways: longevity and productivity. In order to measure longevity, the number of seasons a player played in the NBA was used. Productivity was evaluated using total win shares to measure productivity across a player’s career as well as win shares per 48 to measure per minute productivity. In the process of analyzing these responses, the position a player plays was also considered as a potentially significant variable, since different positions in basketball are asked to fulfill different roles on a team.

&amp;#x200B;

The following statistics were used as potential predictors:

* Total Games Played
* Games and Minutes Played in Final Year of College
* True Shooting and Effective Field Goal Percentage
* Offensive, Defensive, and Total Rebounding Percentage
* Assist Rate
* Steal Rate
* Block Rate
* Turnover Rate
* Usage Rate
* Points Produced
* Offensive and Defensive Rating
* Offensive, Defensive, and Total Win Shares
* Offensive, Defensive, and Total Box Plus/Minus

&amp;#x200B;

Once models were developed for each of the outcomes above, they were applied to past draft picks in order to see how well they fare in predicting their careers. Rankings of draft picks were created by averaging the player’s ranking among each of the three main response variables based on predictions from the respective models.

&amp;#x200B;

It should be noted that players who did not play in college (ex. international players) were excluded from the study since the basis of the study was the use of college statistics.

&amp;#x200B;

**Results**

|*Response*|*Predictors In Model*|*Significant Predictors*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Years Played|Total Games Played, Defensive Win Shares|Defensive Win Shares|
|Win Shares|Games Played in Final Year of College, Offensive Rating, Defensive Win Shares, Assist Rate, Forward, Forward:Assist Rate|Forward, Forward:Assist Rate|
|Win Shares Per 48|Minutes Played in Final Year of College, Win Shares, Block Rate, Forward:Block Rate|Win Shares, Block Rate, Forward|

&amp;#x200B;

In the table above, the "":"" indicates an interaction term, so for example, Forward:Assist Rate means the assist rate for forwards specifically, as opposed to guards or centers.

**Conclusions:**

Overall, this analysis provides evidence that win shares in college are a potential predictor of NBA success for second-round picks, as defensive win shares are a significant predictor of years played and total win shares are a significant predictor of win shares per 48. In addition, there is evidence that the success of forwards differs significantly from non-forwards, as forward is a significant predictor in both win shares and win shares per 48. When applying these models to previous second-round picks, they often favored forwards/centers more than guards, especially ones known for their defense. For instance, the models successfully predicted the successes of many players, such as Hassan Whiteside, Draymond Green, and Jae Crowder, but missed on others, such as Khris Middleton and Isaiah Thomas. From a basketball standpoint, the emphasis on defense in second-round picks should not come as too much of a surprise, since second-round players are much more likely to become solid-role players in the NBA rather than bona-fide superstars that a team builds around. Coaches in the NBA are always looking for players who are hard-nosed defenders and are willing to sacrifice their bodies for the team, and players who excel on defense in college seem fit to translate their success into productive NBA careers.

The problem is that about 12 guys are ""top 5"" apparently and the league has 47 superstars. Getting rankings down on paper can tricky, but I would be curious to just see where some of you guys draw up the tiers of NBA players.

Tier 1:

LeBron AD Steph KD Giannis Kawhi Harden

Explanation: This tier seems the clearest to me. Before last season, I probably would have had LeBron and KD in a tier of their own, but going into next season I think the title for ""Best Player in the NBA"" is very much up for grabs. If we were doing a 1 season re-draft of the NBA, these are the guys you could pick first without me calling you a moron. 
 
Tier 2:

PG Jokic Embiid Lillard KAT Russ Kyrie Beal Klay Kemba Jimmy

Explanation- This is where things get murky for me. I think you could both realistically cut this into two tiers or make it even bigger without it seeming too crazy. I think PG Embiid Jokic would probably round out my top 10 if I were to cut it that way. I'm not sure Klay could carry a team like most of these guys but I think his ultimate 3 and D skillset makes him arguably more valuable to many teams. (I am an Iggy fan that has been rooting for the Warriors so I might be biased). 

Tier 3:

Gobert Oladipo Blake Draymond 

Explanation: Two DPOYs, an oft-injured but consistently good and gifted big, and a rising 2 way star shooting guard with some injury problems of his own. Gobert should maybe be tier 2 and the rest don't necessarily deserve to be separated from tier 4 but this felt right to me. Again possibly biased on the Draymond front.
 
Tier 4:

LaMarcus Jrue Conley Lowry Simmons DeMar Booker Horford CP3 Siakam Middleton Harris Mitchell Luka Fox

Explanation: It is pretty close to a crap shoot at this point. It is really hard to compare some of these unproven up-and-comers to some of the steady veterans that any team would love to have (contracts aside). I could see a smarter person than I arranging this into multiple tiers or making some swaps in a way that I would actually agree with more than mine.

Justice Winslow showed some promise this year but his skill set overlaps with SGA's quite a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the trade:

OKC Gets: Andrew Wiggins, Jeff Teague, Houston 2020 first, Lottery protected Minnesota 2020 first

HOU gets: Russell Westbrook

MINN gets: Chris Paul

Why HOU does it: With the CP-Harden relationship in doubt and no easy way to get rid of CP without giving up assets, I think it makes sense to just swap one monstrous contract for another, not sure if Houston gets that much better but at least Russ is younger and is friends with Harden.

Why OKC does it: Taking on Wiggins contract is tough, but Presti always has loved athletic freaks and the Thunder don't project to contend any time soon so taking a flyer on Wiggins won't hurt too much. Plus they accrue more assets and a guy to mentor SGA in teague, and he may even be a guy that they could trade at the deadline for more assets.

Why MIN does it: I'm sure plenty of wolves fans would object to taking on CP's contract but it has one less year than Wiggins and it's a move to show Towns that the franchise is serious about winning. I'd have them put heavy protections on the pick, something like 1-20 protected before conveying as 2 seconds or something like that.

LeBron is often viewed to be very similar to Magic in the sense that he was physically the same and had the same vision and BBIQ and he has often said that his preferred style is pass first. The league has changed quite dramatically from when Magic used to play. Even back then Magic wasn't the greatest of defenders and would often get beat by quicker guards although he wasn't a bad defender. 

It's clear that no matter what position LBJ is listed as he won't guard the PGs/SGs of the other team as that is too much work. Interested to see what Vogel has in mind when he wants LeBron as PG when he already plays that role.

* What is the implication of him actually being listed as PG for the Lakers? 

Is the coaching staff trying  to roll out a lineup with:

 **LeBron James**, **Two ""wings"" (KCP/Green)**, **AD**, and **McGee/Cousins** : Where KCP and Green pick up the defensive responsibility of guarding the smaller guards? 

**LeBron James**, **KCP/Green**, **Kuzma**, **AD**, **McGee/Cousins** : This seem to be the the logical idea behind having him listed as a PG but in this scenario Green/KCP would guard the PG, Kuzma would have chase the SG, and LeBron resorts to guarding the 3/4 to save energy. Kuzma isn't laterally quick enough to guard the 2 and he is too big to be chasing around/through screens so I don't see how defensively this is a good move. Furthermore, Kuzma was pretty bad from the arc last season and he is the second best shooter in this lineup. 

**LBJ**, **KCP**, **Green**, **Kuz**, **AD** : This lineup seems better in terms of stretching out the floor and having enough defensive versatility and would be a great closing lineup but AD prefers playing as PF where he doesn't bang with centers day in and out and can dominated other PF's in the league. AD also performs better defensively when he is a PF as most of his help comes from the side rather then being in front of the man like Cousins/traditional big because he is laterally quick enough to leave his man to try to block.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,57835,public,self,The Lakers intend to start LeBron James at PG.,0,1562705010,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/caqnmt/the_lakers_intend_to_start_lebron_james_at_pg/,,,,,,,,,,

Watching the Pelicans trapping Dame last year and using their length to both get the ball out of his hands and make it difficult for him to pass over, it seemed like they had figured out the formula to stopping Portland. Going into the playoffs this year, especially with Nurk out, it seemed like this same strategy would reap similar benefits, especially with okcs length and athleticism on the floor, but I remember them hedging rather than getting the ball out of his hands. 


I bring this up because Dame had, by far the best series in the first round and after that he kind of slowed down in the playoffs. I wasn't able to watch as many of their other rounds' games but it appears that other teams did a much better job guarding him. 


Do you think this was mostly a tactics thing or was Dame just on fire and adjusted well in the first round?
