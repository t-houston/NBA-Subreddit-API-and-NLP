I was at both the flu game and the push off game. Those are an odd combo of good/bad memories. 

* Here are my take(s) on Gobert/Mitchell:

* Utah is not normally part of any national media attention - so for this to be a story getting national attention is rare.  As such Jazz fans aren't always used to what degree national media will sensationalize, over hype, and honestly - misreport stories. I think The Athletic's and other reporting is accurate in the sense that it is based on actual quotes from both named and unnamed sources - but inaccurate in the sense that it is grossly overstated to fill the void.

* That said - Gobert has a maturity problem - and I do think Mitchell's frustration may go beyond the COVID-19 issue. Gobert's defense and overall effort has slipped this season and Gobert has been on record that he wants the ball more on offense which is a total joke given that Gobert has zero offensive skill outside of either a rebound putback dunk or catching an easy wide open pick and roll pass or lob for a dunk. If Gobert had even a modicum of post move ability or an 8-10 foot jump shot he would go from borderline all-star defensive gimmick to borderline MVP candidate. 

* Based on Gobert's video yesterday - I think that he and Mitchell will work things out. I also think that the national - if not worldwide embarrassment of Gobert touching all the microphones and the stories coming out about him kissing Mitchell and his immature actions even in the face of the Jazz head coach calling special team meetings in February and early March to discuss the seriousness of COVID-19 will mean that Gobert will have an increased level of maturity and seriousness when the team is able to return to practice and play.

* However - I think the Jazz are going to have a ceiling - low to mid 50 wins - perennial 3/4 seed - no salary cap room giving Gobert and Mitchell max deals. Mitchell looks to be more of a high volume/low efficiency Carmelo Anthony type player than he does an MVP candidate leader of a championship contender Dwayne Wade type player.

* As a lifelong Jazz fan I would love to be wrong about this - but that is my take for what it's worth (not much I know - but what else is there to do right now?)",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,82217,public,self,Lifelong Jazz Fan thoughts on Gobert/Mitchell,0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/g16d2c/lifelong_jazz_fan_thoughts_on_gobertmitchell/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So the first team consists of players who have only played for one team in their entire careers:


PG: Steph Curry (6x All-Nba, 3xChamp, 2x MVP, 30/6.5/5.5/2 best season ) 


SG: Kobe Bryant (15x All-NBA, 5x Champ, 1x MVP, 2x FVMP, 35.5/5.5/4.5/1.8 best season) 


SF: Giannis (3* All-NBA, 1*MVP, 30/13.5/6/1/1 best season) 


PF: Dirk Nowitzki (12x All-NBA, 1x Champ, 1x MVP, 1x FVMP, 26/10/3 and a block best season) 


C: Tim Duncan (15x All-NBA, 5x Champ, 2x MVP, 3x FVMP, 25.5/12.5/3.5 with 2.5 blocks best season) 

(Giannis will likely add another MVP and another All-NBA this season) 


VS


PG: Chris Paul (8x All-NBA, 6x STL Champ, 4x Ass Champ, 23/5.5/11/2.8 best season) 

SG: Dwyane Wade (8x All-NBA, 3x Champ, 1x FVMP, 30/5/7.5 with 2.2 stl and 1.3blk best season) 

SF: LeBron James (15x All-NBA*, 3x Champ, 4x MVP, 3x FMVP, 30/8/7/1.8/1.1 best season) 

PF: Kevin Durant (9x All-NBA, 2x Champ, 1x MVP, 2x FMVP, 32/7.5/5.5/1.3 best season) 

C: Shaq (14x All-NBa (8 in 21th century ),4x Champ, 1x MVP, 3x FMVP, 30/13.5/4 along with 3 blocks best season) 

(LeBron will probably add another All-NBA this season, CP could as well) 

Which team would you prefer? Each of the players on both teams is a top 3 player of all time at their position (TD as PF, Dirk maybe top 3 (KG, TD, Barkley, Malone), with the exception of Giannis who is not there yet. In terms of a real game, I think the first team would have more glaring weaknesses defensively (Dirk and Steph), but you would have Giannis surrounded by the best shooter of all time in Steph and an All-Time shooter in Dirk. Noone would clog the paint cause Timmy could bank shot his way to the win at will and there would be no chemistry issues with great team players like Timmy and Dirk (also Steph). And of course, there is Mamba at the shooting guard position. 

When it comes to chemistry, I don't think the second team would have any issues as well if KD can behave. Wade, LeBron and Shaq have all been teammates, and you have CP, a banana boat buddy and one of the best passers of all time. This team would wreak havoc on both ends of the floor, with prime early 00s shaq at the centre and the prime Miami Bron.

The obvious, the chosen one, #thekidfromAKRON, Lebron James

Averaging 26-11-8 on 50% on the best team in the league AT AGE 35. Nuff said

2. Kawhi Leonard 

Best defensive player in the game in addition to 27-7-5. Won a chip as the underdog last year. Can lock up the best player on any team and is a total mismatch on offense

3. Stephen Curry

Greatest shooter ever, incredible efficiency and leadership. Changes the game completely by just being on the court even if he’s not touching the ball. His ability to space the floor and open up the court for his teammates is unmatched

4. Kevin Durant

Incredible shooter and shot creator at almost 7ft, un-guardable and plays team ball. 

5. James Harden

1-man army, offensive juggernaut who is only slowed down with a double team. Unreal shooter, contact creator and ft maker, passer, and solid defender (contrary to popular belief). Was winning game with g-leaguers 2 seasons ago. Great efficiency (ts%)

6. Luka Doncic

Very similar to Harden. Y’all will probably throw a shitstorm about me putting him over Giannis/AD, but Luka is the superior halfcourt player, shooter and playmaker. Once (if) Lebron ever retires, the league is in his hands

7. Giannis

Great transition player, athlete, defender and rebounder. Modern day Shaq. However, I can’t see him winning a title as the guy RIGHT NOW. Too many holes in his game: can’t shoot, ball handle and weakness as a playmaker in the half-court. Slow down the pace of the game and he’s very stoppable. Eventually, maybe he can be that guy but he needs to add a reliable jay

8. Paul George

Knockdown from 3, elite wing defender and doesn’t need the ball in his hands to be productive although he’s shown than he is more than capable of taking it to the rim 

9. Nikola Jokic 

Offensive mastermind with major defensive flaws, but it doesn’t really matter. Denver is a top 3 seed in the west twice in a row, proves he makes his teammates better and contributes to major wins as the true #1 option

10. AD

Not a huge AD guy as y’all can probably tell by this rank. Barely made the playoffs on a solid Pelicans team (Jrue, DMC, Randle). Great defender, but his isolation game is horrible for the team. Playing with Lebron has strongly improved his mental game though

Ok so why do these guys do these and is the price fair-ish.

Portland:

This is the team you'd have to convince the most. It's damn difficult to move from CJ, his shooting and end of shot clock iso is very hard to replace but here's my reasoning. It's not getting any easier and much better with this combo. This season they were 3.5 games back from the 8th seed this year. This trade gets Dame the help he desperately needs.Albeit probably doesn't make them a top 4 seed in the west but it keeps them competitive. They get compensated with 5 firsts for taking on Love and Harris' BS contracts although they will still help the club. They also have options at this point, they would have the happy problem of figuring out how to best use these draft picks from Phi and Bos largely to build a champ for Dame. I think parting ways with CJ is worth the price of that optionality (is that a word?)

Cleveland:
This should be easy right? You get Hassan's expiring, plus 3 picks to rebuild around Garland and Sexton. Only two things that sucks, it's not a great draft (whatever that means, look at  the redaftables and see how many teams suck at drafting) and the second is you give up good 2nd round picks in 2022. But whatever Cleveland, you just got essentially got the 17+22+30th pick into the draft + cap relief for Kevin Love get over yourself, you did good kid.

Boston:

Here's the second hardest to convince of this trade. My only rational for Boston to go all in for Embiid is just that. Embiid is no doubt a DPOY + MVP talent, he's 26 and if you pair him with Tatum, Brown, Kemba and smart, they are easily a title favorite for quite some time. Embiid is a most likely the game changer that Ainge hoped Kyrie was supposed to be. He is a bully on  offense and terrifying on defense. He is worth the price of admission when you can pair him with this C's club.
Yeah Hayward and 5 picks is steep but you get to have two first team All NBA talents on your roster and you can complement them with Brown and Kemba then smart ehomis arguably All-Defense. Here's Boston's future, they at some point have to reconcile with the fact that Giannis, KD, Embiid, and Butler roam the east and it's not going to be easy to make it to the finals. Wouldn't they be better suited to combat those guys with one of those guys?
Additionally, I'd understand not wanting to give up 5 firsts (even though three of which are in this draft) you could convince me that 4 picks would get the deal done.

Philadelphia:

Also a pretty easy one to convince, the Sixers were/are on an exciting path where it is becoming more and more obvious that either you stick with Ben or Joel. In this case you build around the playmaker and trade embiid because he's more liquid (tradable) and his value is obvious and it's easier to fit embiid into a lot of teams. Why do the Sixers do it? They are already financially committed to an all-in strategy. But it's obvious that this iteration of all-in isn't a championship all-in, it's more of a all-in to see what KD, Giannis, and Tatum can do for the next 1-3 years. This trade allows them to get a stud in CJ who can take the crunch time shots, and Hayward who is vastly over paid but would probably thrive in this role as he's Ben's second option and make no mistake Gordon doesn't suck it's just he's kind of the Bledsoe to Tatum's Brady ( make sense?). Either way you slice it, that teams salary is a sunk cost and I rather spend all that money on Ben+CJ+Hayward+J.richardson+Horford and give the offense a chance.

I'd like to question this by suggesting that Curry is at least a minor positive on the defensive end of the floor (Maybe even a moderate positive, but I could be getting ahead of myself here. You tell me!)

First things first, Curry does struggle in some 1v1 situations, I'll grant that. He's small and not terribly athletic by NBA standards, and these physical limitations bar him from ever being an exceptional 1v1 defender. That said, even in this area, which is where he struggles the most defensively, I really don't think he's that bad. He positions himself well, frequently does a good job staying in front of his man, does a good job leading his man into the other defenders on his team, and has great reflexes/timing. No, he won't lock up the elite point guards in the NBA, but I think that's an unreasonable expectation. Lebron and Giannis and Kawhi and Harden all cook the best defenders in the NBA on a regular basis. I don't think it says that much that Curry can't do a lot to stop Lillard or Kyrie or Westbrook from going off -- very few players can. Against average or slightly-above-average offensive point guards, Curry certainly holds his own defensively, even in pure 1v1 situations.

As an aside, he's stronger than he looks. No, he's obviously not going to battle with a PF or Center in the post, but he's not as flimsy as a lot of people make him out to be. He does a solid job putting pressure on players around his size or even an inch or two taller than him. He's a great rebounder for his size and position, which, by the way, is a very important part of defense, an area where he is a strong positive, and is something that his deceptive strength (alongside good positioning and good timing) allows him to be considerably above-average at. He's had more playoff games where he's outrebounded the opposing centers than his opponents would like to admit.

And I'd argue that he's a huge positive when it comes to off-ball and team defense. He has fantastic BBIQ, very consistently makes the right read, and is almost never out of position. He fits seamlessly into GSW's switching defense, plays solid help defense when he's in a position to, and is great at intercepting passing lanes. He knows how to use help from others when he's switched onto an elite wing (Harden or Kawhi, for instance) or a big who's much stronger than him. When help comes, he is very fast at rotating onto the open man and staying in the passing lane in the meantime so that the forced rotation can't be exploited. Golden State, when they're at their best, runs a very complex defense, and Curry is a valuable part of that. He knows his role and executes it well. And I want to bring this up again because it's a very important part of team defense: Curry is a really good rebounder! He's great at sneaking into a great position to get a hand on the ball and secure the board himself or tap it to another teammate. His timing is fantastic too. Yes, there are plenty of more athletic point guards out there, but very few players at his position have the reflexes and BBIQ to play the role he does in Golden State's defense.

One common criticism of his defense is that, especially in the playoffs, opponents regularly switch their better players onto him and try to target him on defense. This is such a silly criticism to me. Obviously, when the other players on his team are (were) Klay, Draymond, Iguodala, and KD, he's going to be the weak link when it comes to 1v1 defense. This says a lot more about his teammates than it does about him.

I think his absurd production and impact on the offensive end make his defense look a lot worse by comparison, and it is a lot worse *by comparison*, but that doesn't make him a terrible defender by any means. People are not, historically, used to a player his size being the offensive juggernaut he is, so they use that uncharacteristically small size (uncharacteristic by superstar standards, that is) to extrapolate that be must be a negative on defense without really closely watching him play.

In summation, Curry is solid, though far from exceptional at 1v1 defense, making up for his physical limitations with good positioning and reflexes; he's a great rebounder, which is too often a criminally underrated aspect of good defense; and he's an excellent team/off-ball defender, fitting seamlessly into the complex and very effective defensive scheme that Golden State ran over their recent championship run. Considering all of this, it seems clear to me that he is AT LEAST a minor positive on the defensive end of the floor, and, depending on his teammates, may well have an even greater impact than that.

PG: Lebron James

- Now most people would have chosen Magic Johnson for this guard because of his IQ, vision, passing ability, and height. Lebron has all of that and makes his team better just like Magic Johnson, but Magic Johnson does it more efficiently. If you’re asking Lebron and Magic to do this offensively, they will both come out and execute it, that being said Magic would do it a little better. Putting that all aside I chose Lebron because he’s more flexible, if all you’re asking is to pass and make your teammates better Lebron has that covered. Lebron kicks it out to Shaq (Any center), Shaq gets doubled, kicks out to Lebron...... He has a better shot at making that 3 pointer then Magic. He’s a better shooter and he’s more flexible offensively. 

SG: Michael Jordan

- I thought SG was obvious, MJ! We all know what he can do defensively, so we won’t speak that much on it and the mentality he brings onto the table. Offensively I don’t see nobody stopping him at all. MJ has the ball, he posts up, people come in for the DT he can kick that out to Lebron for a good 3. If Lebron isn’t feeling it that’s where we lead to our SF.

SF: Kevin Durant

- KD is probably the most versatile player in the NBA. If you want a 3 for him, you got it. Layup/dunk packages, you got it. Mid range pull ups, you got it. Post moves you got it. He’s a 7’0 player moving like a 6’2 guard and I believe he would adapt well with tough defenders on him. KD defense is also up there as well, without all the picks and stuff (even though it’s part of the game). If you’re asking him to check players and play defense on iso, he will do that just fine. I guarantee if this lists plays another fantasy all-time starting 5, it’s going to be competitive so there won’t be as much screens, picks, etc then what we usually see. What I see a lot about All-star teams is it’s not flexible and stiff, not with this team.

PF: Hakeem

-I’m going to be straight up, I hardly watched any highlights of him. But this time I watched one of his highlights and he’s a perfect PF. The reason why he isn’t a center is because he can easily go down to his post form the 3 and start doing his shakes without screen, or switches. He’s very light on his feet, and quick. I thought that we needed a defense player, someone that plays smart just like Hakeem. We also all know that he’s going to use his brains offensively and defensively. Again I see nobody stoping his dream shakes on an iso, with the double team coming kicking that out to MJ, KD, and LBJ with a easy 3. The thing about this list is no matter how much picks they set, we all know that these players can play defense on anybody. The only issue is probably lebron defensively, but he’s not all that bad once his mind is set to ACTUALLY PLAY. He didn’t even play bad on the last 2 of those clippers and bucks game. 

C: Kareem

- Nobody is stopping his skyhooks other then Wilt chamberlain. The thing is people wouldn’t even take Wilt, they would’ve taken Shaq. I get it... Big boy, strong boy, ya ya ya. So you are telling me that a Wilt Chamberlain that has a 45+ inch vertical and is the same exact height as Shaq, couldn’t even block most of Kareem shot, let alone stop it. Then we have shaq, has a vert of 38 or less and would be a lot slower then wilt. So how is he gonna check Kareem Sky hook? Sure Kareem would still have a little trouble checking shaq, but I’d take Kareem scoring easier on shaq, then shaq scoring on Kareem.

Since Ben Gordon did it for the Bulls in the 2004-05 season, only Lou Williams in 2014-15, the year he spent on the Toronto Raptors, has won the NBA’s 6th Man of the Year award while being ranked outside the top 5 on his team in minutes per game (both Gordon and Williams finished 7th on their team in mpg, respectively) 

This discrepancy indicates the need for a new criterion for determining the 6th Man of the Year. 

The following table measures each team’s 6th ranked player in minutes per game by the percentage of games that player started for the 2018-19 season: (see table 1) https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zfrfXrCLVbzRzWPsm7WsRC2OCOHSCef16Nh4pFP9SDE/edit?usp=sharing

Table 1 shows that the majority of teams’ 6th ranked players in minutes per game were at least occasional starters, rather than designated reserves. In fact, of the players who finished 6th on their team in mpg, only Domantas Sabonis and Terrence Ross garnered any attention for the 6th Man award among league voters. 

The reason for this can be found in the next table which measures each team’s highest-ranked bench player in minutes per game by their team rank in that statistic: (see table 2)
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gSOyFSsVYPWmuntfxqonZUb3NXNEEh8IC-pDUhxeaIc/edit?usp=sharing


As table 2 indicates, the players who received the most votes for the 6th Man of the Year, such as Lou Williams, Spencer Dinwiddie, Andre Iguodala, Dennis Schroder, and Dwyane Wade in his final season finished in the top 5 on their teams in minutes per game. 

Regularly, 6th Man award winners such as Williams, Eric Gordon, Jamal Crawford, JR Smith, and James Harden play starters’ minutes off the bench for contending teams, typically finishing the game with the first unit. The data backs it up, and so does the tape. Just go back and watch the 4th quarter highlights from any important Oklahoma City Thunder game from the 2011-12 season and Harden will surely be out there on the court just as Smith will be out there for the Knicks in 2012-13 and so on. 

Certainly, these players’ importance to their teams is paramount both as to why their coaches put them in with the starters in critical situations, and as to why they continually pick up the 6th Man hardware at the end of the year. However, it begs the question: are they truly the 6th man if they’re clearly one of the top few, or at the very least the top five players on their team?

Maybe the 6th man award should go to a player who gets his minutes with the bench unit; the guy who keeps the team afloat during those often overlooked 2nd and 3rd quarter stretches when the stars need to rest, and who inevitably ends up cheering his team on from the sidelines in the final seconds.

Take a look again at the first table at guys like Sabonis, Ross, Jaylen Brown, Demarre Carroll, Monte Morris, Kevon Looney, Dario Saric, Patty Mills, Serge Ibaka, or Thomas Bryant, all of whom, regardless of how many seconds have elapsed (if any) when they first check into the game, have their role as the 6th best player on their team cemented by playing 6th most minutes per game. Maybe these are the guys who should be in line for the 6th Man of the Year award instead of the never-ending conveyor belt of pseudo-starter combo guards who win it year after year.

With Williams, Gordon, Crawford, Smith, and Harden you can account for 9 out of the last 10 6th Man awards. You also have a pretty obvious typeset for which players are going to win the award year in and year out. Only Lamar Odom stands out as unique among the last decade’s winners. Most likely, the league need only await the next amalgamation of a high-scoring combo guard to take the place of Lou Williams as the perennial 6th Man of the Year winner. That is, unless a new method was installed to give a broader range of players a shot at it. 

The players listed in table 1 cover a wider array of archetypes than the typical 6th Man winners, with a slight tendency towards multi-positional wing players following the trend of the NBA as a whole. If you transfer the data found in the table from the 2018-19 to the incomplete 2019-20 campaign, and narrow in on the league’s best Milwaukee Bucks as an example, the player most closely associated with the averages of 39.3% of games started and 23.9 minutes per game would be Donte DiVincenzo who started 37.3 percent of the games he played in at an average of 23.1 minutes per game prior to the suspension of the season. Now, how’s that for a change of pace 6th Man of the Year candidate? 

Not convinced? Fine. Maybe that one is a long shot. In fact, based on the NBA’s current criteria for the award, DiVincenzo would qualify for consideration simply for having started fewer than half his games, and it’s hard to imagine a player averaging just under 10 points per game picking up the trophy when compared against the gaudy scoring numbers put up by Williams and company. But if instead, the criteria for the award was simply having the 6th most minutes per game on your team, all the sudden most of the repetitive top candidates would be disqualified, and the path for a really exciting, fun, underrated player like DiVincenzo to grab a little recognition would get a whole lot clearer.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,82145,public,self,"Sorry Lou Will, but the 6th man of the year should be the 6th man on the team...",0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/g0v2fc/sorry_lou_will_but_the_6th_man_of_the_year_should/,some_ads,7,,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'jZbLEwVNn05I35bBaQiSeUKVk2ge5xxJ2VCpw39iC5U', 'resolutions': [{'height': 56, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/6RnDIrcxa_7ssEnU7cWXhh83Vf0-aX8HV5fNnMMJeck.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7eec5eb35d1cf0cbe0299eafe6a053d2a250ff02', 'width': 108}, {'height': 113, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/6RnDIrcxa_7ssEnU7cWXhh83Vf0-aX8HV5fNnMMJeck.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa3d8bebceed0c38313745ed01609032f6fde48c', 'width': 216}, {'height': 168, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/6RnDIrcxa_7ssEnU7cWXhh83Vf0-aX8HV5fNnMMJeck.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e97c14de725f7a44464b8bb76507331d741979ff', 'width': 320}, {'height': 336, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/6RnDIrcxa_7ssEnU7cWXhh83Vf0-aX8HV5fNnMMJeck.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e7e94bb9f36a72716ae922f56c690c2dd0ec4ba', 'width': 640}, {'height': 504, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/6RnDIrcxa_7ssEnU7cWXhh83Vf0-aX8HV5fNnMMJeck.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=303ed2d5d42037ba17658349ccfd4e93bb4902d9', 'width': 960}, {'height': 567, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/6RnDIrcxa_7ssEnU7cWXhh83Vf0-aX8HV5fNnMMJeck.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43ffa629c5f2c0e08b4761e4e603778600076cac', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 630, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/6RnDIrcxa_7ssEnU7cWXhh83Vf0-aX8HV5fNnMMJeck.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=5494a8bdd7bc875a475a7ac50cdd0968478025ba', 'width': 1200}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,

What is your franchise's all-time fan-approval or fan-favourite team? These players need not be the top-tier contributors in your franchise's history, we've got plenty of lists for that!

**Toronto Raptors**

**PG:  Alvin Williams (1998-2006)**

*(9.1 PPG | 4.1 APG | 1.2 SPG)*

**Reason:** Williams is one of the longest tenured Raptors. He famously hit the jumper that won the Toronto Raptors' first-ever playoff series (against the New York Knicks). Williams was out of the limelight with the likes of Vince Carter flying high. However it was Williams' responsibility to guard the best backcourt player on top of initiate the offence. Williams' career was cut short due to significant injuries that he attempted to play through, but eventually derailed his career. Now an occasional analyst for the Raptors during the playoffs, Williams always gets a loud hand when he returns to Toronto.

**SG: Lou Williams (2014-2015)**

*(15.5 PPG | 2.1 APG | 1.1 SPG)*

**Reason:** I think every team loved Lou Williams if he was on it. However the absolute f\*cking legend that is Lou Williams only really came into popular consciousness when Lou was with the Raptors. Lou would pull up and score from anywhere, not play a lick of defence, and go on to win the Sixth Man of the Year award (his first of many). The man publicly had TWO girlfriends and even had a Drake song named after him. Raptors fans excitedly yelled ""LOOOOOUUUUU"" in unison anytime he touched the ball.

**SF: Morris Peterson (2000-2007)**

*(12.0 PPG | 3.8 RPG | .371 3P%)*

**Reason:** Mo-Pete will always be a legend in the eyes of Toronto Raptors fans. Sticking with the team through, at the time, their best years and their worst, Peterson was as loyal as they come. Famed for bulldog defence, circus shots, buzzer beaters, and slapping Vince Carter in the face in his return to Toronto, Mo-Pete's name is in the mind of every Raptors fan.

**PF: Jerome Williams (2000-2004)**

*(7.5 PPG | 7.1 RPG | 1.3 SPG)*

**Reason:** Is there a team that Williams has been on that doesn't absolutely adore the ""Junkyard Dog""? Always playing toward the crowd, doing the dirty work, and getting on the floor, JYD endeared himself to fans quickly. He famously drove through a blizzard from Detroit to Toronto after he was dealt, against the wishes of his GM and coach, in order to get settled as quickly as possible. Williams continues to do charitable work for the Toronto Raptors to this day.

**C: Jonas Valanciunas (2012-2019)**

*(12.1 PPG | 8.5 RPG | 1.0 BPG)*

**Reason:** Valanciunas is one of the few players that was truly loyal to the Toronto Raptors. Coming in from Lithuania after a stash year, Raptors fans saw an awkward, skinny, 20 year old with poor English and Borat jokes grow to become a bearded grinder with a surprising touch, slightly better English, and the same Borat jokes. His trade to the Memphis Grizzlies for Marc Gasol was a hard blow, but that didn't stop him from watching his old team from their own tunnel during Game 1 of their eventual playoff run.

There can be no overlap in the years each player was with the your team. Also, this only counts the years each player actually played for  your team (example: no  prime Shaq on the Suns).

I'm a Suns fan, so here's mine to give you an idea:

**PHOENIX SUNS**

**PG:  Steve Nash (2004-05 - 2011-12)**  
*Stats:  14.4 ppg, 3.1 rpg, 9.4 apg, 50.4% fg, 43.5% 3fg*  
***Reasoning:***  Nash is the greatest Sun of all time, in my opinion. Back-to-back   MVP's, most fun team to watch, just an amazing time to be a Suns fan. He made all of his teammates better, so it would also be interesting to see how much better he could make the other guys on this team.

**SG:  Devin Booker (2015-16 - Present)**  
*Stats:  22.3 ppg, 3.6 rpg, 4.7 apg, 48.7% fg, 36.0% 3fg*  
***Reasoning:***  Yes, the defense in the back court would be really bad, but it would be incredible to see what Booker could do with Nash as his point guard. The scoring/shooting would be phenomenal between these two. Booker is also an easy choice because he hasn't played with any other Suns  greats.

**SF:  Connie Hawkins (1969-70 - 1973-74)**  
*Stats:  20.5 ppg, 9.0 rpg, 4.3 apg, 46.6% fg, n/a 3fg*  
***Reasoning:***  Hawkins only played on the Suns for four seasons so it's easy to fit him in here without any overlap, but he is also worthy of being on the all-time team. Hawkins was a dominant offensive force, was an incredible  rebounder, and a really good passer. Having Nash-Booker-Hawkins  together on the court would allow for some of the  best ball movement and  playmaking in the league. A slam-dunk champion  running alongside Nash would be extremely fun to watch and it's hard to  pass up an All-NBA First Team selection here.

**PF:  Charles Barkley (1992-93 - 1995-96)**  
*Stats:  23.4 ppg, 11.5 rpg, 4.4 apg, 50.1% fg, 30.1% 3fg*  
***Reasoning:***  Although Barkley only spent four seasons in Phoenix he is a Suns legend and an MVP. Barkley wasn't a great shooter but he dominated in so many ways that it wouldn't matter. His passing would be valuable to kick out to Nash or Booker on the perimeter when double-teamed or he could just take it inside by himself.

**C:  Larry Nance (1981-82 - 1987-88)**  
*Stats:  17.3 ppg, 7.8 rpg, 2.6 apg, 56.1% fg, 16.1% 3fg*  
***Reasoning:***  His numbers are brought down a bit by his rookie season, but Nance  was  a solid 20/8 player most of his time in Phoenix. All all-defense  level  player would be a great to have inside to help some of the poorer defenders on this team. He also won the dunk contest, which would make   him a great partner with Nash. At this point it was harder to get   players who weren't teammates so Nance just made the most sense.

**6:  Paul Westphal (1975-76 - 1979-80)**  
*Stats:  20.6 ppg, 2.2 rpg, 5.2 apg, 51.6% fg, 27.7% 3fg*  
***Reasoning:***    Westphal was an incredible scorer, leader, and good rebounder for his position. Having an NBA champion on this team and a guy who took us to the Finals is extremely valuable plus he brings confidence and efficiency off the bench.

**Conclusion:**  Overall,   I really like this team. With Nash running alongside two dunk champions  plus Booker and Barkley they would easily be the most  entertaining team in the league and would run most teams out of the gym. The main issues are defense and shooting, but I think those could be covered up by superior rebounding and athleticism and overall scoring  ability and talent. Having five players who averaged at least 4 assists  per game while on the Suns would also create a lot more open looks and  hopefully increase shooting percentages. I  also think the players would  be more efficient from three with Nash feeding them the ball.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,82101,public,self,Your Franchise's All-Time Team (No Teammates Allowed),1,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/g0nv0l/your_franchises_alltime_team_no_teammates_allowed/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So far I have:

1. MJ: The absolute best package of accolades, winning, and peak performance. 
2. Lebron: Will probably dominate the career totals leaderboards by the end of his career. Insanely long period of dominance, he's been a star for longer than MJ has played. But I don't think his peak is quite up there with MJ. But he certainly has a case for the GOAT
3. Kareem: The single most well-decorated player in terms of accolades. I think there's a strong argument for Kareem to be the GOAT considering just how consistent he was, how dominant and efficient he was relative to his peers, and how many accolades he has. Longevity plays a factor here as well

Things I value strongly(In rough order): Peak years, dominance relative to peers, accolades, playoff performances, length of peak, length of prime

Yes, we struggled this season, mainly on the defensive end, but I think a solid offseason and continued development from our youth can help offset these issues. To be clear, I’m not talking about making drastic moves in this hypothetical such as trading for Gobert (a move I adamantly oppose), but merely smart decisions in the draft and in the coming free agency. Before making any of the moves, however, here is my current (albeit one very positive) outlook on the roster:\n\n***Tier 1: Our big three***\n\nBeal: The star of the show, a great centerpiece for our rebuild, and IMO the best guard in the east\n\nWall: Potentially, the perfect secondary piece for the team, someone who can hit big shots and still drop 10+ assist, I am HYPED for his return and the reports about him [dominating](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/rehabbing-john-wall-was-playing-the-way-he-was-playing-before-the-injuries/) in the g-league only bolstered that.\n\nBertans: Imagine a supersized JJ Reddick, that\'s what Bertans is, as well as the team\'s current 3rd ‘star’, Bertans can drop 30 any given night if his shot is clicking. He keeps the defense moving and opens up driving lanes, I think Wall will be the perfect point guard for him. The biggest move this offseason for Tommy is re-signing him.\n\n***Tier 2: Highest ceiling young guys***\n\nTroy Brown: I am all aboard the Troy Brown train, although I will admit I was skeptical at first. Think about it, Brown is 6\'6\'\', has a point guard like handle, very high bbiq, is a good defender, and has a smooth, well-rounded game in general... and he is only 20. His per/40 stats are promising as well with him averaging 15.6 points, 8.6 boards, and 3.4 assists for this season. I think he can bud into a really useful player.\n\nRui Hachimura: He has shown out this season and has had arguably the 3rd-6th best rookie season of this year. If he improves his handle and 3-pt shooting he will be very hard to contain.\n\nIsaac Bonga: An athletic specimen, who has shown very high defensive potential and versatility, Bonga has greatly polished his offensive game as well. He also has some guard like qualities and is only 20.   I believe he can become (in a few seasons perhaps) a good player as well.\n\n***Tier 3: My favorite role players***\n\nIsh Smith: Ish is arguably the 3rd best backup point in the East (behind Spencer and Rose), and has elite speed and high-level passing and slashing ability. He has actually taken over and won some games for the Wiz almost single-handedly.\n\nShabazz Napier: I really like his game, and he actually plays a lot like Ish. Both of them are solid point guards, and have even shown the ability to share ballhandling duties, so having both on the roster in the future isn\'t out of the question.\n\nGary Payton II: He plays good defense, is capable offensively, and likely will be very cheap. He can be our Royce O\'Neal or Pat Bev moving forward. I see no reason not to keep him.\n\nGarrison Matthews: A good shooter, who has shown that he\'s also a solid defender, Garrison is a good 3&amp;D that we should keep around.\n\nAP: Tall, cheap, and can shoot, as well as arguably the best rim protector on the squad that isn\'t commander Ian\n\nHonorable mention: Jordan McRae (I hope we bring him back)\n\n***Tier 4: The biggest question marks (our centers basically)***\n\nMo Wagner/Thomas Bryant: Two bigs with very similar skillsets and who both struggle greatly when on the defensive end or rebounding, and while they are both young and have shown offensive promise, it\'s hard to see a team where both of them are major players advance in the playoffs. Guys like Giannis, Bam, and Embiid would have a field day on them. I hope they can improve, but I know we will be looking at some bigs in the draft and free agency. (I am not scapegoating them for our lack of success this season, I just note that we need some improvement in multiple categories that they lack in)\n\nAdmiral Schofield: I hope Scho becomes our PJ Tucker, he has the build and athleticism, however, his offensive game needs a lot of improvement.\n\nCommander Ian: Not going to lie, sometimes this season it looked like Ian was the best center on the roster since he could actually body up with the bigger and more athletic bigs, however many question marks remain around him and his contract surely doesn\'t improve our view of him.\n\nJerome Robinson: He\'s young, long, a solid defender, and displays a good shooting form, what\'s holding him back from being the player the Clippers thought they had drafted? That part is unknown. However, the Wizards might be the fresh start he needs to get things moving.\n\n**It starts with the draft, we have two main holes in our lineup, one at small forward and another at the center spot. I feel addressing the SF spot in the draft makes more sense than any other move because:**\n\n1. This draft class is much deeper with 3&amp;D forwards than it is with centers (I’m really only high on Onyeka)\n2. This year’s free agency class has some promising prospects at the center spot (which I will discuss later) that would greatly improve our team.\n\nWith that in mind, here are some of the prospects we should consider (in order of favorite):\n\n*Saddiq Bey (Villanova Sophmore)*\n\n**Stats**:\n\n**PTS**: 16.1\n\n**TRB**: 4.7\n\n**AST**: 2.4\n\n**FG%**: 48\n\n**FG3%**: 45\n\n**FT%**: 77\n\n*Advanced Stats*:\n\n**eFG%**: 58\n\n**PER**: 22\n\n**WS**: 4.9\n\n**TS%**: 61\n\n***Measurements: 6’8’’/216 Ibs/wingspan: 6’10’’/standing reach: 8’7’’***\n\nMy brief assessment:\n\nSaddiq Bey, my favorite prospect for the Wizards might be a bit unheard of by many, but he, in my opinion, is the best realistic option for us. He shot a ridiculous 45% from deep on the vaunted college three-point line, has terrific length, defensive versatility, has the discipline endowed to all those under Jay Wright, and good athleticism. Read [this](https://collegebasketball.nbcsports.com/2020/04/07/saddiq-bey-2020-nba-draft-propsect-breakdown/)\n\nI think he could contribute immediately for the Wiz and would help space the floor and defend greatly, also a bonus, he grew up in Maryland, so that possibly could help when negotiating new contracts.\n\nHighlight Video: [https://youtu.be/YIIjG8Xeg](https://youtu.be/YIIjG8Xeg)\n\nScouting Video: [https://youtu.be/GsoyP9N-N2A](https://youtu.be/GsoyP9N-N2A)\n\n*Devin Vassell (Florida State Sophomore)*\n\n**Stats**:\n\n**PTS**: 12.7\n\n**TRB**: 5.1\n\n**AST**: 1.6\n\n**FG%**: 49\n\n**FG3%**:42\n\n**FT%**:74\n\n*Advanced Stats*:\n\n**eFG%**: 57\n\n**PER**: 24.25\n\n**WS**: 4.7\n\n**TS%**: 59\n\n***Measurements: 6’6’’/194 lbs/wingspan: 6’9.25’’/standing reach: NA***\n\nBrief assessment: A high-level 3&amp;D wing with good versatility defensively and a good stroke. A very promising player as well, I wouldn’t be opposed to drafting him at all as I believe he would help this team.\n\nHighlights video: https://youtu.be/GIYx2X0Rpw8\n\nScouting video: https://youtu.be/NrfhjfxhZ_g\n\n*Isaac Okoro (Auburn Freshman)*\n\nStats:\n\n**PTS**: 12.9\n\n**TRB**: 4.4\n\n**AST**: 2.0\n\n**FG%**: 51.4\n\n**FG3%**: 29.0\n\n**FT%**: 67.2\n\n*Advanced Stats*:\n\n**eFG%**: 55.6\n\n**PER**: 19.2\n\n**WS**: 3.4\n\n**TS%**:\n\n***Measurements: 6\'6\'\'/225 lbs/ Wingspan: 6\'8.5""/Standing Reach: 8\'4.5""***\n\nMy Brief Summary Of The Player:\n\nPerhaps the most versatile defensive player in this draft, Okoro brings NBA ready defense and solid 3&amp;D potential. While he might need a bit of polish, I think he would be a dependable prospect for the Wiz to bring in.\n\nHighlight Video:[ https://youtu.be/YZgmUrH8ev4](https://youtu.be/YZgmUrH8ev4)\n\nScouting Video:[ https://youtu.be/SUMrHvjtSdU](https://youtu.be/SUMrHvjtSdU)\n\n*Deni Avdija (Overseas Euroleague: Maccabi Tel-Aviv/19 years old)*\n\n**Stats Per 36 Minutes**:\n\n**PTS**: 10.2\n\n**TRB**: 6.6\n\n**AST**: 2.9\n\n**FG%**: 44\n\n**FG3%**: 28\n\n**FT%**: 56\n\n***Measurements: 6\'9\'\'/ 219 lbs/Wingspan: 6\'9\'\'/Standing Reach: NA***\n\nMy Brief Summary Of The Player:\n\nA very polished player, that will benefit from his experience in the Euroleague. His shot has good potential and his handle and passing are very accomplished relative to the average forward. He possesses defensive potential but can struggle when covering those more athletic. I like him as a player, however, we do need an infusion of defense.\n\nHighlight Video:[ https://youtu.be/MIRh\\_bOhMks](https://youtu.be/MIRh_bOhMks)\n\nScouting Video:[ https://youtu.be/NeiTEn0Q37U](https://youtu.be/NeiTEn0Q37U)\n\n**Honorable Mention:**\n\n*Aaron Nesmith  (Vanderbilt Sophomore)*\n\n**After drafting Bey, we move onto free agency looking to address the center spot and there plenty of candidates.**\n\n***The ‘probably out of our price ranges’ tier***\n\n**Christian Wood**\n\nIn such a weak free-agent class, Wood could potentially be very well compensated this season, however, if we can get him for something near reasonable, I\'d go for it. He\'s the perfect big man, well rounded, young, and, get this, can play good defense. He is a potential future Allstar and would be an excellent infusion of young talent to this team. He would give us excellent floor spacing, improve our already high-powered offense, and bring much-needed reinforcement on the other end.\n\n**Aron Baynes**\n\nBaynes is looking more and more like a high-level center. He is a top tier defender, hardnosed rebounder, excellent pick-setter, has a soft touch around the rim, and has shown potential shooting it from deep. He probably will be out of our price range but would pair well with our squad.\n\n***The ‘somewhat expensive’ tier***\n\n**Derrick Favors**\n\nFavors brings consistency, leadership, floor-spacing, and defense. While he doesn\'t have the ceiling of Wood, he could potentially be a more seamless and immediate fit. He is one of my favorite prospects on this list. Bonus, he\'s only 28.\n\n**Serve Ibaka**\n\nSerge is having a career year, he\'s hitting threes and swatting shots on the other end at a high rate. He would improve our squad on both ends of the court and is still well within his prime. The only reason he isn\'t higher is that he is more of a combo PF.\n\n***The ‘MLE targets/minimum deals’ tier***\n\n**Nerlens Noel**\n\nHe’s an elite shot-blocker, sound rebounder, good pick setter, and a great athlete and shouldn’t be too expensive, an ideal fit for this squad, what’s not to like?\n\n**Jahlil Okafor**\n\nA reliable talent that brings solid play on the offensive end although he doesn\'t really give us that much of an upgrade on the defensive end. He’s also very young so that’s a plus.\n\n**Javale McGee**\n\nWe know what we\'ll get with McGee, Deandre Jordan lite. A long, capable rim protector and a dependable rebounder. He probably will stay with the Lakers, but deserves a look.\n\n**Mason Plumlee**\n\nA cheap add that would help address some of our defensive problems, however, he alone will not be enough.\n\n**Hassan Whiteside**\n\nHe\'s not as quick as Tristan Thompson but is much bigger. He can block shots and finish around the hoop, and while he can be a bit slow on defense at times, he would be a sure upgrade over our current situation. I wouldn’t be stoked if the Wizards got him unless we offer something reasonable.\n\n**Marc Gasol**\n\nGasol is old and he probably will look to contend his last couple of years in the league, but he still is a very good defender, excellent pick and popper, and a great passer. He would be a steadfast addition if the Wizards believe they can make some noise in the East next season.\n\n**Demarcus Cousins**\n\nAn enormous question mark from an attitude standpoint, not to mention health and legal (I believe the charges from his ex were dropped so that might have been fake) standpoint as well. However, his upside is incredibly high as only two years ago he was considered an apex big man in the league.\n\n**I would love to see us add Favors with some of Ian’s money coming off the books and knab Nerlens with the MLE.**\n\nAt this point in this hypothetical, we have Saddiq Bey, a promising 3&amp;D wing, Favors, a starting-caliber center that brings solid floor spacing, defense, and rebounding, and Noel, our athletic, defensive specialist. Those three players alone, I believe will really help upgrade this team.\n\nThen, it’s onto our expiring contracts and of the mix (Bertans, Shabazz, Matthews, and Ian), I see only Davis as a priority signing and try and sign him for around 8-11 million from the hard cap. Re-signing Matthews really should only require a minimum contract and we might as well do so as well. At this point, we have overloaded our roster with frontcourt pieces and trading either Thomas Bryant or Mo Wagner seems inevitable. In this hypothetical, we keep Wagner as he can play both the 4 and 5 (therefore more versatile) and get rid of Bryant for maybe a future second-rounder since there probably isn\'t much of a market for him.\n\nIdeally, we roll into next season with a team of:\n\n**Wall/Ish/GPII**\n\n*A speedy pairing (Wall and Ish) with Payton to play a few minutes for defense*\n\n**Beal/Matthews/Jrob**\n\n*A solid shooting trio, led by superstar Bradley Beal*\n\n**Troy/Bey/Bonga**\n\n*Troy brings another ballhandler to the lineup, Bey brings a two-way skill set and versatility, while Bonga brings potential, length, and defense*\n\n**Rui/Bertans/Wagner**\n\n*Rui gives us reliable play, Bertans is our off the bench spark, and Wagner plays a few minutes in between*\n\n**Favors/Nerlens/AP**\n\n*A solid defensive and rebounding trio, exactly what the Wiz need, Favors and AP’s shooting and floor spacing is a bonus as well.*\n\n**Plus: Admiral and our hypothetical second-rounder (say, Ashton Hagans for even more defense)**\n\nI actually think this team would match up really well with some of the top tier teams in the East and could end up competing for a spot in the ECF (...or deeper?), we would have added plenty of consistent rebounders and defensive players, addressing our biggest issue. Have added a healthy Wall, solidifying our ‘big three’. And really have improved in all other aspects such as passing, depth, speed, and floor spacing.\n\nEdit: Go Wiz! Thanks for the silver!', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually think the Wizards are in a good position for the coming years. Yes, we struggled this season, mainly on the defensive end, but I think a solid offseason and continued development from our youth can help offset these issues. To be clear, I’m not talking about making drastic moves in this hypothetical such as trading for Gobert (a move I adamantly oppose), but merely smart decisions in the draft and in the coming free agency. Before making any of the moves, however, here is my current (albeit one very positive) outlook on the roster:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tier 1: Our big three&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beal: The star of the show, a great centerpiece for our rebuild, and IMO the best guard in the east&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wall: Potentially, the perfect secondary piece for the team, someone who can hit big shots and still drop 10+ assist, I am HYPED for his return and the reports about him &lt;a href=""https://www.slamonline.com/nba/rehabbing-john-wall-was-playing-the-way-he-was-playing-before-the-injuries/""&gt;dominating&lt;/a&gt; in the g-league only bolstered that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bertans: Imagine a supersized JJ Reddick, that&amp;#39;s what Bertans is, as well as the team&amp;#39;s current 3rd ‘star’, Bertans can drop 30 any given night if his shot is clicking. He keeps the defense moving and opens up driving lanes, I think Wall will be the perfect point guard for him. The biggest move this offseason for Tommy is re-signing him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tier 2: Highest ceiling young guys&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Troy Brown: I am all aboard the Troy Brown train, although I will admit I was skeptical at first. Think about it, Brown is 6&amp;#39;6&amp;#39;&amp;#39;, has a point guard like handle, very high bbiq, is a good defender, and has a smooth, well-rounded game in general... and he is only 20. His per/40 stats are promising as well with him averaging 15.6 points, 8.6 boards, and 3.4 assists for this season. I think he can bud into a really useful player.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rui Hachimura: He has shown out this season and has had arguably the 3rd-6th best rookie season of this year. If he improves his handle and 3-pt shooting he will be very hard to contain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Isaac Bonga: An athletic specimen, who has shown very high defensive potential and versatility, Bonga has greatly polished his offensive game as well.

I believe he can become (in a few seasons perhaps) a good player as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tier 3: My favorite role players&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ish Smith: Ish is arguably the 3rd best backup point in the East (behind Spencer and Rose), and has elite speed and high-level passing and slashing ability. He has actually taken over and won some games for the Wiz almost single-handedly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shabazz Napier: I really like his game, and he actually plays a lot like Ish.

His shot has good potential and his handle and passing are very accomplished relative to the average forward. He possesses defensive potential but can struggle when covering those more athletic. I like him as a player, however, we do need an infusion of defense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Highlight Video:&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/MIRh_bOhMks""&gt; https://youtu.be/MIRh_bOhMks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scouting Video:&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/NeiTEn0Q37U""&gt; https://youtu.be/NeiTEn0Q37U&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honorable Mention:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aaron Nesmith  (Vanderbilt Sophomore)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After drafting Bey, we move onto free agency looking to address the center spot and there plenty of candidates.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ‘probably out of our price ranges’ tier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christian Wood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In such a weak free-agent class, Wood could potentially be very well compensated this season, however, if we can get him for something near reasonable, I&amp;#39;d go for it. He&amp;#39;s the perfect big man, well rounded, young, and, get this, can play good defense. He is a potential future Allstar and would be an excellent infusion of young talent to this team. He would give us excellent floor spacing, improve our already high-powered offense, and bring much-needed reinforcement on the other end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aron Baynes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Baynes is looking more and more like a high-level center. He is a top tier defender, hardnosed rebounder, excellent pick-setter, has a soft touch around the rim, and has shown potential shooting it from deep. He probably will be out of our price range but would pair well with our squad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ‘somewhat expensive’ tier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derrick Favors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Favors brings consistency, leadership, floor-spacing, and defense. While he doesn&amp;#39;t have the ceiling of Wood, he could potentially be a more seamless and immediate fit. He is one of my favorite prospects on this list. Bonus, he&amp;#39;s only 28.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serve Ibaka&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Serge is having a career year, he&amp;#39;s hitting threes and swatting shots on the other end at a high rate. He would improve our squad on both ends of the court and is still well within his prime. The only reason he isn&amp;#39;t higher is that he is more of a combo PF.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ‘MLE targets/minimum deals’ tier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nerlens Noel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He’s an elite shot-blocker, sound rebounder, good pick setter, and a great athlete and shouldn’t be too expensive, an ideal fit for this squad, what’s not to like?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jahlil Okafor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A reliable talent that brings solid play on the offensive end although he doesn&amp;#39;t really give us that much of an upgrade on the defensive end. He’s also very young so that’s a plus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Javale McGee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We know what we&amp;#39;ll get with McGee, Deandre Jordan lite. A long, capable rim protector and a dependable rebounder. He probably will stay with the Lakers, but deserves a look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mason Plumlee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A cheap add that would help address some of our defensive problems, however, he alone will not be enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hassan Whiteside&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s not as quick as Tristan Thompson but is much bigger. He can block shots and finish around the hoop, and while he can be a bit slow on defense at times, he would be a sure upgrade over our current situation. I wouldn’t be stoked if the Wizards got him unless we offer something reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marc Gasol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gasol is old and he probably will look to contend his last couple of years in the league, but he still is a very good defender, excellent pick and popper, and a great passer. He would be a steadfast addition if the Wizards believe they can make some noise in the East next season.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demarcus Cousins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An enormous question mark from an attitude standpoint, not to mention health and legal (I believe the charges from his ex were dropped so that might have been fake) standpoint as well. However, his upside is incredibly high as only two years ago he was considered an apex big man in the league.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I would love to see us add Favors with some of Ian’s money coming off the books and knab Nerlens with the MLE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point in this hypothetical, we have Saddiq Bey, a promising 3&amp;amp;D wing, Favors, a starting-caliber center that brings solid floor spacing, defense, and rebounding, and Noel, our athletic, defensive specialist. Those three players alone, I believe will really help upgrade this team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, it’s onto our expiring contracts and of the mix (Bertans, Shabazz, Matthews, and Ian), I see only Davis as a priority signing and try and sign him for around 8-11 million from the hard cap. Re-signing Matthews really should only require a minimum contract and we might as well do so as well. At this point, we have overloaded our roster with frontcourt pieces and trading either Thomas Bryant or Mo Wagner seems inevitable. In this hypothetical, we keep Wagner as he can play both the 4 and 5 (therefore more versatile) and get rid of Bryant for maybe a future second-rounder since there probably isn&amp;#39;t much of a market for him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ideally, we roll into next season with a team of:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wall/Ish/GPII&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A speedy pairing (Wall and Ish) with Payton to play a few minutes for defense&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beal/Matthews/Jrob&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A solid shooting trio, led by superstar Bradley Beal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Troy/Bey/Bonga&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Troy brings another ballhandler to the lineup, Bey brings a two-way skill set and versatility, while Bonga brings potential, length, and defense&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rui/Bertans/Wagner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rui gives us reliable play, Bertans is our off the bench spark, and Wagner plays a few minutes in between&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favors/Nerlens/AP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A solid defensive and rebounding trio, exactly what the Wiz need, Favors and AP’s shooting and floor spacing is a bonus as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plus: Admiral and our hypothetical second-rounder (say, Ashton Hagans for even more defense)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually think this team would match up really well with some of the top tier teams in the East and could end up competing for a spot in the ECF (...or deeper?), we would have added plenty of consistent rebounders and defensive players, addressing our biggest issue. Have added a healthy Wall, solidifying our ‘big three’. And really have improved in all other aspects such as passing, depth, speed, and floor spacing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Go Wiz!

Here's the relevant passage: ""To be sure, point guards are too offensively significant to ever be totally disregarded, but it’s becoming obvious that, in the playoffs at least, small defenders will be ceaselessly targeted until they either acquit themselves well or get benched. Whereas point guards who are switchable (think: Kyle Lowry and his video-vixen butt) or pyromaniac scorers (think: Damian Lillard or Steph Curry) will always have their place, the value of the position’s upper-middle-class might require a total recalibration. Brad Stevens will have to conjure defensive schemes that adequately hide Kemba Walker; the Clippers have already resigned themselves to the fact that Lou Williams will be utterly unplayable in the fourth quarter in the playoffs; the Hawks’ ceiling is capped until Trae Young provides more defense than a colander in a flood. As such, every point guard must confront a common question: Can you produce enough offensive value to justify your defensive weakness?""



Centers have famously been marginalized by small-ball, but small-ball isn't really totally accurate. It's been less of a down-sizing than a same-sizing. There's been a new wave of big playmakers (Luka, Ben Simmons) and the few drafts will have a lot of big guards and playmakers too (Lamelo, Killian Hayes, Cade Cunningham, Ty Haliburton, etc).

I recently commented on a post on r/nba stating that I think KD is/will be the goat offensive player when all is said and done. I got downvoted because of the nature of the comment (it related to MJ - not important).

But it got me thinking, Is there a strong basis to my opinion and what is the general consensus among a knowledgable basketball community here at r/nbadiscussion?

To be clear, my argument is that **Kevin Durant is already a top 3 offensive player of all time**, and has the **potential to be the greatest** by the time he retires.

I understand “best” is hard to define. For example, [DeAndre Jordan has the 3rd highest offensive rating of all time.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/off_rtg_career.html).

With as many pieces there are in the association, as many opportunities that exist to change the context of a story, every small thing matters because if one thing changes, a story can be completely re-written.


Before the start of the 2003-04 season, the Minnesota Timberwolves were preparing to face the music. Their star power forward was entering his peak and having to run a one-man show. 7 play-off appearances had been met with 7 first-round exits. Progress of the franchise had reached a stand-still.


The 2003 play-offs brought a land of opportunity. The wicked witch of the west in the Los Angeles Lakers were dead—or so we thought. The Spurs had provided further evidence that a team could be led through their big man with balance in their guard play — even though Tim Duncan was a center and not a power forward, but got listed as a power forward so everyone thought, ""Damn, power forwards are useful."" But more importantly, the west was wide open. 


Kevin McHale and a newly promoted Rob Babcock would proceed to make the moves to build around Kevin Garnett in the best way possible — a valuable backcourt. 


Sam Cassell would leave the big three in Milwaukee to create a new big three in Minnesota, where his talents as a seasoned lead guard would be appreciated by the team and the NBA media as he would be voted to the All-NBA Second Team and voted into the 2004 NBA All-Star Game for the first and only time of his career.


The term swingman could be used to describe many aspects of Latrell Sprewell—his style of play, his personality. A man whose antics made Gilbert Arenas look like a saint would complete the highest scoring trio of that year—meshing well with this co-stars even if only for the year.


Key role-player additions — Fred Hoiberg, Michael Olowokandi, Trenton Hassell — would round out a roster, providing key role-player minutes and versatility.


McHale had done everything right. 


Flip Saunders had a lot of assets to work with and needed to create an offensive system that would highlight the individual talent while also producing team chemistry and limiting solo performances.


His take on an isolation game was the perfect fit — allowing for Sam Cassell to run the offense, Kevin Garnett to space the floor while also getting offensive looks wherever and whenever. The floor spacing wouldn’t create looks around the perimeter for the team — who would have the 5th lowest amount of three point attempts. Instead, it would create drive opportunities, isolation on the wing and more importantly, good looks at the basket. The Wolves would had their shots blocked the least amount of teams in the NBA that year, 6th in assists and would have the 2nd best field goal percentage.


In reality, the focus of the team’s powers would come of the defensive end. Garnett at the four allowed for flexibility as a defender — being able to move around the floor without much limitation. Meanwhile, the Timberwolves guards would be feisty defenders, disrupting the offensive flow. The Wolves would rank 2nd in forced turnovers, 7th in blocks and a solid 3rd in total rebounds. Teams would only shoot 41% against them and more importantly, every miss felt like a disaster — as the Wolves could sprint down the floor right into an offensive scenario of their liking.


Despite the slow start, as the team was a completely re-modeled, the team deserved to be the best in the west and Kevin Garnett deserved the recognition as the most valuable player. He was a walking double-double that always produced a threat of being a walking triple-double with his passing—even if he only managed to produce 2 triple-doubles. He would not have a game with less than 10 points, he would have 12 30+ points games, he was simply incredible that year.


When the play-offs came around, there was still skepticism. Their history of early exits were tough to swallow. But, they would luck out with how the cards fell. They have to go through a first-year stud in Carmelo Anthony and more than likely face the dangerous Sacramento Kings. But being able to avoid San Antonio and Los Angeles for 2 rounds was important — it gave them hope. 

--

Playing against Denver felt like playing against the unknown. The team hadn’t made the plays since 1995 and Carmelo Anthony existed. Even if he would be screwed out of the rookie of the year award to LeBron James, he was the most intimidating rookie that year. But a team that lived by their one player was going to die by their one player.


Game 1 would feature a clinic being put on. Sam Cassell’s 40 points—16 of 24 from the field and 5 of 6 from deep. Garnett would try his best to out-duel his teammate with a mere 30 points, 20 rebounds while also managing to rack up 5 fouls and only play 36 minutes. 


Denver felt lost as their rookie simply couldn’t produce enough. 19 points, 6 of 17 from the field and fouling out wasn’t the entrance Anthony would have liked to make. He wasn't in Syracuse anymore, this wasn't March Madness where everyone would be experiencing nerves. Then again, he was going against what felt like the best team in the association.


Minnesota would continue the trend of scoring points and the Nuggets not being able to score a lot of points in game 2. Carmelo would struggle again—which meant this team would in-turn struggle. Despite Voshon Lenard having a heat-check start to the game—15 points, 6 of 9 shooting in the first, Denver would be held to 9 points in the second quarter.


And instead of Cassell lighting up the scoreboard, this would it would be Sprewell finding his stroke—going 11 of 17 from the field and 7 of 8 from deep. KG’s triple double, Wally Szczerbiak’s 11 points were enough to get the team to a confidence boosting 2-0 series lead and it truly felt like the team was ready to sweep.


But game 3 would produce some nerves. Bringing a play-off environment to Denver for the first time in  a while would have the crowd in full force and the altitude in Denver produced a sluggish start for the Wolves, that would be taken advantage of. Carmelo’s 10 in the first was impressive but the 1 of 4 and 1of 6 start from Sprewell and Cassell were signs of the offensive tempo the Wolves were so used to be disrupted. The Nuggets only missing 7 shots meant a slower game for the Wolves on the offensive end, meaning a lot more effort having to be exerted. 


Turnovers and mental lapses from the Timberwolves gave the Nuggets faithful something to cheer about it would be known this type of game couldn’t be replicated. You simply wouldn’t out rebound the Wolves every night.


Game 4 would be a banger. Both teams felt that it was must win—Denver had to win for morale support, Minnesota didn’t want to have to return to Denver or even having the chance of needing to win in Denver again.  


It was an ugly game until the final moments. Carmelo Anthony would not make a basket in the first half and would not record a point in the first half. Voshon’s hot first quarter would be met by a scoreless second. On the other half of the court, 3 fouls and 4 turnovers from Sam Cassell was not the first half start Saunders wanted from his point guard. Kevin Garnett would have a respectable 13 points and Latrell would have a solid 8 points but the Nuggets would battle to keep it a tied game at the half.


When the Nuggets would start the third quarter with a small line-up, it seemed like the right move— as they had an 11-2 run in the second. They were killing the Timberwolves with their points off turnovers statistics and every attempt to slow the game down would be met by either a poor shot or a questionable offensive foul call.


However, the Timberwolves would rebound. Uplifting possessions from the Nuggets — such as a Marcus Camby pump-fake and dunk onto Kevin Garnett—would be met by silencer jump-shot. Melo would score his first two points of the game but his teammates would step-up in his absence. Birdman—who had a solid first half—wouldn’t make an appearance in the third quarter and Kevin Garnett would find his game. His 6 free throw attempts, Trenton Hassell’s perfect 5 for 5 gave the Timberwolves a much needed lead going into the fourth.


Carmelo Anthony would only play 5 minutes inthe fourth quarter. After missing his 3 attempts, he would be pulled to create the small line-up that the Nuggets felt would be the answer to their problems. Voshon Lenard would continue to do his best to keep the Nuggets in the game but the small line-up of the Nuggets would be met by an even bigger line-up from the Timberwolves. 


With 1:27 to go, Lenard would drill a three-pointer off of a pump fake. to make it a one-point lead as Melo would be shown cheering on his team from the bench. The crowd was into but off of a timeout, Latrell Sprewell would be alone in the corner to quiet the crowd.

52.9 seconds to go, Lenard would match-up with Garnett on the perimeter but the ‘Big Ticket’ would punch the ball out of the sky, leading to an unfortunate empty possession of the Nuggets. 


Sam Cassell would bring the ball up and immediately post-up Earl Boykins on the left side of the floor.. As the shot-clock would wind down, his spin into a fadeaway jumper would not go in and instead, a sprinting Nene would slam home the quick two with 18.7 seconds left to go, making a 2-point game. 


Boykins would do his best to flop a foul but instead, he would put Latreel Sprewell at the line with 12.1 seconds to go. Sprewell hadn’t seen the line that night and the camera would turn to Carmelo Anthony, who would not enter the game. The 81% regular season free throw shooter would miss both attempts, as Sam Cassell couldn’t believe what he had witnessed, hands on his knees at the half-court line.


4.8 seconds to go, Andre Miller would get stuck near the circle but manage to get off an attempt that would somehow fall into the hands of Lenard, somehow avoiding Kevin Garnett’s clutches. Tough defense from the big men of Minnesota meant Nuggets fans were not going home with a happy ending. Garnett would launch the ball across the court in celebration and you would have thought they had just won game 7. 


Kevin Garnett was brutally honest in the post-game interview, saying “We’re playing like crap and we’re beating them” was the truth. They were playing like crap. But, they were still winning. Also, [shoutout to Kevin Garrnet’s mom](https://youtu.be/DrN529TeCxY?t=5634). 


Game 5 felt over before it even started. Carmelo Anthony did not dress for the game. Back home, the Timberwolves would dominate, breaking the streak of their first round exits. They would not have to return the Denver.


While they would prefer to play against Dallas, the Timberwolves would have to face a team that was looking to fight for their stay as one of the West’s best teams. It would instead feel like the end of one era and the start of a new one.


The match-up was intriguing as both teams had offensive flexibility, range and size. On the defensive end, the liability of Mike Bibby would mean Sam Cassell would be able to do all he wanted but it was known Bibby would attempt to fire back on the offensive end of the court. But the two wouldn’t be as impactful as the match-ups in the 2 and the 4—two swingmen and two power forward greats. 


This series is truly known for two games — game 3 and Game 7. The rest don’t matter as much, we kind of have to get through them.


The team that had lived off of the three point shot would struggle from deep in game 1 against the Timberwolves. However, an uncharacteristic performance from Kevin Garnett and Latrell Sprewell meant the Kings had stolen game 1. Bibby and Cassell would go for 33 and 40 points respectively in their offensive duel but we wouldn’t see the same battle for the rest of the series. 


A team that would score the second most points in the NBA would be held to 12 points in a quarter during game 2. The Timberwolves would find success with Garnett, Sprewell and Hassell scoring all 17 points for the team in the first quarter. A balanced team effort from Minnesota would be complemented by the King’s inability to make the ball fall into the basket and even with the Kings making a run-back into the game in the third, the Timberwolves would fight off Stojakovic and Webber’s attempts—with a 16 to 1 run to end the game, tying the series at 1-1.


Game 3 is where the fun begins. 


We start in the third. A tight first half would transition into a disaster situation as Bibby and Peja couldn’t get a basket in the third quarter. Hassell’s 10, Sprewell’s 8, KG’s 5 and relatively clean sheet from Cassell gave the Timberwolves a much needed 10 point lead going into the fourth. 


With 1:47 to go, some Kings fans would begin to exit their seats to avoid traffic. An 11-point lead from the Timberwolves seemed insurmountable, with the streaky shooting of the Kings and the defensive ability of the Wolves. Sam Cassell’s foul trouble had kept him out for most of the game but you knew he would be coming in to finish the deal.


*I mean, there’s no way they screw this up.*


Hassell would try left baseline but his kickout attempt to Sprewell would be intercepted by Peja, and Bibby would drill a transition three. 


100-92, Wolves. 


Immediately fouling Kevin Garnett, he goes 1 for 2.


101-92, Wolves. Timeout. 


The in-bounds play would be quick—get the ball into Bibby’s hands, try to make Cassell foul out. It worked. Doug Christie’s post-up and wrap around lead to contact in the paint and Cassell was out of the game. Ball didn’t lie as Christie would miss his first but hit the second.  


101-93. 


The Timberwolves would be able to drain the clock even further. But Sprewell’s attempt to get the ball to KG would get picked off by Peja. Fast break. Bibby would get the ball and with a defender in his face, would drain another three with 59 seconds to go.


101-96.

Sprewell would run it up the court and nearly turned it over, letting out a smirk as he got up—as if he was realizing what was about to happen.


Kevin Garnett would take his turn, attempting to seal the game but instead missed a jumper from the elbow. 37.3 seconds left and the Kings had the chance to make it a one possession game. Christie pulled the ball from the clouds and it was the perfect transition opportunity. Peja would be out ahead, Bibby and Webber would quickly follow creating a 4-on-2 fast break.


Not even thinking about a two, Christie kicked it to Peja and Sprewell would attempt to limit the damage by falling into Peja. 


And he still hit the three. The blank faces of the Timberwolves, Flip Saunders looking like he saw a ghost and Kings fans couldn’t believe it. Peja would miss the free-throw, the ball would fall out of bounds after a scuffle and the Timberwolves could let out a sigh of relief for a moment.

101-99, 30.2 seconds left, Timberwolves ball. 


Darrick Martin would look like a fish out of water attempting to bring the ball up would still manage to draw a foul. *Could he be the one to secure the win for the Timberwolves?* No. It wouldn’t be a good story. He would go 1 for 2, Kings secure the rebound.


102-99, 24.8 seconds left.


The Timberwolves would set-up to eliminate the three. They would execute that portion of the defense to perfection but instead, leave Chris Webber in a mismatch in the paint and he would be able to execute a beautiful hook shot over the smaller defender. 

102-101, 17.8 seconds left. 


Darrick Martin would be the man to go to the line once again. This time he would not miss. 


104-101, 17.2 second left. 


*No threes, no threes.* 


The Kings would immediately put the ball into play and Bibby would be a man on a mission. He would run to the right side of the court where Peja stood and they would execute the simple 'hand-off, screen, shoot.' The Timberwolves backcourt weren’t able to fight through the screens or trap and Peja had the look of a lifetime. Bottom of the net, swish.

104-104, 10.7 seconds left. 


The only play the Timberwolves could run would be through Garnett. If possible, he could kick it out but you knew Garnett would be the first person to touch the ball. He would from the low post to the top of the arch and be guarded by Brad Miller. Losing his footing and the help defense that would come from Peja and Webber meant KG couldn’t get a good look at the basket. 


We had overtime. 


When the Kings won the jump and Peja would score the first two points of overtime, it felt like the game was over. *Did the Timberwolves just collapse? Did they choke?*


And then there was the re-jump. 

Brad Miller and Kevin Garnett would fight for the rebound and we would have the jump for possession. Brad Miller would commit a violation and the Timberwolves had the ball again. It was a weird moment in the game — the crowd had quieted down. The reckless, craziness of the crowd instead returned to a normal play-off crowd. It was a different atmosphere. 


It would get worse.


A Mike Bibby foul with 2:34 put the Timberwolves at the line and he would be out with his sixth foul. But instead of walking with grace, he would throw his headband into the crowd and a stunned Rick Adelman could only act as a peacemaker for the man who may have just changed the game by committing a technical foul.


It wouldn’t matter - Hoiberg missed the free throw but the Timberwolves now had a two point lead. But still, stupid f***ing mistake, Bibby. 


Stojakovic would be the only Kings’ player to record a point in overtime. His three-point shot after countless offensive boards gave the Kings a 1 point with 1:45. The Wolves and Peja would trade buckets back-and-forth but the Wolves would have the ball with 31.5 while they were the ones holding a one point lead.


Acting point guard Kevin Garnett would set up the offense and you could tell a power forward was setting up the offense by how crazy it looked. Hand-offs around the perimeter somehow created a match-up of Christie on Garnett at the foul line. And with 1 second left on the shot-clock, Garnett somehow got up a shot that would bounce in with 10.8 left in the game.


It was MVP sh**. 


Flip Saunders and a Florida retirement community resident-looking Kevin McHale would immediately signal to foul rather than let the Kings get another look at a three-point shot. Peja would hit both.


6.1 seconds left, 114-113, Timberwolves. 


Garnett would get the ball on the inbounds but would trip. Trapped near his bench, the tower would fall and the refs would signal traveling. You couldn’t make it up. 


With 4.1 seconds left, the Kings would have two opportunities to draw up a play. The first, would fail to create anything and a timeout would be called to re-grouped. 


The second time, a high screen from Brad Miller would leave Peja free at the top of the arch. But the inbounds pass from Doug Christie would lead Peja out towards half court, meaning he now had to dribble as the Timberwolves now had time to react. His attempt to draw a foul would not work and the Timberwolves weren’t done yet.


Games 4, 5 and 6 weren’t as fun. 


Game 4 would be a great game from Chris Webber. Game 5 would be a great game from Latrell Sprewell. Game 6 would just be a great performance from the Kings—because you couldn’t end an era on your home court. 


Game 7 was set. 


The winner of the series would have to prepare to face a Shaq and Kobe team that looked to somewhat be back in form, taking the series 4-2 against the Spurs. Then again, if Derek Fisher doesn’t hit a miracle buzzer beater in game 5, the story might have been different.


The plot was simple — would Sam Cassell stop slumping? Is Kevin Garnett having a moment? Are the Kings still kings? 


We received another instant classic. 


Kevin Garnett and Sam Cassell would start the game hot — scoring 18 of the team’s 22 first quarter points. Sprewell’s 0 for 5 from the field balanced out the team struggles that the Kings were facing. The second quarter would again feature shooting woes—this time KG, Cassell and Peja would not hit a shot from the field. KG would also have a ridiculous catch-block—even if his solid defense wasn’t leading to good offense. Sprewell would put together 5 points but would also draw his third foul and the Timberwolves were desperate for a spark plug.


And then Wally Szczerbiak stepped on the court. His scrappy, role-player minutes combined with his impressive jaw-line had fans falling in love with him. Despite not being the prospect he originally once was, he was an asset to the team off the bench as both a scorer and defender. 


 His 12 points in the game 6 lost wouldn’t be a thought in the minds of most but rested in the minds of the Timberwolves coaching staff. Because in the second quarter of that game, he would go 4 for 6 from the field, put up 10 points and have a heat-check moment of a lifetime. There would just be random, Lin-sanity type moments where he would just dribble around the floor and somehow manage to get off a shot an drill it. It was beautiful. 


The Timberwolves had managed to keep the Kings under 20-points each quarter but their ability to runaway with a lead never happened. And when the third quarter came, the Kings would look to crush the souls of the Minnesota faithful. Doug Christie would be perfect in the third from the field but it would be a team effort from the Kings to close the gap, Sprewell and Cassell would look to put the team on their backs but turnovers would give free points away. 


Webber and Stojakovic would pick the worst times to go cold in the fourth. Kevin Garnett would pick the perfect time to show he was the best player in basketball that year. But the low scoring affair would keep things interesting. 


With 1:03 to go, 79-75 Minnesota, Mike Bibby would wrap around a screen and drive to the basket. Creating what felt like an easy look for Chris Webber — who had been struggling that night — wouldn’t pay any dividends as Webber would scream for a foul call on the contested finish at the basket. 


A possibly injured Sam Cassell would bring the ball up and stand near half-court to draw out the clock. But Doug Christie’s dive for the ball would get his team the ball back, add another foul to the Timberwolves’ tally and more importantly, create an empty possession for the Timberwolves. 


After trading free throws, the score would be 81-77 Timberwolves as Mike Bibby would receive the outlet pass on a missed free throw. He would kick it out to Christie, who would make sure his feet were behind the line, and drill the three point shot with 17 seconds to go. 


81-80, Timberwolves. 


The Kings would quickly foul Sam Cassell and put him to the line. Despite the possible injury, he would hit both free throws, put this team up 3 with 16.2 seconds to go.


You would expect Peja to be your go-to but his rough shooting night—3 of 12— meant he probably wasn’t the best option. Being able to focus on perimeter defense was a huge advantage for the Timberwolves—even with the deep threats. 


[Christie would inbounds the ball to Bibby](https://youtu.be/kLbTODPNXbA?t=1046)—who would now be alone in the corner. A failed high screen from Chris Webber meant Bibby now had to face the wraith of Kevin Garnett and more time would be wasted attempting to get Garnett off of Bibby by the Kings. Swinging it out to Christie gave the Kings a good look but the shot would not fall but Kevin Garnett not being in the low-post meant the Kings had the opportunity to get the offensive rebound. 


Miller would secure the rebound but KG wouldn’t kept away from the low post any longer and would swat away the two-point attempt. 


2.5 seconds to go. 


The Kings had a decent spot out of bounds. Brad Miller and Peja at the top of the arch was a decoy — the play was always going to Chris Webber. Garnett would attempt to pick off the floating pass but his long arms couldn’t reach. Instead, it left Webber wide open. 


The ball would loop out and Weber would collapse to the floor. Sprewell, Wally and KG would embrace, the Kings players couldn’t believe it and Kevin Garnett would leave the floor on his birthday a happy man.


Now — Sam Cassell.


The most under-discussed, under appreciated storyline in all of basketball history is the Sam Cassell ‘Big Balls Dance.’ A dance that would feature a bow-legged Sam Cassell galloping down the court, attempting to show fans his huge nut sack would create a lot controversy. You won’t find it in NBA highlight reels — even though Kobe Bryant would re-create it years later. The NBA completely hates it. 


But its so memorable because of its presumed effect on the 2004 play-offs. 


In the Game 7 match-up, after drilling a jumper, Cassell would run down the court, completing his dance. I tried it myself at home, it hurts a little bit. But according to Flip Saunders, it lead to an avulsion hip fracture that would limit Cassell’s appearance in the western conference finals. He would play 31 minutes in game 1, less than a minute in game 2, 27 minutes in game 3, 5 minutes in game 4 and that would be the last time we would see Sam Cassell in 2004. Sam Cassell had issues in the post-season with a re-occuring back issue. But this hip issue, this was interesting, it made sense with minor changes in his mannerisms.


The lack of Sam Cassell at full strength would cost the Timberwolves the series and their shot at the title. This wasn’t a situation like last year when Klay Thompson just added to the reasons why the Golden State Warriors lost and wasn’t the key component to the loss— the Timberwolves likely would have made it past the Lakers and had prior history of playing well against this Pistons line-up.


Phil, Kobe and Shaq smelled blood. 


The lack of Cassell removed a critical offensive threat and offensive leadership. It allowed for Kevin Garnett to play a flexible game and go unpunished. Now, the aging Karl Malone would have help when guarding KG. Defensively, the Timberwolves could hang in the series. Shaq would still be an unstoppable force but could be maintained by the various big men of the T-Wolves and a helping KG. It would lead to Karl Malone have a better series but if you were beat by the Karl Malone as the third man of any team, you would be understanding. 


Damn it, Cassell.


If he plays healthy, here is what (probably) happens:

(a) Rick Fox and Luke Walton see the floor more as Karl Malone is no long on the receiving end of defensive leniency from the Timberwolves. Malone would suck for most of the series but would still get a lot of free buckets.

(b) Gary Payton takes more minutes from Derek Fisher. 

(c) Kevin Garnett likely doesn’t get guarded as tight.

(d) Sprewell gets a lot more off-ball opportunities and just plays better.

(e) The pace of the game goes up from mid-to-high 80s to low 90s. 

(f) The series becomes a more physical, high action match-up.

(g) We get one interesting soundbite out of Shaq.

(h) We get at least 7 games or a Timberwolves victory.

(i) We still probably get a Sam Cassell 'Big Balls Dance.' 


If Phil Jackson says they probably lose the series of Cassell is healthy, I believe him. But, let’s also look at the games.


At the start of game 1, you would have thought Cassell's impact would be fine. His 3 of 5 shooting, 4 assists was a great start to the game. The Timberwolves would test old man Karl Malone with his confidence, allowing him to go 2 for 6 from the field but would struggle to find the right way to guard Shaq. Michael Olowokandi would be out muscled on the defensive end but would still get a respectable 8 points back, going 4 for 5 from the field. 


As the game progressed, the gambles would fall into the favor of the Lakers. Cassell would see less playing time, meaning Hoiberg and Wally would have to lead the offense — which they couldn’t do. Karl Malone would go from starting 0 for 4 to hitting his next four shots and suddenly, you couldn’t help as much on Shaq. 


Cassell would do his best to fight through the pain but his 1 for 5 performance in the third quarter would provide more harm than help.  Malone, Bryant, O’Neal and Fisher would dominate the third quarter on the offensive end and the half-time adjustments were completely one sided. Despite a poor first game from Kobe, you wouldn’t have realized it. 


Game 2 already became a must-win and must-win, they did. The bench guards of Wally and Darrick Martin would combine for 31 points—we don’t talk about how they went a combined 10 of 27 from the field. Garnett would not be stopped, putting up 24 points on 10 of 20 from the field. The bench of the Lakers wouldn’t provide the assistance you would need with slumping starters and their 71 points would be their second lowest points the team produced in the play-offs. 


That would not happen again in the series. 


Cassell would attempt to return in game 3 but again, he was a liability. He would be outmatched by Gary Payton and Payton would pop off. Wally Szczerbiak would do his best as a replacement, but his inability to lead an offense still clouded his 21 points. Garnett and Sprewell’s slow first half was taken advantage of by the Lakers — who produced a lead that could not be overcome from, despite the duo returning to form in the second.


Game 4 would continue to trend of an offensive disaster from the Timberwolves as Garnett and Sprewell would struggle to buy a bucket in the first half—going 9 for 26 from the field. The low scoring affair felt like a good sign — as Karl Malone and Kobe Bryant would struggle to find rhythm but Derek Fisher splitting time with Gary Payton meant he could find his own rhythm—5 for 7, 10 points. 


Bryant would finally make his appearance in the series with an 18 point third quarter, making up for Karl Malone’s 1 of 6 shooting in the same time. KG was unable to match the offensive firepower and the Lakers 15 point lead after three would carry the Lakers to a game 4 victory.


You cannot end an era on your home court so in game 5, we would get one last fight. It would not start in the first quarter but a tone would be sent. Garnett would take 7 shots — hit 2, Sprewell would put up 5 attempts and hit 2. The duo would not lose this game and they would be the ones to determine the fate of the team in the play-offs.


Second quarter — 4 for 7 from Garnett, 5 for 8 from Sprewell. 

Third quarter— 4 for 6 from Garnett plus four free throw appearances and makes, which was a nice change for Garnett after not seeing the line as much as you would like. Sprewell also had a made basket but the bench mob Hoiberg and Wally would be the impactful guards of the quarter.


The fourth quarter, things would get spicy down the stretch as the Lakers would go from 85 points to 96 points within 30.9 seconds but the lead created by the Timberwolves lead would not be touched—thanks to Sprewell, Garnett and Wally’s efforts at the line in the fourth. 


The Timberwolves would not be sent home on their home court but game 6 would be daunting. Draped in the signature blue uniforms, you would have thought the Timberwolves were attending their funeral after the first quarter. Kobe would explode for 10 points in the first quarter, Shaq would have 8 and more importantly, Garnett would draw two early fouls and only manage to produce 1 point off of a technical foul free throw. Trenton Hassell — who still existed— would try to re-emerge in the first but his 2 for 6 performance did not help. 


Quarter number two, Kobe and KG would trade narratives as Kobe would draw 2 quick fouls, only playing 3 minutes, and would produce 0 points. Garnett would put the team on his back, avoiding picking up another foul and get a solid 9 points up on the board for the team. But the real story was Shaq somehow managing to rack up 4 fouls in a quarter, an incredibly feat, as a sign of frustration with the Timberwolves’ ‘hack-a-Shaq’ strategy.  He would see the foul line 9 minutes and only manage  to put 2 of them in and Oliver Miller’s 4 second quarter fouls had paid off. 


With Kobe back in the game, the Timberwolves couldn’t get away with their treatment of the Lakers’ big man and he would return to his regularly schedule program of dominating fools with 10 3rd quarter points. But Kobe, Malone and Payton having 2 makes on 14 attempts meant the Lakers would still fall behind the Timberwolves. The starters of the Wolves managed to produce 22 points but the 3 point lead did not feel like enough, especially with Sprewell slowly struggling with this 3 of 8 performance. 


The fourth quarter would become desperation from the Timberwolves. The game would become incredibly physical and messy. As a result, 11 fouls and 7 turnovers  would be committed by Minnesota. The Wolves were killing the Lakers on second chance points though, then again the Lakers didn’t need second chances. 


The depressing result was that the talent on the Timberwolves wasn’t enough to win the series, despite it being an incredibly winnable series The dumb things that the Lakers would do — Derek Fisher trying to throw an alley-ooo to Karl Malone, Karl Malone just being trash, Kobe not having an incredible series — didn’t matter because the Timberwolves didn’t have their point guard. 


The game would wind down, as the Lakers had produced more than enough to secure their return to the finals. Kareem Rush’s career high 6-for-7 from deep—including 3 makes in the fourth quarter lone— were daggers every time they fell. 


Kevin Garnett would do his best to hide his emotions, Flip Saunders would stand on the sideline appearing like a concerned guidance counselor at your local high school. Attempting to hide his emotions, he would ignore the side huge from Saunders, avoid the high-fives and simply sit down in his chair and contemplate life. 


*You don’t end an era on your home court.* 


The off-season would be a painful one. Sprewell would notoriously retire after turning down a contract extension, meaning the Timberwolves would lose one of their big three and arguably take a setback in performance. Instead of putting the blame onto the lack of improvement from a managerial perspective, McHale would put the blame onto Saunders and fire him mid-season, replacing Saunders with himself. Sam Cassell would be traded, McHale would fire himself as a coach and it would set course for Kevin Garnett wanting out.


There would be a happy ending for two of the individuals involved -- Cassell and Kevin would find success with other franchises. But 2004 result would quietly drive a narrative that wasn't real. The Lakers weren't the best team in the west that year -- so their loss to the the Pistons in the finals wasn't as surprising. If the Lakers exit in the WCF, Kobe is likely picked as the weaker link -- as he arguably didn't perform as well as Shaq, despite the freedom he had against the Timberwolves backcourt. 


If the Timberwolves make it to the finals, they probably win. The regular season history favored the Timberwolves and they would be coming off beating the team that had terrorized them in previous first rounds, as well as having much needed rest. We probably see the Pistons try to run it back the following season, Cassell's lack of health issues probably means the Timberwolves would give Sprewell the contract he wanted, in attempt to run it back. McHale looks like a genius, Garnett might not go to the Celtics.

This is not the case. 

A lot more credit should be given to RC Buford and Poppovich for the Spur's success and consequently Duncan's success. 

Had Duncan been drafted to any other team, his success would be SIGNIFICANTLY impacted - It was actually a luck of a draw pick for the spurs as they had their injury season when they previously went to the WCF and the WCSF the year before that. Had duncan been drafted to boston, 76ers, or vancouver, i see him only winning 1 or 2 with boston or vancouver. 

The credit that Duncan gets without RC Buford or Pop being mentioned is actually disgusting as the Spurs front office is undoubtedly the best front office for the past two decades, and in my opinion, pop deserves the most credit. 

The only all time great skill that Duncan had was his defense. His offense was incredibly one dimensional as he couldn't run the floor, and was subpar in putting the ball on the floor when he was in the post. I don't even think its close when i say KG, Dirk, and Karl Malone were all better offensively than dirk. 

Fans like to say Shaq carried Kobe for their first three championships. I agree. Shaq was definitely the better player, but Kobe wasn't too far behind. 

Where I do give credit to Kobe is winning almost a 3 peat with Pau Gasol. This isn't to knock on Pau, he's one of the better passing big man of his time, but to be an almost 3 peat team, It says a lot more about Kobe Bryant to be honest. 

If Tim Duncan got drafted to any other team, I don't see him winning more than 2 rings. 

If Kobe got drafted to any other team, getting a pau gasol type player shouldn't be too hard. (Lebron got Dwayne wade, Chris Bosh, Kevin  Love, Kyrie Irving all within the span of 5 years), and would most definitely have AT LEAST 2 rings.

New Orleans Pelicans - Actual Pick: Zion Williamson 
Redraft Pick: Zion Williamson 

Ja Morant May have had the better rookie season and will probably win the ROTY Award, but Zion has looked like the best player in this draft. I know it’s early, but assuming Zion can stay healthy, I see him in Springfield in 25 years. As a rookie he’s averaged 23.6 ppg while shooting 58.9%. Those are outstanding numbers for anyone in the league let alone a rookie. With the progression of Lonzo Ball, and Brandon Ingram, the Big 3 that’s been set up in New Orleans is bound to win at least one championship if this core stays together throughout their careers.


2. Memphis Grizzlies - Actual Pick: Ja Morant
Redraft Pick: Ja Morant

Ja looks like a combo of John Wall and Russell Westbrook when I watch him. Who wouldn’t want that. Not only did he put up great rookie stats averaging 17.6 ppg and 6.9 apg, but he led a Grizzlies team that most expected to be amongst the worst in the league to the eighth seed in the West if the season ended today. He’s already had multiple game-winning shots and looks to also have the Damian Lillard clutch characteristic. Once again, I know it’s early, but seeing Ja in Springfield 25 years from now would not surprise me one bit.


3. New York Knicks - Actual Pick: RJ Barrett
Redraft Pick: RJ Barrett

It seems like everyone got the top-3 picks right, but I think there’s a lot more debate selecting RJ Barrett with the third pick than there is selecting Ja Morant second or Zion Williamson first. Barrett had an up and down rookie season while averaging 14.2 ppg, and 5.0 rpg on a below average 40.2% FG%. What he lacks in skill now, court vision, shot selection, and killer instinct, he makes up for in potential. There are two ways I could see Barrett’s journey going in the next few years. The first is his path to superstardom. With the exception of the fact that he plays for one of the worst run franchises in sports, Barrett has all the tools necessary to excel in this league. If the Knicks can surround him with the correct talent, I can see Barrett blossoming into an All-NBA type talent. The other direction is quite the opposite. Barrett never seems to adapt and plays a good 10-15 years in the league averaging about 10 ppg. A solid career for sure, but not warranted by the third overall pick.


4. Atlanta Hawks - Actual Pick: De’Andre Hunter
Redraft Pick: Eric Paschall

De’Andre Hunter has been fine for the Hawks. I wouldn’t label him a bust, and he’s played well, but I think the Hawks can do better with this pick in retrospect. Jumping all the way up from the 41st pick where Golden State selected him, Eric Paschall gets drafted by the Hawks fourth overall. While he attended Villanova, I saw lots of potential in Paschall and was unsure why he wasn’t being talked about as a lottery pick. When he fell to the second round I was even more confused. Paschall should’ve never fallen that far. In a large role for a crippled Warriors squad this season, Paschall put up 14.0 ppg, and 4.6 rpg. Those stats won’t blow you out of the water, but I’ll argue that this season, as a rookie, Eric Paschall was better than 2019-20 Draymond Green. Draymond is a great player, but only when he’s got the two best shooters of all-time on his side. Sorry, not sorry. The Hawks get their big to pair with John Collins in the frontcourt and now have a starting lineup including Trae Young, Kevin Huerter, Eric Paschall, and John Collins.


5. Cleveland Cavaliers - Actual Pick: Darius Garland
Redraft Pick: Rui Hachimura

The Garland-Sexton backcourt just isn’t gonna cut it for me. Garland has proved to be a horrible defender, and a solid offensive player. The Cavs were left this season without reliable scoring options outside of Collin Sexton and Kevin Love. I think Rui Hachimura could be that piece Cleveland needed. I don’t know who would’ve run point for Cleveland with no Garland, but they always could’ve added someone through free agency and/or trade. Hachimura has proved to be one of the most consistent scorers and rebounders in the class of 19’ and has looked well worth the ninth overall pick the Wizards used on him.


6. Minnesota Timberwolves - Actual Pick: Jarret Culver
Redraft Pick: Darius Garland

Out of the players who ended up getting drafted with the first seven picks in this year’s draft, Zion Williamson, Ja Morant, RJ Barrett, De’Andre Hunter, Darius Garland, Jarrett Culver, and Coby White, Culver was the one I saw the least potential in. To me, his best case scenario is, and has always been a smaller Robert Covington. In year one, Culver put up poor offensive numbers and was solid defensively, but was nowhere near worthy of this Pick. Minnesota needs a guard with the ability to distribute the ball to then small forward Andrew Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns. Garland averaged only 3.9 apg his rookie season, but the ability to average that many assists with your only other real scoring options being Collin Sexton and a Kevin Love that’s past his prime isn’t awful. Expecting much more would be cruel especially considering point guards usually take a while to adjust to the NBA.


7. Chicago Bulls - Actual Pick: Coby White
Redraft Pick: Coby White

Coby was not the most efficient or pure point guard out of the 2019 draft, but he sure has lots of potential. I would argue after the first three, Coby has more potential than anyone else in the draft class. Averaging 13.2 ppg on pretty bad shooting splits, White had a very up and down season. There were some weeks he averaged 20 ppg and other where he averaged 7 ppg. Now that the season is most likely over, I can confidently say that Coby is going to be one of the best scorers to come out of this draft. Once he puts everything together, Coby should be a future NBA All-Star.


8. New Orleans Pelicans - Actual Pick: Jaxson Hayes
Redraft Pick: Brandon Clarke

Brandon Clarke has looked like one of the biggest steals in this year’s draft. After averaging 12 ppg, 5.8 rpg, and 0.8 bpg, in limited minutes for Memphis, Clarke has started to draw comparisons to a young Shawn Marion. The Pelicans could use a player just like that. The Jaxson Hayes pick was good, but getting Brandon Clarke would be even better. A young core featuring Williamson, Ingram, Ball, and Clarke is looking pretty dang good.


9. Washington Wizards - Actual Pick: Rui Hachimura
Redraft Pick: PJ Washington

The Wizards become the first team to actually get a worse player in this redraft. The Rui Hachimura selection was great, but at least they’re still able to select PJ Washington with the ninth pick. Washington and Hachimura are very similar players so not much changes here for Washington.


10. Atlanta Hawks - Actual Pick: Cam Reddish
Redraft Pick: De’Andre Hunter

The Hawks luck out and are able to grab Hunter six pick after they originally selected him. Like I said before, Hunter didn’t have a bad rookie season by any means. To me, he just didn’t justify the fourth overall pick. The Hawks get one of the best 3&amp;D players in the draft and are now able to run a starting lineup of Trae Young, Kevin Huerter, De’Andre Hunter, Eric Paschall, and John Collins, with Jabari Parker and Alex Len off the bench. The teams not great, but the future looks bright.


11. Phoenix Suns - Actual Pick: Cam Johnson
Redraft Pick: Sekou Doumbouya

I don’t know what was going on in Phoenix on draft night, but it was far from good. Cam Johnson was projected to be a late first round pick and that’s what he’s proved to be this far in his career. This pick was awful. Luckily, the Suns select international prospect Sekou Doumbouya in this universe. Sekou showed flashes of greatness in his first year as a Piston, but you wouldn’t know it just by looking at the stats. His opportunities were limited this season, but he definitely has potential to live up to his draft day comparison Pascal Siakam. Their rookie stats are very similar, and now Sekou has a chance to lead the Pistons into the next era of Detroit basketball. Pairing him with Devin Booker and De’Andre Ayton looks very good for the future and much, much better than Cam Johnson.


12. Charlotte Hornets - Actual Pick: PJ Washington
Redraft Pick: Tyler Herro

Honestly, I can rationalize drafting Herro anywhere after the third pick, but this is just where I have him falling. A lot of teams ahead of this pick already have their shooting guard for the next few years. The Bulls have LaVine, the Cavs have Sexton, the Wizards have Beal, the Pelicans have Holiday, and the Suns have Booker. Here I have Herro falling (technically climbing) to the Hornets at 12. The Hornets initial selection of PJ Washington was a good one, but now he’s off the board. Selecting a scorer like Tyler Herro who’s shown flashes of Klay Thompson would be a great selection here. Having a sharpshooting backcourt of Devontae Graham and Tyler Herro looks very fun for the future, and if Miles Bridges can progress into a 15-20 ppg scorer the Hornets should be looking pretty good in a few seasons. 


13. Miami Heat - Actual Pick: Tyler Herro
Redraft Pick: Jarrett Culver

Culver comes into a perfect situation in Miami. With Jimmy Butler coming to town in free agency, Culver has the opportunity to learn from a player who most likely is his absolute best case scenario. Butler was once a strictly defensive-minded player too, and maybe he’d be able to help Culver progress into a much better offensive player the way he did in Chicago with the Bulls and Luol Deng. Herro was a solid piece in the Heat’s success this year, but not having Herro doesn’t ruin the Heat. Maybe they’re a game or two worse with Culver, but not drastically worse. The Heat still win selecting Culver at 13.


14. Boston Celtics - Actual Pick: Romeo Langford
Redraft Pick - Matisse Thybulle

I strongly considered sending Thybulle to the Heat at 13, but instead liked the prospect of Jarrett Culver getting tutored by Butler more than Thybulle. The 13th and 14th Pick are pretty interchangeable in my eyes in this instance. The Celtics made a mistake drafting Romeo Langford, but at the time, the pick wasn’t awful. Langford was coming off an injury riddled season at Indiana, and the Celtics took a risk on his upside. Langford only played 11 mpg in 27 games in his first NBA season and didn’t look great doing so. Thybulle however has looked like an incredible defensive player. His offensive stats wouldn’t impress you, but he averaged 1.4 spg, and 0.7 bpg. For a rookie only getting 19.5 mpg, those stats look great.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,81540,public,self,"Redrafting the 2019 NBA Draft, One Year Later",0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/fyt4c1/redrafting_the_2019_nba_draft_one_year_later/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

The rules are simple, you can only choose one option for each of these three player designations - **guards, wings, bigs** \- for your team as a way to address team needs this off season. Try to keep it realistic to your team's current situation (i.e. if your team is tight on cap space, you can't expect to sign a max player ... consider also your team's current draft position). Finally, base your choices off this year's current draft/free agent player availability.

&amp;#x200B;

**Draft** \- your priority would be to draft a player to add value to the position

**Sign** \- your priority would be to sign a free agent to add value to the position

**Keep** \- you like this position as it currently stands

&amp;#x200B;

An example, as a Bulls fan, I'd probably choose:

**Guards:** *sign a free agent.* White, LaVine and Satoransky could be a solid core, but with Dunn possibly leaving and a wealth of guard options, searching for a solid veteran to support the guards seems like the best option. Even if Dunn stays, adding a veteran guard allows the team to play some three guard lineups to limit their weakness on the wings.

**Wings:** *draft a player.* Bulls are desperate for wings at this point. For the money available though, it's not likely they'll get a worthwhile wing, but there are some decent options around the #7 pick in this year's draft that could compliment the team and possibly grow into something more. In this scenario, the Bulls are also praying for health for Porter Jr and Hutchison.

**Bigs:** *keep as is*. Carter, Maarkanen, Gafford, Kornet are four young players with different skillsets. It's probably worth keeping them as is to see what's truly there.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,81511,public,self,"The 'Draft, Sign, Keep' game (an NBA version of 'marry, f**k, kill')",0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/fyobht/the_draft_sign_keep_game_an_nba_version_of_marry/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

• Rudy Gobert, 2x Defensive Player of the Year, went 27TH!

• MICHAEL CARTER-WILLIAMS (11th overall) won ROTY and was seen as the “next big thing”

• Just THREE 2nd round selections still have a job in the NBA

• SIX of the top-10 picks (this doesn’t include Bennett) never made an impact and have made a career as a bench booster

• Aside from Victor Oladipo and Giannis, only CJ McCollum (who went 10TH!!??) came out of this class and has posted at least one 20+ PPG season

• The Cavaliers won 1st overall pick, selected Bennett, and traded him to Minnesota. The next year? The Cavaliers won 1st overall pick, select Andrew Wiggins, and traded him to Minnesota.

First of all, thank you for clicking this post. I’ve been working on this project for quite a few weeks, and I am very excited to see what the people think of it. This is a choose-your-own-adventure interactive game, where you will make the decisions of the players. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Coronavirus outbreak has rocked the sports world, and many, especially us basketball fans, find ourselves deeply missing one of our favorite pastimes. We loved seeing the world’s best athletes compete at the highest level. Games were lost, championships were won, and Hall Of Fame careers were made. Every fan has their favorite Hall Of Fame player, a player who changed the game and has been similarly immortalized in Springfield. Now, you have the chance to be that Hall Of Fame player, you have the chance of hitting the big shots, making the league, going division 1 and playing with some of the best coaches on the planet. 

&amp;#x200B;

For this immersive story, I contacted several D-1 coaches (Special thanks to Floyd Spielberg from UZA) and even had the chance to discuss with former NBA and Euroleague athletes, who all offered their stories, their path to the big leagues. This has been a long process, but I believe it will enrich not only your day but your appreciation and fandom of this amazing game. 

&amp;#x200B;

The story will include many trials, tribulations, and tests that real professional prospects dealt with and the way you react will greatly impact how you fare for there are dozens of unique outcomes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope to hear your reactions in the comment section and, once again, thank you for participating.

I think it's too early yet to really try to rank Giannis all-time (he's just 25), and I think we've argued enough about where LeBron slots in - top 3 seems pretty consensus right now. But how about everyone else(taking into account only their careers so far)?

Steph - I have him at the back end of the top 20 right now, of course with the possibility to go higher. Of course the top 11 is almost impossible to crack, and I think guys like Malone, Robertson, and West are still ahead of him career-wise. I have him around maybe 18 or 19, with or just behind guys like Dirk or Nash. If the Warriors continue having success in the next few years, he obviously moves up, and if they win a ring with him as the best player then I think he will definitely be top 15.

KD - Unlike a lot of people, I don't think that KD is clearly ahead of Steph. Maybe at 16-17 a couple spots ahead of Steph, but I think it's arguable that Steph might even be ahead of KD. In the KD Warriors years, a lot of people liked to argue that Steph was more valuable to the Warriors but KD was better overall. If you take a look at the advanced stats (which obviously don't tell the whole story), Steph provided more value to the Warriors than KD - Steph elevated the team more. I think KD's legacy is really going to come down to how he comes back from his Achilles. If he returns to superstar status and wins a ring, or at least leads a contending team to the Finals/Conference Finals a few times, I think he'll have a pretty solid case for being next man up after the top 11(12-15 range). On the other hand, if his Achilles injury really hampers him and he never comes back to full strength (hopefully that doesn't happen), then how much credit can we give him for his rings and FMVPs, when it's very arguable that he was not the most valuable player to his team?

Kawhi - Kawhi's just really hard to rank. I mean his postseason record is amazing, but the Spurs team was weird in that FMVP could have gone to a lot of guys and it's not like Kawhi put the team on his back, and while full credit to him for beating the Warriors (you can only play who's in front of you), it would have gone differently if KD and Klay were healthy, and who knows what would have happened if Klay didn't get hurt. Another thing hurting him is his load management in the regular season - the best ability is availability, and his regular season accolades are kinda lacking. But I think postseason success matters a lot to your legacy, and Kawhi has shined where it matters most. I have him around 25-28, but remember that he's 3 years younger than Steph/KD which is why I have him way lower. With reasonable playoff and regular season success, but no more championships, he probably moves close to the top 20. On the other hand, if he wins a ring with the Clippers and has 3 rings with 3 FMVPs on 3 different teams, I think he'll have a genuine argument to be top 15 as well.

Harden - Harden has the least playoff success of anyone on this list here, and I do hold it against him because while he has had good performances, he also has thrown in a lot of duds in the playoffs. The 13 TOV game, the 10 point game against the Spurs, his inability to get past the Warriors, his poor performance in his only finals appearance to date (though to be fair he was very young), being subbed out against the Clippers will be fairly or unfairly held against him. Out of everyone here, Harden's legacy is the most dependent on him getting a ring. Right now I have him with Kawhi at 25-30 range, but I don't see him cracking the top 20 without a ring. Of course his regular season numbers are insane, and he should have at least 2 MVPs(either he wins it over Westbrook for better team success, or he wins it over Giannis for better stats, can't have it both ways) However, basketball is a sport where one star player can have an insane effect on his team - this isn't baseball where the best player can miss the playoffs. In a sport which is so dependent on a star player, I don't see how Harden can break into the top 20 without a ring, despite his amazing individual success.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,81474,public,self,Where do you rank the 4 best players of this era all-time?,0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/fyhphh/where_do_you_rank_the_4_best_players_of_this_era/,some_ads,7,,,099e778a-8b9a-11e8-b53d-0eebf66bed8a,Player Discussion,,,,,,,,,,,

Another thing is that I've seen people say that guys like Joe Johnson and Kyle Lowry should eventually make the hall of fame. I don't really see that as Joe Johnson was never on the tier of  Lebron, Melo, KD, Pierce. Kyle Lowry was never on the level of Curry, Westbrook, Paul or Harden. Guys that I think should define the standard for HOF.  
    
Now in my eyes, If I was starting a hall of fame from scratch I don't think they really should make it. They're 6-7 time all stars but those were mainly as reserves in a week Eastern conference, both players only made 1 All-NBA team.

Even if you stacked a team with incredible scorers I think you get diminishing returns after having more than having two ""centerpiece"" offensive players that take a bunch of shots, so my vision is the rest of the team operates more off-ball to provide spacing. My criteria for evaluating who I should put in a position goes beyond just how good their shooting is though, I want the best combination of shooting, playmaking, and defensive versatility I can get. So here are my picks:

Forward Positions:
I think the best choices here are Larry Bird, Paul George, Kevin Durant, and Lebron James. Larry Bird is a sure pick out of this group. He's a great defender, playmaker, and shooter, everything you want from an all time great playing in a more off ball role. James isn't the best shooter, but his playmaking ability is still very enticing. However, he's still an odd man out in the offense I want which requires a ton of spacing, and between Curry, Jordan, and Bird there should be more than enough playmaking to go around. This narrows it down to Durant and George. 

While George clearly checks more boxes than Durant, he's a better pure three point shooter and defender, Durant is just such an unstoppable scorer. I did mention before that I don't want more than two players operating as offensive ""centerpieces"" and Durant is a player that works best as a ""centerpiece"", but we saw in Golden State how good he became when he wasn't the focus of the defense. I think there's a case to be made for both. George would function better with the vision I had above with Curry and Jordan taking most of the offensive load, but Durant would be lethal if Curry and Jordan deferred some of the offensive responsibilities onto him. I'm gonna take a bold (for me) jump here and say that Durant is so good all around offensively that he's an exception to the diminishing gains theory and a centerpiece trio of Curry, Jordan, and Durant would absolutely be worth it. 

Forwards: Larry Bird and Kevin Durant

Center:
For me there's four apparent choices: Hakeem, Dirk, Lebron, and Draymond. Hakeem for his combination of defensive versatility and scoring, Dirk for his shooting, and Magic and Draymond for their defense and playmaking. Draymond is a great defender, but he flat out loses to the rest here in terms of what he can accomplish offensively. Hakeem is the most natural pick if I had to go with a traditional center, but this is era the era of position less basketball. Let's get spicy. In terms of height-to-shooting ability I think Dirk is the best choice, and sliding him at the five would take spacing to the max. On the flip side Lebron would provide unprecedented playmaking at the five.

I know what you're thinking. Didn't you just pass on Lebron because playmaking wasn't enough to overcome shooting deficiencies? Yes, at the forward positions, but at the five things get interesting. Lebron's shooting would actually be pretty decent for a five, and his he would also easily blow by bigs that come out to contest him. A mention must also be made of Magic. His playmaking would easily be the best in the team, but I'm not sure he would have the gravity to make best use of his passing at the five spot. Yes, Lebron isn't some force under the rim either, but in this case (ironically) his shooting gives him an edge over Magic. But ultimately I still want some kind of strong presence in the paint both offensively and defensively, so I'm sticking with Hakeem.

Center: Hakeem Olajuwon

My final team is kind of a strange amalgamation of different philosophies that's bound by modern positionless spacing and defensive principles. It could have better pure shooting and better defense across the board, but instead it seems like it can't make up its mind on how traditional it wants to be. But I think that's fine with players of this caliber, they're so great they can adapt to whatever they need to offense or defense to be on the fly. Let me know how you guys would construct a team in this scenario.

So I'm naturally going a little bit stir crazy. I've had this idea since I was in high school (2012) and I think it's pretty close to what some people have suggested but I think this optimizes a lot the league office's concerns, owner's concerns, player concerns and fan concerns. Anyways, here it is:

&amp;#x200B;

* ***The New NBA Model:***

&amp;#x200B;

It starts with an expansion. You bring in 2 teams. Let's say one is the Sonics and one is Louisville. After expansion, reseeding is obviously necessary. We do away with East and West and move to a more NFL style division system. With this, we have 8 divisions and these are:

&amp;#x200B;

* Northwest

Seattle Supersonics

Portland Trailblazers

Denver Nuggets

Utah Jazz

&amp;#x200B;

* California

Golden State Warriors

Sacramento Kings

Los Angeles Lakers

LA Clippers

&amp;#x200B;

* Southwest

Phoenix Suns

San Antonio Spurs

Dallas Mavericks

Houston Rockets

&amp;#x200B;

* Central

Oklahoma City Thunder

Memphis Grizzlies

New Orleans Pelicans

Louisville Expansion

&amp;#x200B;

* Midwest 

Minnesota Timberwolves

Milwaukee Bucks

Chicago Bulls 

Indiana Pacers

&amp;#x200B;

* Great Lakes

Detroit Pistons

Toronto Raptors

Cleveland Cavaliers

Philadelphia 76ers

&amp;#x200B;

* Northeast

New York Knicks

Brooklyn Nets

Boston Celtics

Washington Wizards

&amp;#x200B;

* Southeast

Charlotte Hornets

Atlanta Hawks

Orlando Magic

Miami Heat

&amp;#x200B;

You could regroup into two divisions and make it East and West but with how I format the playoffs, it wouldn't have much of a difference. If this were to happen and either expansion teams happened else where, you easily slot different teams over to another division as this layout is more geographically connected than the current layout. Another reason this is going to be more helpful in the long run is to boost parity within the league. If a player is in a stacked division (lets take the Cali division) and is having trouble breaking through, they could sign in a division with maybe an easier route to the success. So, we've got divisions set, how is the regular season going to work? Does it address resting? Can we cut down on games? Are owners going to lose money? How do we keep fan interest?

&amp;#x200B;

* ***The Regular Season***

&amp;#x200B;

This new season format works as follows: Within team's divisions, a team plays the other three teams four times. Two home and two away games, then the rest of the league is play one home and one away. This adds up to 68 regular season games, a 14 game reduction from the current regular season layout. This not only reduces player fatigue and hopefully helping reduce the need for resting but makes games more valuable for teams to stay in the playoff hunt and minimize tanking. Making individual games more important should be the number one priority of the NBA. By spreading out divisions and reducing the number of regular season games, this could make a Monday night match up of the Wolves and Pistons a watchable game. Owners shouldn't feel any stress on money loss either. This isn't a huge reduction like some suggestions of 58 games if the current league did a one home one away format. And some money is still to be made with how I layout the playoff format.

&amp;#x200B;

* ***The Play-In and Play offs***

Here is where I think things get really interesting. For the playoffs, the top two teams in every division get a play off spot. This still leads to a 16 team tournament for the playoffs. But, we have a play-in tournament, wherein, the bottom two teams that made the playoffs are put into the play-in tournament against the next four teams with the best record. To seed the play-in tournament, the two teams with the best overall records (not just the teams that had already made the playoffs) get a bye on the first round. So you have two first round PI games against the the bottom four teams in this bracket. The winners of those games then play the next two teams with the best record. The two winning teams of the PI tournament are put into the playoffs at this point and the playoffs are then seeded by regular season record overall. So if the Warriors get the third seed in the Cali division but win out in the play in tournament, they would be reseeded into the playoffs as if they had made it in regardless. Okay, yes. It is a little convoluted when written out, but think of it basically as the wildcard slots in the NFL. This adds excitement, it adds do or die games and it makes the your regular season worth winning games. You'd rather win your games when you can then have to match up with a Warriors, or a Southwest division team, or a Grizzlies sneaking into the PI and upsetting a team that could've had a guaranteed spot. That's gotta make for exciting basketball, right?

Hey everyone - I used my biomechanics, sport science, and youth basketball coaching background to break down Kobe’s devastating first step and blow-by ability. Thanks to the mods for letting me post.

Here’s a table of contents, header (sub-headings):

\- 0:00 Intro

\- 0:29 The setup (calm composed calculated, creating an opening, cross sport examples, mental speed, elite athlete = physical &amp; mental)

\- 3:57 The drive (balance, movement synergies, weight shift &amp; elastic recoil, hit them hit them angles)

\- 6:03 The upshot

For those at work or the hard of hearing, I've transcribed subtitles on YouTube so sound isn't required.

Summary (tough without the visuals but will do my best): Kobe's devastating first step first began with his ability to calmly and astutely read to understand where the help side D was stationed and how his defender was playing him and reacting to his movements. Once Kobe had picked out the spot he wanted to get to, he would utilize a series of deception techniques (jab steps to either side, the ability to shoot off either hand, the threat of his jumper which reduced the cushion and margin of error for the defender, shoulder and head feints) to open up the avenue he wanted. Once that avenue became available, he was able to use his mental speed (perceive - process - react) to immediately take action. Kobe's triple threat stance and drives always began from a balanced base and he would coordinate a torso and hip drop along with dropping the ball to lower his center of mass/gravity while loading his lower body. He'd utilize the principle of elastic recoil on the achilles/calf complex of his trail leg and along the entire leg of his lead leg to create a powerful double acceleration step. Once he was by the defender, he utilized his shoulder to gain inside leverage and cutoff the recovery angle.

For reference, I’m a DPT and former youth basketball coach well-versed in sports science and biomechanics, with sports rehab &amp; performance clinics in West LA and Valencia, CA. Feel free to hit me with questions and/or you can always find me on IG and twitter @ 3cbperformance.

With all the mythology of how Hakeem totally dominated Robinson and the Spurs I was actually how shocked how close the series was in a couple of games.

In Game 1, with 30 seconds left and leading by a point, Doc Rivers stripped Hakeem and Sean Elliott is fouled with the chance to make it a 3 point game. However he steps up and bricks both free throws.

On the next possession with the shot clock winding down, Robert Horry hits a huge two pointer to take the lead for Houston. The Spurs come out of their time out and Elliott drives but his floater comes up short on the final possession.

If any of those go the other way, with the way the series panned out the Spurs could’ve taken a 3-1 lead into a home game 5. If they lose that and Robinson melts down in the final minutes of Game 6, they’d still have had a Game 7 in San Antonio to fall back on.

Say they manage to win that and get past the Magic and Shaq in the finals who Rodman traditionally defended well against, does history still play out the same?

Popovich was only the GM in those days so my question is would he have still fired Bob Hill after their awful start in 1996/97 when they ended up tanking for Duncan?

On the other hand, can veteran players actually perform at the same level next year or can players like Lebron perform at the same level due to fewer kilometres on his legs?

&amp;#x200B;

If all players can't get injured and were healthy during playoffs, regardless when they had their injuries, who would've won the most?   


I think LeBron could've won 5 straight, '12, '13, '14(Dwade was having knee issues; still up for grabs as spurs were goddamn great), '15, '16. He would've lost 07, 11, 17, 18 since his teams here were just plainly outplayed. GSW could've won 3 straight, '17, '18, '19; respect to Raps but KD and Klay and Cousins battling injuries is a huge factor.   


Other teams I think could've won more: Boston when KG got injured, Spurs when Kawhi got injured, Chicago when Rose went down(but the Heat were tough to beat).

I assume most of you, as I, love to play basketball, but at the moment can only play by yourself and shootaround unless you have siblings. I’ve been trying to figure out how to entertain myself and I came with this challenge.

Here it is: Basically, It’s virtual horse with a player or team for a game that’s already been aired. Basically what your gonna do is every shot your player or team takes, you take. If you make a shot the team/player makes, you get +0 points. If you make a shot your team/played misses, you get +1 points. If you miss a shot your team makes, you get -1 points.

Step 1: Pick a game. It can be off NBA League Pass, YouTube, ESPN+, etc... It doesn’t matter, but pick a game.

Step 2: Decide whether you want to play against a team or a player. For example, I am playing as Michael Jordan during the 1991 Eastern Conference First Round Game 2 against the Knicks. Every shot Michael takes I replicate and I keep my score based off of the scoring listed above. 

Step 3: Start watching the game. Once your player or team shoots, you shoot. This can be a fun way to watch old games, and stay active during quarantine.

How to Win: If you finish with a total score of under 0 you lose. If you finish with a total score of 0, it’s a tie. If you finish with a total score of over 0, you win! I understand this will probably be very difficult to win, but I don’t call it a challenge for nothing. Also the players are being defended, you aren’t. Still It will be difficult. If wanted, you could always change win conditions, but this is just what I thought of now.

I don’t know if anyone’s thought of this before or if this is something that a lot of people do, but I came up with this idea off the top of my head right now and decided to share it with you.

PJ Brown and Charlie Ward were known for being great role players on their respective teams. PJ was known to do a lot of the dirty work for the Heat but had a good midrange game and was a very good defensive player, while Charlie Ward served mostly as the backup point guard for the Knicks, having only started in all games during the 1997-98 and the lockout shortened 1998-99 season. However, he did manage an 11 year career, so I was curious: which players have had long careers despite not having any personal awards or recognition?

To take this a step further, I've created some arbitrary criteria just for difficulty's sake that helps form this rather exclusive team:

* No All-Star appearances 
* No All-Rookie Team
* No defensive nor offensive awards
* No 6th Man of the Year Award 
* Career of 15 years or longer

By that criteria, PJ Brown nor Charlie Ward make the list (PJ due to being on an all-defensive team 3x and Charlie didn't have as long a career.) This also precludes very noteworthy ""role"" players such as Shane Battier, Tony Allen, Bruce Bowen, due to appearances on the all-defensive team or Lou Williams and Jamal Crawford, for having been 6th Man Of the Year. Udonis Haslem and Robert Horry barely miss the cut by being on the All-Rookie Team during their first years in the league.

Here are some players that I vaguely remember that fit the bill and the role(s) that they played the teams they were on. 

**PF: Kurt Thomas** - Excellent mid range game, perfect for pick and pops. Really reliable for solid shooting, rebounding. Known for being enforcer.

**C: Zaza Pachulia** - Game is relatively similar to Kurt Thomas, serves as enforcer, setting questionable picks. Decent shooting big man.

**G: Steve Kerr** - 3 point specialist/excellent shooter. Good sense of where he needs to be on floor at all times.

**G: Derek Fisher** - Decent 3 point shooter. Triangle offense in his Lakers days makes role of point guard less prominent, but makes the right play in clutch situations like Kerr.

**G: Avery Johnson** - Game very similar to Derek Fisher, high IQ player with a great AST/TO ratio.

Granted, these are players that fit a criteria that absolutely doesn't encompass the role player. Precluding defensive accolades is shaky at best because the great role players pride themselves in doing whatever the team asks them to do, which includes guarding the opposing team's best player/threat. 

In making the aforementioned list, however, I realized that these particular players have some common traits. For instance, all of the players listed play the majority of their careers for winning and championship-caliber teams. In addition, they do not wholly depend on their athleticism to play their respective type of game, which allows them to be relatively more durable than their peers. The big men, being enforcers, have an ageless offensive repertoire that allows them to prolong their careers while the guards play their roles extremely well (redundant but true) and just have a knack for the game that is necessary when it comes to playing with their superstar teammates. More often than not, this aids, specifically, the guards into the transition to their eventual head coaching careers (some a lot more successful than others).

With that aside and with disregard for the criteria set above, here are a few of my favorite role players (disclosure: I'm a Rockets fan, so very Rockets-centric) and why (memories or otherwise). 

**Mario Elie** - It wasn't defined then as it is now, but a classic 3 and D wing player. Came up clutch for Houston and San Antonio in their playoff and championship runs.

**Shane Battier** - Quintessential role player, in my opinion. Doesn't teem with athleticism, but one of the earlier adopters of analytics to best maximize his abilities. Linchpin on the Heat in their quest to win their championships.

**Chuck Hayes** - A 6'6"" power forward/center that was truly out-sized at his position but really held his own against them. Free throw form is forgettable (or is it?) but carved out a career just being a fundamentally sound post-defender and an underrated passer.

**PJ Tucker** - See Chuck Hayes. And shoots 3's. Especially those corner ones.

**Patrick Beverley** - Super pesky, controversially so, but can't question his effort. Type of player you love to have on your team but hate to play against.

**Tayshaun Prince** - The mid 2000's Detroit teams were among my all time favorite teams mostly because of their gritty, even keeled, and cohesive style of play. It'd be a crime to classify Tayshaun even as a role player, much less just a 3 and D player because he was more capable than that. In the Pistons' system, he played his role to a T (heh) with plus players at the rest of the positions.

**Leon Powe** - Probably don't see too many Leon Powe posts but watching the 2008 Celtics championship may not have happened without a Game 2 Finals explosion from him. Real hard worker, could easily get a double-double if given the minutes, however limited because of the roster and his health. He and the aforementioned PJ Brown set the tone for that team. Career was cut short, but Celtics fans will remember him fondly.

**Anthony Tolliver** - Known as a great locker room presence and a fan favorite. He has everything you can ask from a role player. Shoots 3's, grabs rebounds, plays multiple positions, doesn't need a lot of minutes. Lots of positive things heard from around the league when it comes to Tolliver's game and demeanor.

**Udonis Haslem** - Embodied Florida and Miami Heat basketball. Wasn't known as a shooter (more of a bruiser) coming out of the University of Florida, but lost a ton of weight, and offense evolved at the NBA level, resulting in a superb midrange game. Was always around the basket to grab a board. UD's a winner everywhere he went, and always manages to keep it real

**Nick Collison** - Whatever was said of Haslem can be said of Collison. He and Durant were the mainstays from the Supersonics to Thunder and was arguably the emotional leader of the team. Hustling for loose balls, taking charges, grabbing offensive rebounds were his M.O. Some may question why he had his jersey retired in OKC, but it's obvious to any Thunder or basketball fan, the significance of his contributions were to that franchise.

- the 2003 Finals setting records for (low) ratings

- rule changes in 2005 encouraging increased pace and less contact

- Mike D’Antoni introducing 7 Seconds or Less

- Upsets in the late 2000s playoffs by teams built like the 2007 Warriors and 2009 Magic

- The Lakers’ championship success with Lamar Odom at the 4

- Dirk’s playoff run in 2011. The league’s best shooter - a big - surrounded by a herd of snipers

- Miami unlocking their offense by moving LeBron to the 4 in the 2012 playoffs

- The rise of Steph Curry and the Warriors

- D’Antoni/Harden’s “micro ball” Rockets (kind of TBD)

All of these events took place because of the success of a prior experiment. New experiments with these ideas involved similar aspects of prior ones with evolved strategy.

I received good response so I thought today I would continue this series with the top 5 shooting guards of all time. I made the mistake yesterday of including pre-modern nba players. Comparing pre-modern nba players is difficult because back then the competition was inferior, the game was played completely differently, and there is little footage available. Therefore, I encourage you to just focus primarily on modern nba players (those whose rookie season was 1970 onwards). Here's an initial list to get started, please let me know if I left anyone off:

\- George Gervin

\- Michael Jordan

\- Clyde Drexler

\- Reggie Miller

\- Ray Allen

\- Kobe Bryant

\- Allen Iverson

\- Tracy McGrady

\- Manu Ginobili

\- Dwyane Wade

\- James Harden

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like this list is a bit easier to construct compared to ranking the 5 best point guards. The first 2 spots feel pretty straightforward and after that it gets a little more tough. This is just my opinion, would love to hear your list:

1. Jordan- Should explain itself
2. Kobe- Once again easy ranking  

3. Wade- His peak might be shorter than others on this list as his game started to fall off once he turned 30. This is not to disrespect his accomplishments post 2010 as he continued to be a great sidekick for the majority of Lebron's tenure, ultimately culminating in 2 titles. However, his performance from 2005-2010 is what really earns him the number 3 spot. During these years, he averaged 27-7-5-2-1 on great efficiency, and was unlucky not to receive an MVP due to tough competition. The biggest highlight of that time was his title in 2006 where he put up one of the greatest postseason runs of all time carrying the Heat with a less than 100% Shaq who only averaged 14-10 in the finals.   

4. Harden- This might be a somewhat controversial ranking, as we've seen Harden's game not translate to the same level in the postseason but let me explain why I placed him here. Looking only at the regular season, I believe that him, Lebron, and Jordan are on their own tier for perimeter players when it comes to the combination of insane numbers + efficiency in the modern nba. Once joining the Rockets, he's put up 30-8-6 on 61% TS. The postseason (along with worse defense) is what puts him just behind Wade. When it comes to the postseason we are all very familiar with some of the struggles he's had, however the 28-7-6 on 57% TS is by no means bad. I also firmly believe had CP3 not gotten injured, the Rockets would have won the title in 2018. In other years, the supporting cast of the Rockets was nowhere near the level of the elite teams in the west (Warriors, Spurs, Thunder). If Harden can keep up a similar level of play the next few years, and slightly improve his postseason performance, I think he'll overtake Wade even without winning anymore titles or MVPs.  

5. AI- Believe it or not, as a Sixers fan I think AI is one of the more overrated players in history. On the court, he was inefficient and struggled playing with other star players. Off the court, his personality and style had a huge influence on fans' perception of his legacy. However with all that being said, the Sixers did him few favors when it came to building around him. After drafting him, they made a series of bad draft moves missing out on Billups, Mcgrady, Dirk, Pierce, Parker, Arenas, and more from 1997-2001. Eventually they did acquire star players like Mutombo and Webber, but unfortunately they were clearly past their primes. In Denver, he got the chance to play with another star player in his prime, however the fit never seemed to make much sense. Carmelo and AI are two of the most ball dominant iso scorers in the modern nba so they never seemed to be a good match. A large reason why AI made this list is because of his 2000-2001 nba season, where he carried a pretty terrible Sixers team to the nba finals, while giving the Lakers their only loss in those playoffs. That team was built well defensively, but offensively had almost no creation outside of AI. A 34 year old Mutombo was the second leading scorer on that team at 12 ppg. Just imagine if he had been put into the same system that Isaiah Thomas had in 2016-2017 with the Celtics, the sky would have been the limit for AI. This poor team construction along with his accolades (7x all-nba, 4x scoring title, 1x MVP) are what ultimately cause him to narrowly edge out Drexler for the final spot on this list.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,81080,public,self,How would you rank the top 5 shooting guards in NBA history?,0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/fwmuec/how_would_you_rank_the_top_5_shooting_guards_in/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

History is written by the victors. Robert Horry, affectionately titled Big Shot Bob, is remembered for hitting do-or-die shots on some of the best title teams of all time, including the Lakers early 2000s dynasty and Tim Duncan's Spurs. His heroics make you overlook his role player per game stats, his pedestrian efficiency, and his below average advanced metrics. 

But this is not an indictment of Robert Horry. This is a story about Sam Perkins, who was incredibly clutch, but almost never won.

Perkins did occasionally win. He was teammates with Michael Jordan at UNC and eventually became co-captain of 1984 Olympic gold medal team. When he got to the NBA, however, his teams had a habit of coming up short. He was drafted to the Dallas Mavericks in 1984, and joined the Lakers before the 1990-91 season. 

In Game 1 of the 1991 Finals, the Lakers found themselves down 2 on their final possession of the game. Magic Johnson backs down Michael Jordan in the post. The crowd is electric. He dribbles, he looks across...and he fires the ball to Sam Perkins, who is open at the 3 point line.

On a stage with Magic and Michael, Sam Perkins played the hero.

The Lakers would get man-handled the next four games, losing by a combined 51 points. Perkins put in more valiant efforts in Game 3 and Game 5, where he was the Lakers' highest scoring player yet again, but laid an egg in Game 4, shooting just 1/15 from the field. The Lakers were played off the court by the Bulls, in a series that marked the arrival of the Jordan Era. Perkins' Game 1 heroics were lost to history. 

1995-96. Perkins is now on the Sonics. He's clearly slowing down, but is playing valuable minutes as Seattle's sixth man. He's increased his production in the playoffs over his regular season totals. In Game 3 of the first round, Perkins puts in 17 off the bench to lead the Sonics. In Game 2 of the WCF, Perkins buried 3 of 4 threes, and all of his two-point attempts in a narrow win over the Jazz. Perkins led the team in scoring again in Game 4, a narrow 2-point victory in a series that would go the full seven.

Seattle would make it to the Finals, and run into Perkin's former teammate, Michael Jordan. No more heroics were to be found. In the close-out game 6, Perkins went 3/14, and the Sonics lost by double digits. 

1999-2000. Perkins isn't slowing down, he's just...slow, at this point. The 38 year old veteran is giving the Indiana Pacers 20 minutes a game, on a team that would make the Finals out of the Eastern Conference, to face the Lakers in their first title run with Shaq and Kobe. Perkins was a sniper the entire series, hitting 48% of his threes and taking 4 a game. With the Pacers down 2-1 in the series, Sam Perkins hits 3 threes, as well as this clutch shot in the final minute of regulation to tie the game, 104-104.

But if you hone into building a bench unit specifically, what is the best approach to it? I don't actually know if any of this matters, maybe teams just see a positional gap and try to fill it with the best possible player they can, but I'm wondering if it goes any deeper than that?

I think Bench Units are going to become even more important because the ideal roster construction seems to be shifting to valuing depth again over star power. Basically I think a Superstar, complimentary star, and depth are better than Big 3s with maxed out star power regardless of fit and lack of depth

Just brainstorming, I've thought of 3 different approaches teams can take to filling out their bench, so I'm wondering what you guys think would be the best of these, or if the best path is a mix of them, or if there's another path i'm not thinking of 

The 3 approaches I've come up with (the three Ps to make it catchier) are Parity, Puzzle Pieces, and Platoon

**Parity =** Is the best way to fill out your bench just to bring in replacement level versions of your starters, guys who can do a lot of the same things just at a lower level? 

Think if the Pelicans got Eric Paschall to fill in for Zion. He's kind of like a more regular human version of Zion who can do some of the same stuff and fill the same role, but at a lower level. Another example would be if the Rockets brought in Derrick Rose to be Westbrook's backup off the bench, considering he brings basically the same skillset to the table but just at a lower level? Does that add a beneficial element to a bench unit?

I thought about this approach specifically because of a prospect in this upcoming draft named Kira Lewis. He's a very similar player to Deaaron Fox and brings a lot of the same things to the table, but he's not really being a discussed as a potential franchise player like Fox was out of Kentucky. I'm wondering in the eyes of Sacramento decision makers, would he be more attractive to have on the team or less attractive? Does it help more to have a guy who can be like 70% of your starter and you can swap them out more seamlessly, or does it limit roster versatility if the starter and backup have the same skillset? Kira Lewis is crazy fast but not the greatest shooter, so does it help the Kings bench to have that constant pressure at the rim the entire game, or would it hurt them vs teams that can better neutralize Fox and guys like him?

Basically, would it be good to have your bench unit just be a B-, C+ version of your starting lineup?

**Puzzle Pieces =** Is the best way to fill out bench to get interchangeable pieces offer different things and that can be mixed and matched within your starting line up? 

An example of this would be Marcus Smart, hes not a full on bench player and plays starter minutes so maybe a little different, but he offers a completely different skillset than Kemba Walker while also being able to run an offense. So if the Celtics need to focus on getting stops they can sub out Walker for Smart. But Smart can also play alongside Kemba if needed

Another would be Livingston on the Warriors teams. He brought a completely different skillset than Steph, he was huge for a PG and held up better defensively, he was post scorer, and he could still play alongside steph and had versatility to play 1-3 situationally 

Another example would be San Antonio with their guards. It seems they started Derozan and Forbes primarily, with Murray, White, and Mills off the bench. Forbes, Mills, and Derozan are all more offensive players, Forbes and Patty bring similar skillsets as a good floor spacers, and Derozan is pretty much the opposite of that. White and Murray are really great defensive players. Idk how often the Spurs actually do mix match combos, I don't watch enough of them, but having all these guys gives them combos for different situations. If they need stops, roll with White+Murray. If they're down big and need a hail mary, throw Patty and Forbes. If Derozan's hot but has a bad defensive matchup, play one of the defensive guys with him to take it off his hands. Point is it gives them a lot of versatility and they can play a lot of different ways

Does this versatility make it the way to go? 

**Platoon =** Is the best way to fill our your bench unit to have a complete, cohesive that play well together, separate from your starters?

Think the Clippers. The starting lineup runs through through two star wings and they let Kawhi do a lot in isolation and midrange, and then they have a cohesive bench unit that comes in and it's almost like facing a different team. They run a lot of PnR with Lou and Montrezl and have Shamet and other interchangeable wings, so for other teams its almost as if you're facing two different offenses. Obviously this Clippers bench is a little bit of an exception because they may have the most talent in the league and their players can function as puzzle pieces too, but I think you get what I mean by a platoon system. 

The Raptors teams of the past few years have been similar, the Dallas bench this year was similar too. They go from a heliocentric offense running everything through Luka to a 3-ballhandler lineup. They were super successful as a bench unit this year too so is this the way to go?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Is it better to have a bench unit full of players that fills in for your starters, compliments them, or fit with each other as a separate unit

I particularly love hearing a unique point by someone used to present their candidate in a new way.  On the flip side, I generally hate hearing people talk about RINGZ and PPG.  Both arguments have been beaten to death since I was in elementary school, and I don't even think they're valid.

One argument in particular that I don't see brought up often enough are the GOAT candidates supporting casts.  For example, Kobe Bryant gets mentioned in a ton of people's top 10 but the rosters surrounding him during his title runs were legendarily good.  Conversely, he played on some pretty lousy rosters as well and, to me, he never seemed able to lift a lousy rosters from...well, being lousy.  LeBron James on the other hand has done some special things with sub par rosters.

I have no idea why people who rank Kobe so highly don't seriously dock him points for that.

So with all that being said, are there one or two GOAT candidates you think are undervalued significantly due to the rosters they were forced to play on?  Are there any GOAT candidates you think may be artificially overvalued because they played on exceptional rosters?

For me, Kobe is the overinflated guy, and Hakeem Olajuwan is my undervalued guy.  The NBA has had 74 seasons and only once has a player been able to win a title with zero Hall of Fame players and zero NBA All Stars.  That obviously being Hakeem Olajuwons 1994 title win.

*Complete side note / intro / monologue thing. I was flying to the west coast when I had a layover in Salt Like City. I truly thought I would never be in the state of Utah at any point in my life, but here I was, on my way. I am a horrible human being so I talk to people at airports and there was this one couple that was incredibly excited to be traveling to Utah. They had matching ‘We Love Utah’ shirts and I legitimately thought they were cops. They weren’t.*

*I started a casual conversation with them and would ask them why they love Utah so much. They would go on for a solid hour about the parks, the nature, the beauty of it and then, they spent a 1 minute on the Utah Jazz and I thought I had a conversation point with them. I asked them why they liked the Jazz, being the snarky asshole that I am while hiding the fact I had been a Wizards fan all of my life, and they mentioned how they met at a Western Conference Finals game. I was thinking they were talking about sometime in the 90s but that didn’t add up to their age. For a solid 10 minutes, I couldn’t think of the match-up and then I realized — they did it in the one year where it was one of the most unimportant series of that year. You had the ‘We Believe’ Warriors vs Mavs, Suns vs Spurs, and the LeBron James first real run in the playoffs. It was honestly the most Jazz thing to do, get to the western conference finals but barely remember it happened.*


We constantly live our sport lives pondering, “what if” statements. *What if X happened? What if Y happened?* Both a coping mechanism and fun to think about, it keeps our brain sharp and has made barstool conversations 100x more enjoyable. Then again, what if the “what ifs” happened? What if the cards fell into your favor, making what may seem like a dream  turn into a reality?


The 06-07 Jazz nearly had it happen with them.


Bridesmaids in the lore of professional basketball, the Utah Jazz could never get a championship. Their most talented rosters never felt like enough, always succumbing to a team that is simply greater. Then again, we usually want a championship team to be the best team at that period of time but you get the message I'm trying to say.
 

But during the mid-2000s, we never knew who was the best team at the time.  Basketball media would marvel at the unknown, due to the entertainment aspect, but also coddle in fear as their analysis could be meaningless in a matter of a series. They feature teams we mention in passing but never truly respected when talking about the greatest of the greats.


It would have been the perfect opportunity for the Jazz to win a title.

…

Bleacher Report once called Jerry Sloan a ‘tragic protagonist.’ It was an oddly beautiful description. He turned down his first coaching gig with his alma mater and 5 days later, the coaching staff would pass away in a tragic plane crash. His best line-up possibly ever ran into one of the greatest dynasties of all-time—the 90s Bulls. He would develop a reputation of pushing referees and a fiery personality. 


And he did this all in Utah.


After the Stockton-Malone era, the Jazz would prepare for the years of nothing. Expected to be the worst team in 2003-04, they weren’t. They would fight 8th with the Denver Nuggets, only to choke away their changes in the final two games. The next two seasons, 04-05 and 05-06, wouldn’t favor the Jazz as well, bringing expectations of the team back to reality. 


But 06-07, something was in the air. 


Jerry Sloan had developed a motion offense system that could compensate for weak players. His motion offense was fundamental basketball at its finest, he just needed the *right* person to guide it. 


A stud out of college, Deron Williams would go from one team that couldn’t finish the deal to another team that couldn't finish the deal. His first year was solid from a rookie point guard standard but the world was already beginning to realize that the man taken after him may be a tad bit special — Chris Paul. Then again, Jazz fans wouldn’t complain about what they were getting out of Williams.


He would be paired with veterans Carlos Boozer, Andrei Kirilenko, Derek Fisher, Matt Harpring and Mehemet Okur. But the team would also luck into some solid rookie bench talent with Ronnie Brewer, Paul Millsap and Dee Brown. 13 Utah Jazz players would make their appearance in a play-off game, which was just an impressive feat for a team that was projected to fall of the face of the year just a mere two seasons ago. 


Despite the Spurs win in 2005, the west not able to capture titles in 04 and 06, continuing a narrative that the west’s dominance was over. Kobe Bryant’s re-build of the Lakers was taking longer that expected, we still didn’t completely understand the power of Greg Popovich but we still hated the Spurs because of how good they were, and a player by the name of LeBron James was continuing to build his reputation was one of the league’s best. 


Entering the play-offs, the storyline in the west was simple — who would survive? You had a dominant Mavericks line-up with peak Dirk, the Suns were still incredibly talented, everyone still hated the Spurs, Yao and Tracy were (technically) healthy, Carmelo Anthony and Allen Iverson were teaming up, Kobe Bryant was in the play-off. Finally, the Utah Jazz and Golden State Warriors were also in the play-offs.


The Jazz weren’t favored to beat their first round opponent, the Houston Rockets. The Northwest Division of the west was much weaker than its siblings. But it was the perfect first round match-up for the Jazz. The Rockets still had no depth to their line-up. They hadn’t learn from their 2005 play-offs experience, then again, they didn’t have time to learn because of the health problems with Yao and Tracy.


Home court advantage would be the story for what was an overall ugly series. 6 games — 6 home team wins. No team would score over 100 points — which normally would lead into the favor of Yao and Tracy, but the lower scoring, grinding matches also meant a lot of minutes for the two stars. 


But the Rockets again would have their hearts broken in a Game 7. The Utah Jazz would start the game strong, thanks to Carlos Boozer but a second half resurrection from McGrady and Yao — who would account for 37 total second half points — meant the game would be close.


[With a one point lead with less than two minutes to go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NEAvvARppc), the Utah Jazz would take the ball out in their half-court. What felt like two straight plays meant to open up a pick-and-roll opportunity for Williams and Boozer, instead created two three-point opportunities for Mehmet Okur — the first one missing, the second one finding the bottom of the net.  


Yao’s two free-throws after a tough fall meant one solid defensive possession would give Tracy one last chance to make magic happen. Instead, Carlos Boozer’s fight on the boards would seal the fate of the Rockets. 35 points, 14 rebounds, 9 of 12 from the line secured a second round opportunity for the Jazz but more importantly, it was a second round opportunity against the Golden State Warriors. 


The nerds of the NBA universe would tell you they knew the Warriors would beat the Mavericks because they swept the regular season series. But in reality, it was the story of a perfect gameplan. Don Nelson knew Dirk inside and out. Despite our known legacy of Dirk, at times he would disappear in play-off series, even at the peak of his powers. Baron Davis would also proceed to have an all-time heat check playoff performance run that would secure the deal. Plus, Mark Cuban also had a weird unshaven 5 o’clock shadow thing going, it didn’t really matter, I just find it funny looking back at Mark Cuban’s ‘looks’ when the Mavericks lost in the mid-2000s.


Its also why the Warriors didn’t stand much of a chance against the Jazz. Don Nelson didn't know the Jazz. They would battle and more importantly entertain with their style of playing—[including a memorable game 3 dunk from Baron Davis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jsM-lVfFyg). But it didn’t feel like the Warriors had the strength to get through Utah alive. It was still entertaining. 


Game 1 was a Deron Williams coming out party. His 31 points put to to shame the shootout attempts from Matt Barnes, Jason Richardson and Baron Davis. The lack of 'board men' from the Warriors meant Carlos Boozer could stat pad all he wanted, racking up 20 total rebounds, 10 offensive and 10 defensive, along with Mehmet Okur’s 11 rebounds. Matt Harpring and Andrei Kirilenko would provide solid mid-range support and Utah looked solid. 


The game would still be close going into the final moments. Baron Davis's 17 points in the second quarter gave the Warriors a boost that some would think would last until the  end of the game — producing two 30+ point quarters as a team. But Jason Richardson couldn’t carry the weight of his teammates — who couldn’t battle against the size and swiftness in the 4th quarter. 


A tied game with less than 20 seconds to go, Mehmet Okur would again get a three point look, this time alone in the corner, and again, Carlos Boozer would pick-up his rebound and score the contested two. A missed three point shot with 10 seconds to go gave the Jazz the cushion to push forward in a series that felt immediately like a mountain the Warriors couldn’t climb over. 


Game 2 would again, be another thriller. If the Warriors were going to win, it would have to be on the back of Baron Davis. If the Jazz were going to win, it didn’t have to be through one guy. Its why AK47 being a point guard for a period of time in game 2 made sense…Kind of. 


Derek Fisher would also have a storybook moment, returning to the team following his daughter’s illness. Deron Williams was in foul trouble, Dee Brown had a scary injury so as Derek Fisher arrived in the area, he would suit up and immediately join the game. His 5 points in the game didn’t feel memorable on the stats sheet but it was memorable in the hearts of Utah, which is all that truly matters.


The fourth quarter would feature another disappearing act from Baron Davis — this time through his missed free throws. And when he wasn’t able to win the game for the Warriors in the final moments, overtime did not seem optimal.  The Utah Jazz would enter the overtime will all of their cards on the table, able to play without fear. 14 points to 4 in OT in a winnable game 4 for the Warriors felt like a morale breaker, even with the knowledge that their return to Oracle Arena would be a much needed morale booster. 


The Warriors couldn’t be screwed on the boards if they didn’t miss shots. 70 points at half time, the Warriors needed the pop-off performance. 52.6% from the field, 47% from deep and they would only be out-rebounded by 15. It felt like a complete win.

And then game 4 felt like the Warriors realized the boss they thought they defeated had a second form. 


Despite having a 3-point lead entering the fourth, they wouldn’t be prepared for a *40-point onslaught* that would happen. 14 points from Derek Fisher, 12 from Okur were enough to outscore the Warriors. Deron, Boozer and Kirilenko providing the cherry on top gave the Jazz a nice 14 point game 4 lead and prepared the probable game 5 victory.


It would have felt a lot cleaner if Deron Williams didn’t return to Earth as a point guard. Despite have an incredible play-offs so far, his foul trouble and unfortunate injuries plagued the Jazz—even with the crafty maneuvers of a bigger line-up from Sloan. His two early fouls game the Warriors a chance, especially with Monta Ellis doing work on the offensive end. 


But the Warriors would implode in the third quarter. The ball simply wouldn’t go in the basket. Davis, Jackson, Richardson, Ellis, Barnes would combine for 2 made baskets on 16 attempts. Williams would fight through foul trouble for the Jazz and the length of the Jazz was too much. AK47 would have one of his better games of a disappointing season, recording the double-double, Boozer and Okur were still dominating the front court. Miracles couldn’t beat strength.


It would set up a western conference finals that would put the world to sleep, so much so that ESPN nearly — they still didn’t because it is ESPN — had hockey as its first highlight on SportsCenter. Juxtaposed with LeBron versus the Pistons in the east, it was a tough one to watch. But was it a winnable one for the Jazz?


No. 


The Spurs had the Jazz’s number. ESPN would show a stat that the Spurs were 16-0 home against the Jazz in their last sixteen. Not a good look for a team that would have to win one on the road. The Spurs had battled against the Suns and would come out on top. Everyone remembers this as the series as the one where the Suns got screwed by poor officiating and bullshit NBA rules.. It also could have been spin zoned as the series that screwed the Jazz. They had a good balance of size and swiftness were they would want to push the pace while also having the ability to slow it down when they needed to against a smaller line-up.


Sometimes, you just realize your luck runs out. The Spurs weren’t a good match-up for the Jazz — they were everything the Jazz were but simply better. Despite Boozer and Williams being great in the series, Kirilenko and Okur couldn’t find the consistency to be the third key member of the Jazz to battle against three legends in Duncan, Parker and Ginobili. 


A frustrating game 3 for Tim Duncan — who would account for 8 turnovers, provided hope in a loveless place. The Jazz couldn’t win on the road but they could win at home against the Spurs. 

However in game 4, the Spurs would return the favor. Questionable foul calls against the Jazz nearly lead to the refs being pushed. Manu’s ability to get Fish and Deron Williams into foul trouble nearly sealed the fate for the Jazz, who would have to wait one more game to depart from the play-offs. 

And even though the Jazz didn’t make the finals and had effectively met their match, the story of the team deserves some recognition. 


A 1-8 first round miracle is impressive but a 5 seed with little expectations nearly fighting their way into the NBA Finals would have been an incredible story. The peak of the Jazz powers would never line-up in the order that would establish them as a force to be reckoned with in the west. They wouldn’t make moves to change their history, they seemed okay with mediocrity. And as other forces around them would emerge and takeover, they would slowly fall to the wayside. 

…

My co-worker that may never get married, always talks about how she loves being the bridesmaid at weddings. She would spin zone it as her being able to tell the stories of the relationships, the memories of the events and being apart of the story. *I might not be in the dress, but I’m in the pictures.* 


The mid 2000s Jazz were indeed in the pictures. Not expected to be the one to catch the bouquet and find the man of their dreams, they would sit through the bumpy road that was the reconfiguring of the western conference. Jerry Sloan’s ability to turn trash into less trash was a feat of is own and likely won’t get the 30-for-30 recognition, the chapter in a book of basketball and probably won’t even get mentioned in a highlight package.

Plus, Lauri has struggled with injuries and maybe his situation is worsened by the Bulls' lackluster medical staff.

LeVert has also struggled with injuries and shows flashes of great potential, but there are questions about his fit with the Nets due to Kyrie and Durant taking scoring duties.

Gordon is a PF/SF tweener who fits awkwardly next to Jonathan Isaac. I don't know much about the Magic, so I can't speak much about his situation but I've seen fans murmuring about him.

Regardless of what your thoughts on him as a player are, nobody can deny that he was a generational talent and an all time great. However, deciding where he falls in the goat hierarchy has always been a subject of debate. 

When it comes to Kobe, the stats aren’t what impresses me. He had plenty of excellent seasons, both by standard statistical measures and the advanced ones. But to me, Kobe Bryant is forever going to be engraved in nba history not because of numbers. But because of his pure mastery of the game of basketball. When I watch Kobe, I’m amazed by his footwork. By his balance. By his body control even in mid air or fading from the basket. By his first step quickness. By his off hand dribbling. By his ability to make shots regardless of the defensive pressure. And the list goes on.

But there’s no statistic that can quantify these intangible skills. And it’s these skills that make me a firm believer in the eye test argument when judging a players greatness. Now, just as stats aren’t an end all be all, neither is the eye test. But I’ve seen quite a few people on this sub who disregard the power of vision while treating statistics like they’re an infallible source of basketball objectivity.

So this begs the question: how much should we weigh unquantifiable skill vs quantifiable stats? I’m a believer in both. But as with all measurements, you need to figure out what works best for the sample that you are trying to measure. In the case of a player like Kobe, I firmly believe that statistics do not do him justice. Because what made Kobe great were those intangible skills that can only be measured by a person’s sight. 

I’m just looking for some thoughts on this. Keep it civil. Keep it clean. I’ve dealt with plenty of people in this sub who like to attack my stance on Kobe because of a disagreement in the power of vision.

His longevity is lacking, however his 5 titles, 3 mvps, and 10 all-nba appearances is super impressive. From 2-5 I think it becomes very difficult to rank who goes where. Here are the strongest candidates for these spots:

\- Oscar Robertson

\- Old Isiah Thomas

\- John Stockton

\- Jason Kidd

\- Steve Nash

\- Chris Paul

\- Steph Curry

I think creating this ranking is very tough for a number of reasons. First, you have guys like Nash, Paul, and Stockton who were all incredible players that could elevate their team but were unable to win titles due to facing some great teams (Spurs, Lakers, Bulls).  

Second, you have players who benefited from the environment they were in. For example, you have a player like Oscar who put up incredible numbers but played against weaker competition, and had little team success before Kareem came. Another example is the system that Nash was apart of on the Suns. Don't get me wrong Nash was incredible and deserved his MVPs but what if a prime Chris Paul ended up in that same situation, would he also have won those MVPs?

Third, ranking Steph is tough because he still has many years left in his career before he retires. The start of his career is less impressive than probably anyone else on this list except Nash, but from 2014 onwards he's won 3 titles and 2 MVPs. His 2015-16 season is probably one of the 5 greatest individual seasons of all time.

2. Steph (assuming he'll be a top 10 nba player for a few more years even without winning more titles)

How has your team done? Do you trust your GM with a top 10 pick? I understand that it\'s not entirely fair, just because a lot happens over the course of 10 years. Coaching and management regimes change. Contenders rise and fall. You look at Detroit and you see that while it\'s a ""top 10 picks"" list, all of their picks were 7-9, while Cleveland had a similar number of picks but had 3 #1 overall picks.

I think he should very well be in the conversation, and I have no issue with individuals listing him in the top 10. My issue is that there is a growing sentiment that his place in history cannot be argued or debated on. Every player's legacy should be up for debate, if the debate is to talk about who the best of all time is.**

Preparing for downvotes, but I'm just going to post some Kobe stats from Basketball Reference.

In my view, Kobe is a fringe top-20 candidate. Now, if you want to argue for him to be a top-10 candidate, that's fine, but I really don't understand why consensus says he's must be top 10. I appreciate his tenacity and skill, but he wasn't the all-around player the press made/makes him out to be. He was probably the best of the isolation-focused wings, but that player type has always been over-valued (guys like McGrady, Vince Carter, etc.). He's a proven winner, and a tremendous volume scorer, but he was a mediocre (and at times, downright bad) shooter, mediocre-to-bad facilitator, and his defense regressed, even in his prime. He peaked as a defender early in his career (as many guards tend to), and he didn't really sustain elite-level defense for very long anyways.


He was often the best player on very good teams, and his high usage meant he was always the focal point. Kobe and Shaq were 1a and 1b at the very least, and he was clearly the best player on those late-decade teams, but let's not pretend he carried his team single-handedly. Gasol, Odom, and Artest formed one of the most fearsome defensive units of the decade, and formed that was, at least for a short-while, arguably the most talented starting line-up in the league. I don't usually follow the ""rings"" argument, as rings are all about team context anyways. Jordan only won with a historic team backing him up, same as all the Spurs teams, the Celtics and Lakers teams in the 80s, and so-on. Talking about ""rings"" doesn't really prove anything about an individual's skill set, anyways.

Now, I know some will say advanced stats mean nothing without context, and you can pick apart individual ones for their effectiveness, but I do think when you take them all together, you do develop a ""sense"" where that player should be placed. For the ""eye test"" arguers, I grew up watching him play. I was equally dazzled by his relentless scoring abilities as I was baffled by his lack of situational awareness and horse-blinders court-vision. I understand his importance to the league and his place in league history. He's definitely a top-5 iconic player for sure. But I just can't wrap my head around him being consensus top 10 all-time.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,80959,public,self,An Argument Against the Consensus that Kobe is a Top-10 all-time player.,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/fvm3ml/an_argument_against_the_consensus_that_kobe_is_a/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, I don't think it's rational to measure a players value based on individual statistics.  I think we should measure them based on their impact on the team.  Most agree that defensive impact doesn't translate to statistics very well and Hakeem Olojuwan might be the greatest defensive player in the history of the game playing the most valuable defensive position in basketball (the 5).  So with that being said let's look at Hakeems impact...

The 85/86 Rockets went 44-24 with Hakeem and 6-7 without him.

The 86/87 Rockets went 40-34 with Hakeem and 2-5 without him.

The 91/92 Rockets went 40-30 with Hakeem and 2-10 without him.

The 94/95 Rockets 44-28 with Hakeem and 3-7 without him.

The 95/96 Rockets went 47-25 with Hakeem and 1-9 without him.

Now there is one outlier year in 1990/1991 when Olojuwan failed to earn an All Star nod and his with/without impact was completely neutral over 16 games.

Michael Jordan on the other hand was a much more durable player but we do see some instances of how his play impacted the Bulls.

The Bulls went 27-55 without Jordan before drafting him.

Then the Bulls went 38-44 during his Rookie of the Year campaign.  An improvement of +11 games.

Then Jordan gets hurt during his sophomore season and the Bulls go 30-52 that year.  A backslide of -8 games.

Then Jordan returns for his third year and the Bills go 40-42, which is a +10 game improvement.

Fast forward to Jordans surprise retirement and the Bulls add a rookie (and quite terrible) Tony Kukoc as well as Steve Kerr and the Bulls go 55-27 which is two wins fewer than the previous Jordan led year.

Like Olojuwan, Jordan also has interesting outlier data when he returned for the last 17 games of the 1994 season and improve the 34-31 Bulls to a 47-35 final record.  But you could attribute that to Jordan being well rested, joining the Bulls at the end of the season when teams are tired, and the crazy energy that filled the arena with Jordans return.

Jordan was great no doubt, but looking at the above data it seems clear that Olojuwan helps his teams significantly more so than Jordan did.  Isn't it entirely possible that Jordan was merely a top 5 player in the history of the NBA and just took advantage of playing on significantly better rosters than players like Hakeem Olojuwan?  

Not that this matters but it's interesting to note that Hakeem was 13-10 against Jordan for their careers.  He was 7-2 against Jordans Bulls during the Rockets two year prime and the Houston Rockets swept the Orlando Magic, who beat the Jordan led Bulls in 6 during the previous playoff series, in which Jordan was playing out of his mind.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,80954,public,self,Was Hakeem Olojuwan better than Michael Jordan?,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/fvh98k/was_hakeem_olojuwan_better_than_michael_jordan/,some_ads,7,,,099e778a-8b9a-11e8-b53d-0eebf66bed8a,Player Discussion,,,,,,,,,,,

I've heard the East was a better conference than the west but looking bball reference it seems that the west had the advantage. I wasn't born yet so here's my take:

Looking at the teams Jordan played in the ECF: Pistons, Cavs, Knicks, Orlando, Heat, Pacers

Finals: Lakers, Blazers, Suns, Sonics, Jazz, Jazz

Who wins: Lakers over pistons in 5, Blazers over cavs in 6, Jazz over heat and pacers both in 6

Toss up: Knicks and suns in 93, Orlando and sonics in 96

I feel as if the west had at least 3 teams back then that could win a title rather the east just have 1 other team rather than Jordan win it in certain years.

It wasn’t because I liked Yao Ming. I wasn’t a Rockets fan and honestly, at the time, I didn’t realize just how good Yao Ming was. As an east coast child, I didn’t realize teams existed in the west outside of the Spurs and the Lakers — those were the only two teams that mattered in my view. And Houston was supposed to change that, or at least join the picture. So when a bingo night in elementary school lead to me now owning a Yao Ming poster, I guess I had to watch him.


It was perfect timing because that was the 2004-05 Houston Rockets season and more importantly, it was the one healthy year we got of Yao Ming and Tracy McGrady.

----
We start back in 1999. In his late teens, Yao Ming would be pressured to make the move to America and join the association. Being pressured by the management of the Shanghai Sharks, he would consider the option but would wait until 2002 to make the move. Partially because of horrible contracts with an agency, partially because he stock would skyrocket with time. 


He would literally have a group of advisers to monitor his value, the Chinese government would have investment in the young man — including their creation of regulations to take money out of Ming’s pockets. Seriously, the whole situation of how Yao Ming was brought over to the NBA is incredibly fascinating and a little bit depressing. The lack of a oral history on the situation or some 30-for-30 is surprising. 


Yao was not the consensus overall first pick that year from a talent perspective. From the college level, you had the incredible Duke team that choked against Indiana in March Madness — leading to Maryland winning it all (never forget). It was thought that Jay Williams, being the greatest college basketball point guard of all-time, could go first overall. However, the Chinese basketball market was lucrative. You weren't necessarily drafting Yao for Yao. You were drafting Yao for China. 


So Yao would go first overall. He had to. You had to have a formal letter from the Shanghai Sharks that you could draft him. 


His first year wouldn’t officially start until he faced a healthy Shaq in January, where he would go pound-for-pound with the man that had attempted to bury his career with his words. Yao wouldn't be taken seriously until he met a real threat- similar to how fighters aren't taken seriously until they meet a proper match. O’Neal would start the game, attempting to cross over Yao Ming in the left corner only to be met by the right hand of Yao Ming stopping his shop. It was an incredibly cocky move with an incredibly poor execution. The next possession, you knew the Rockets would return the favor—getting the ball to Yao in the low post. However, Ming would go with the soft hook for two. 


Ming was real. 


He would get beat out for Rookie of the Year by Amar’e Stoudamire — in which both players deserved the award but, you know, reasons lead for  Stoudamire to get the nod. Seriously, it was a weird year where you would see a lot of questionable comments from ESPN writers, O’Neal and they would play it off as not racist—and Yao would agree — but you could also see why it was interpreted that way.


The Rockets would miss the play-offs by one game but still, the 15-game improvement was a sign of greater things to come. And when Rudy Tomjanovich had to resign due to bladder cancer, it was a blessing in disguise.


Jeff Van Gundy would take over the ropes and develop the system around Yao, truly looking to get the most of the out of big man. It would work because they would make the play-offs in his first season as head coach, only to exit the first round against the Lakers. Van Gundy's usage of a 2-man game was all Yao truly needed -- having him work off of screens or in the low post. 


So entering the summer of 2004, the Rockets had time to think. The team clearly wanted to go all-in around Yao, who would be their target?


---

Tracy McGrady was not happy in Orlando. 


The man that managed to win back-to-back scoring titles on the Magic, despite the team missing the play-offs in 03-04, wanted out. Injuries had plagued the team and Doc Rivers’ departure mid-season meant the team didn’t sit well with the man in his prime. His confused for why this team sucked so much and why management wasn't doing anything to assist made sense. 


McGrady had established himself as one of the best players in the league and requesting a trade was huge news. It would be even crazier because Orlando would have the first pick in the draft and would select a man named Dwight Howard. He really did want out.


The timing was perfect for Houston. Steve Francis didn’t like the changes Van Gundy was making which meant his name was available. Despite being an incredible guard, he would be traded—along with his best friend on the team Cuttino Mobley, and Kelvin Cato’s bad contract—to Orlando for T-Mac, Juwan Howard’s bad contract, Tyronn Lue and Reece Gaines. 


It was a mega move but a move to hopefully stop the dominance of the two teams in the West. It was meant to change the tides of time.


It worked to a degree. 

---
The regular season would start off slow. McGrady was different from the previous backcourt, which meant there was a learning curve to the Van Gundy offense. Tracy’s ability to be strong on the boards was a nice addition but also took away some of the thunder Yao brought. Van Gundy’s vision of building around Yao slowly became a vision of McGrady and Yao coexisting in the same system, which meant a lot spacing for the scoring star while setting Yao in a position to succeed in the post. Incorporating more isolation opportunities for McGrady as well as still using Yao's presence early on in a possession would be the fix. 


Tracy would have his career defining moment of 13 points in 33 seconds against the Spurs on December 9th, the team would slowly come to form earning a play-off spot as the 3rd seed in the Southwest division and more importantly, things were looking good for Houston.


The Rockets were seen as championship contenders but possibly in a tier below the remaining old guard. They were a defensive team that would rely on McGrady and Yao to score nearly all of their points and it would work. It would make sense because here was their starting line-up going into the play-offs: McGrady, David Wesley, Ryan Bowen, Bob Sura and Yao.  Jon Barry, Mike James and Dikembe would come off the bench. This wasn’t your prototypical championship caliber team, it was the hope that two incredible players could do incredible things.


But the Western conference was open for the taking. Shaq was out of Los Angeles and was now in the East — meaning Yao would be relatively uncontested in the low post. The Phoenix Suns would sign an unrestricted free agent named Steve Nash and would pair him with their new coach — Mike D’Antoni-- and Amar'e. The ‘Malice at the Palace’ would happen. The Wizards and the Bulls would make the play-offs in the east and the Lakers would miss the play-offs. It was an underrated crazy season. 


Which meant a first round match-up between Dallas and Houston would be a must watch. I found out recently that Houston and Dallas fans hate each other which meant that the I-45 match-up wouldn’t be your every day battle. 


Dallas had an up-and-down year. Don Nelson would step-down mid-season and Avery Johnson would takeover. Under Johnson, they would win their final nine to earn the second spot in the Southwest division and a 4 seed in the West. The match-up was even and more importantly, they could avoid the Spurs in the second round. But first, they had to get through each other.


Game 1 would take place in Dallas but you thought it would have been McGrady’s court at home. A pissed-off Mark Cuban with long hair would have to watch McGrady for 51.9% from the field, on 27 shots, scoring 34 points in 46 minutes. Early foul trouble on Yao wouldn’t matter as Dirk Nowitzki couldn’t find his form, going 5 for 19 from the field.


Dallas couldn’t match-up with the size differences McGrady and Yao brought to their roles. At times, it felt like Johnson was testing to figure out what he could do — sometimes having Dirk guard Yao and immediately regretting that decision. And as much as they would focus on Yao in the early stages, Tracy would just be dominating Stackhouse, Terry, Finley, [Dirk](https://youtu.be/yPsURFSVpmo?t=90) whoever they had on the court.


They had to figure it out fast because Yao wouldn’t get the calls that would limit his game 1 performance. *Right….*


At least they wouldn’t in Game 2. Yao Ming would start off the first quarter going 5 for 5 from the field, 7 for 7 from the line and only committing one foul. Meanwhile, Tracy had a hefty 10 points to start the game as [well as an incredible and-one](https://youtu.be/rK6galQrajw?t=69). Dallas was able to keep it close with 30 points in an overall team effort but they to stop the Rockets from blasting off. 


The fouls would come again. Tracy would have 3 fouls but more importantly, the Rockets were fouling Dirk. It would become a common theme that Dirk would draw fouls. Dirk would get foul with his signature jumper—refs would think there would be contact when in reality, Dirk was incredible at spacing himself. Dirk was used to getting to the stripe 5-7 times a game. this series, he would see the line 13, 12, 10, 9, and 9 times respectively -- which felt kind of unreal. 


It was a physical series — as you would expect with the play-offs — but at times, the fouls didn’t fit the crimes at times. Fans would become upset and did lead to match-fixing allegations down the line. 


The second half adjustment from the Mavericks would finally give them a lead. If they could get the ball away from Yao and McGrady, it would force other places on the Rockets to make shots. It was a good idea.The duo would only combine for 10 field goal attempts but as fouls would linger on McGrady and Yao, their defensive efforts would be limited. Meanwhile, Dirk would have a quiet third quarter, possibly bracing for what would be a war in the fourth. 


All that would matter would be the last 30-seconds of the game. The quarter would feature the match-up we all expected, Dirk versus Yao and Tracy but missed shots from Jason Terry, Finley and Howard gave a little less support to Dirk from the solid role-player work of Bob Sura, Jon Barry and Mike James. 

 [Dallas would have the ball down 2 with 29.3 after a missed jumper from Tracy](https://youtu.be/I5XRN4KvYJ8?t=19). Dirk would get the ball at the right elbow after a screen, leading to Tracy taking on the 7 footer. In a vintage dirk move, he would dribble to the middle of the paint, spin his back to the basket and rotate out into a fadeaway that only Dirk would do. It was a free two-points.

Houston would intentionally not call a timeout and force Dallas to react to what was in front of them. The world knew that Yao or Tracy would take the final shot, the question was how. Exactly how you would want it, a high screen from Yao with the floor spaced lead to a free look from just inside the three-point line. He wouldn’t miss.


What felt like an iconic moment was Yao running like a giraffe to hug Tracy, only to be contrasted by another pissed off image of long haired Mark Cuban. TNT would run a statistic that Houston Rockets were 7-0 all-time when they lead a series 2-0. And with 2.2 seconds left, Dirk would not get the ball but Michael Finley would and his jumper would not go.  


The basketball universe was in flux. The night before, the Nuggets took a game off of the Spurs. Now, the Rockets were up 2-0 to the favored Mavericks. Something wasn’t right in the world. 


The Mavericks knew they would have to win game 3 and avoid criticism of being a team that simply got hot late in the season. Both teams would battle it out early, totaling 12 fouls and 9 turnovers. Yao again would be plagued by early, questionable fouls but the Mavericks would only be able to take advantage of his foul trouble late in the quarter, getting a much needed 5 point lead.  


The second quarter would not be prettier as fouls and turnovers continued to add up.Dirk  and Tracy would account for 40% of the total points in that quarter. The bigger problem came with Dikembe, Ryan Bowen and Yao all having 3 fouls in the first half, limiting the threat of size on the Rockets that they used so well to their advantage. One of them would be punished.


Bowen’s 2 fouls added more to the fire and his replacement, Scott Padgett, managed to rack up 3 fouls as his replacement in 10 minutes. But the Rockets were able to get back into the game. Tracy, Yao and David Wesley accounted for 24 points while Dirk searched for his teammates as Terry, Dampier and Josh Howard would go scoreless. Jerry Stackhouse’s 7 points eased the pain but a 10 point differential in the third quarter gave the Rockets the lead. 


But Dirk didn’t know what a shadow looked like. He couldn’t stand in the shadow of the Tracy and Yao show. With 8:14 to go, Dallas would go on an 18-0 run as Yao and Bowen would foul out. Tracy would go 1 for 5 in the fourth and a quarter that would only have the Rockets score 19 points felt like the Mavericks were finally making their appearance in the playoffs. 


Game 4 was up for grabs. Slowly, questions regarding the officiating began to take place. It was an underlying storyline to the series that it felt as if there were questionable calls made — both ways. And with all of the light shining on the stars, people were watching the calls closely. 


The first half would feature much of the same. Two early fouls from Yao would limit his performance but Tracy would still finish the first half with 17 points. Meanwhile, Dirk  was still killing the Rockets from the line — despite shooting 2 of 7 from the field — and he was getting needed support from Finley, Terry, Howard and Stackhouse. A 3-point lead for the Rockets to finish the half wasn’t going to be enough, we all knew there would need to be a spark in the second half to determine the fate of Game 4.


That spark plug would be The JET. Jason Terry wasn’t having an incredible series. But with Dirk struggling again in the second half, the Mavs needed someone to step up to numb the pain that would be 30 points from Yao and Tracy in the second half. 


Terry would go 8 for 13, 5 for 7 from deep and more importantly, only commit 2 turnovers. The big men from both teams getting into foul trouble meant that the floor would become incredibly wide open, allowing for scorers to do what they do best.


[Dallas would have a 1 point lead with 45 seconds to-go and as Jason Terry brought up the ball](https://youtu.be/IZIyBeHTJe8?t=193), it was the rare situation where you knew Dirk would not be getting the ball. Tracy would pick-up Dirk however a high screen would lead to McGrady guarding Terry out on the wing. It felt like the perfect situation for the Rockets as McGrady would stop the drive from Terry and force him to keep dribbling.  


As JT would bring the ball back to around the perimeter, McGrady poked the ball, leading to a scramble at the top of key. High in the sky, the ball would fall into the hands of Dirk, who would kick it out to Terry, alone on the wing. And the hot man stayed hot, drilling the three point shot and leaving the Rockets with their hands on their heads. The stars aligned for Dallas. 


It was a heart breaker in Houston. Game 5 would feel like a forecasted loss. Tracy McGrady couldn’t find his shot in the first half — going 4 for 12 from the field and getting 13 points. Meanwhile, the Mavericks' success was a continued team effort, even with Jason Terry returning back to earth with his 0 shots made in the first half. 


Things would stay the same except this time, the beast from the far east was awoken. 22 points in the second half, 15 points in the fourth kept things interesting. But his 3 of 8 shooting from the line in the fourth was as disastrous as Tracy McGrady’s shooting. Every opportunity the Rockets would do to keep the game close, the Mavs would match it. The 3 point loss wasn’t as heartbreaking as people thought, as Tracy was simply having an off night, but it would mean we could expect to see Game 7. 


Game 6 wouldn’t start the way the Rockets were expecting.Tracy would start off hot — 5 for 7 from the field, but his team would struggle. 2 fouls early again for Yao removed some of the scoring potential of the Rockets and they would only score 18 points — mitigating Dirk’s poor start once again. 


They would pop-off in the second quarter, thanks to Mike James’ 13 points and Tracy’s 9 but more importantly, the collective of the Mavericks couldn’t find the bottom of the nets.But the half-time break would again shift things. Dirk was still terrible but Michael Finley made his presence known with 10 points.Tracy and Yao would struggle from the field and again, the lead was back into the hands of Dallas.


And, as the story goes with this game, it meant the Rockets were going to have hot 4th — which they did. But the Mavericks would also only score 13 points in the 4th. Yao and Bob Sura wouldn’t play in the 4th, Jon Barry would have 12, Mike James would have 9 and Tracy would seal the deal with 11. It was an ugly game, one you sort of just want to forget when you’re entering a Game 7 environment. It was the clown act between two redneck demolition derbies. 


The stage was set. Two teams that did not like each other, in a physical series, would get a chance to break each other’s hearts. You would think it would be an incredible bruiser game, battle to the end. 


It was not. 


A game that would require Yao and Tracy to be at their best simply would not work in their favor. Their star efforts weren’t enough in a team environment. Now, I should mention that Tracy struggled to start the game — going 3 for 9 from the field and Dirk was again struggling with his 4 first-quarter points. But only 3 players on the rockets scored in the first quarter — compared to 6 from the Macs.


A 12-point cushion to start a Game 7 usually doesn’t feel like it can last, except for this time. It felt like it would last in this game. Tracy and Yao scoring a combined 20 points would normally mean that the Rockets were on their way back but Jason Terry would again, be a critical spark plug with 15 points in the second. Yao would also return to foul trouble with 3 fouls in the first half and elimination continued to creep. Yao would have to battle through the third quarter despite picking up his fourth however it wasn’t much help because again, the team of the Dallas Mavericks was greater than the two of the Rockets. This time Yao, Tracy and Scott Padgett would be the only 3 to record points in the third while 7 Maverick players would produce points on the scoreboards. 


The Rockets were begging for foul calls but weren’t getting them.  They would only get to the stripe 7 times in the first half. The Mavs: 17 times. General frustration, the depression that comes with possibly being eliminated remained in the minds of the Rockets during the second half. 


Yao’s 33, Tracy’s 27 weren’t enough. The 16-point performance from the rest of their teammates was the story of this roster. Jason Terry’s 31, Josh Howard’s 21 and respectable 13 and 14 points from Finley and Dirk would lead to the departure of the Rockets from the play-offs, in what was a brutal end to the first season of Yao and Tracy.


Dallas would go on to lose to the Phoenix Suns that showed they were real western conference contenders  but more importantly, it felt like they broke Houston’s chances at being one of the top teams in the west. The following season would be a waste as both Tracy and Yao missed a significant amount of games due to injury. The roster would continued to survive and but also continue to struggle to make it out of the first round. And when they did, it was 2009 where Tracy would have a season-ending knee injury, Ron Artest would be on the team and Yao Ming would miss the second round match-up against the Lakers and would cost the team an opportunity at the Western Conference finals.


It was unfortunate we never saw a second opportunity but then again, I don’t know if it would be a better performance. The Rockets wouldn’t be able to add support for the duo, a coaching change would stall the progression Van Gundy had made and more importantly, the duo would never rebound from health issues. Despite the greatness in skills, the cards weren't in their favor.


Instead, they will remain one of the biggest what-ifs in our basketball life time. Two hall of famers wouldn’t be able to get out of the first round at their peaks. Instead, the good fortune would shift to the Dallas who would find success as one of the best during the period of time where Kobe would re-build Los Angeles, San Antonio would do San Antonio things, and we had the house of the rising suns in Phoenix. Utah and Memphis would remain staples as the team that ""might do it this year"" and it would last us until a group of three players would kick off the start of a new generation of basketball in Oklahoma City.

Hey everyone - I used my biomechanics and youth basketball coaching background to break down Steph's unprecedented deep shooting ability and the key technique underlying that success. Thanks to the mods for letting me post.

Here’s a table of contents, header (sub-headings):

\- 0:00 Intro

\- 0:23 Deep shooting form

\- 1:13 Jumper rhythm and timing (a “noisy’ variable, internal interference)

\- 4:11 The upshot

For those at work or the hard of hearing, I've transcribed subtitles on YouTube so sound isn't required.

Summary (will do my best to describe the visuals): Steph Curry’s shooting range and ability to hit deep three’s is nothing quite like we’ve seen before. Many players when shooting from distance tend to go into a deeper initial dip but Steph Curry, according to an ESPN Sport Science measured analysis on his shot from 30+ feet out, found that the he only thing he changes on his form is faster wrist flexion velocity (wrist snap). This is critical for multiple reasons. The first is related to jumper timing and rhythm. A jumper is a very sensitive series of sequential movements/variables and a deeper dip is what I call a “noisy variable”, meaning it leads to significant downstream effects. That’s because it occurs early on in the foundational part of the jumper sequence and it requires moving/loading multiple joints and muscles. In contrast, Steph’s wrist snap technique is a “quiet variable” because it’s at the end of the jumper sequence and only requires a change in forearm flexor activation. The second reason is “internal interference” aka when a player thinks about their own mechanics while shooting which interrupts their pre-established pathways. During larger scale, earlier in movement sequence changes - like the dip - players tend to think more about the change (“oh, I’m pretty dang far away. Let me load my legs more”) versus smaller scale, later in the movement sequence changes - like Steph’s wrist snap change - where he’s still in rhythm. All in all, Steph changing only a small variable in his deeper shooting form allows him to maintain his form consistency, rhythm/timing, and not overthink the shot - the result is the best deep shooter we’ve ever seen.

You can't really be a top 20 player of all time with just 5-6 elite seasons. On the other hand, rack up 20 all-star seasons (but never MVP-caliber), and you might just find yourself soaring up the ranks. I think longevity is rather overrated over peak, however, and here's why:

Since the ABA-NBA merger, 32 of the 43 championships teams have had Kareem/Magic, Bird, MJ, Hakeem, Duncan, Kobe/Shaq, LeBron, or Steph/KD. Setting aside Steph/KD, who have not finished their careers, every single one of these guys are top 15 all-time. Most lists have most of these guys as top 10. Without one of these generational superstars, it's a lot harder to win a title.

Let's take the NBA right now. In my opinion, the only players right now who can be the #1 on a championships team are (in no particular order):
LeBron James

Steph Curry

Kevin Durant (at least before his injury)

James Harden

Kawhi Leonard

Giannis Antetokounmpo 

That's just 6 guys. I don't think that guys like Westbrook or AD can be a #1 guy on a champion, and their previous playoffs history kind of proves that point. So when taking all this into account, is it really more valuable to be a top-15, All-star caliber player for 10-15 years, when that's never really enough to be contending for a ring without a better player backing you up? I'd argue that a short peak of just 3-5 years, where you're a top 5 player in the NBA and your team is in championship contention every year is much more valuable. 5 years of contention followed by 15 years of missing the playoffs is better than 15 years of second-round exits, IMO.

To me, this is the difference between baseball and basketball. In baseball, you don't need a top-5 or even top-10 player in the league to win the World Series. The playoffs are a crapshoot, and wildcard teams often advance quite far. Making the playoffs 10 times as a wildcard is probably going to get you more WS wins than 2 or 3 #1 seeds. On the other hand, basketball is far more influenced by individual greatness. Mike Trout can't do anything if his teammate strikes out or flubs a grounder, but LeBron can influence every part of the game. In basketball, you probably win more championships with 3 #1 seeded favorites than with 20 #6 seeded teams. Only two teams have won the championships seeded fourth or lower, and #1 seeds make up 75% of all championship victories.

Well, they are doing as good as before, maybe even better, and one of the biggest factors in their Defense has been Robert Covington.

But first, let's go back to the beginning of the career of Robert Covington.

## Early Days in the NBA

Covington went undrafted in the 2013 NBA draft, after which he played for Rockets in Summer League. They were pleased with him and signed him to an NBA contract. However, he spent most of his first NBA season in D-League (now G-League) playing for Rio Grande Valley Vipers.

He was named an All-Star that season and became MVP of the All-Star game, he continued with great performance through the rest of the season and won the Rookie of the Year award in D-League. Even then he displayed what he is best at, shooting and defending. Covington has averaged 23.2 PPG while shooting 37% for 3. Along with that, he averaged 9.2 rebounds and 2.4 steals and 1.4 blocks per game, proving already then that he is a complete defensive player.

## Heart of the Process

At the end of 2013-14 season, Covington signed a 4-year contract with Philadelphia 76ers. Immediately in his first season, he surged to the starting lineup. He maintained a pretty similar role as he had while he was at college and in G-League, playing as a Small Forward. In my opinion, he represents the heart of the 76ers' _Process_, an undrafted player who wasn't given a chance in other NBA teams but thanks to his constant hard work and playing hard in the D-League he proved himself as a serviceable NBA player.

He earned respect through seasons as one of the prime 3 and D players in the NBA. He was the ideal fit for Sixers' play style, as he could have spread the floor in the offense and cover anyone in the defense, taking on best opposing Guard or Forward. His defensive excellence was officially recognized in the 2017-18 season when he was named into the NBA's All-Defensive First Team.



This brings us to the [first chart](https://i.imgur.com/fXA46qR.png). This is RoCo's defensive chart, which shows the success of defending the opposing players based on the distance to the basket. He was mostly situated on the 3pt line, defending either three-pointers or long mid-range shots. He was defending the three-pointers quite good, a bit below the average NBA player. But it's worth mentioning that RoCo led the NBA that season in deflections per game, which shows his relentlessness on the defensive side.

## Move to the Timberwolves and injury struggles

But as the pedigree of the Sixers grew, there was, unfortunately, no place for Covington in already _Processed_ Sixers. He was shipped to Minnesota along with Šarić. He struggled in Minnesota, mainly with injuries. He sustained a knee injury and mentioned he was struggling to cope with that as that was the first big injury in his career. However, he managed to successfully jump back into the action this year posting up similar numbers as in the 2017-18 season. Which brings us to this year's trade deadline.

## Change of Style in Houston

As I was always saying, RoCo's primary position while in 76ers was Small Forward. That kind of already started to shift towards the Power Forward position in Timberwolves. Well with Rockets, Covington plays mostly C/PF position. And he adapted to it gracefully.

Since the trade to Houston Rockets, he is [3rd in total blocks](https://i.imgur.com/H8ZWJMs.png) with 35. He managed to get that number of blocks in 14 games which aren't a lot of games but that is still a significant sign of change in his position and style.

### Focusing on Paint Coverage

Once a top perimeter defender, Covington is now faced with a new role, as he or PJ Tucker are often guarding the centers. Also, they sometimes mix it up with a bit of a zone defense (Box and One, or a 3-2 zone) where again Covington and Tucker stay low. But as mentioned, Rockets most of the time play the usual man-to-man defense with one advantage over (most) other teams. They can switch ANYTHING. All of their guards are taller than average, so quite often Harden ends up in the middle of the paint guarding the opposing center, and the rest of the team swarm the center to put the pressure on.

The result of everything I said is that there is a big difference in the areas where Covington is defending the shots.

In [Minnesota](https://i.imgur.com/K1wT817.png), he spent most of the time on the perimeter, around 3 point line. He was as good defender in Minny as he was during his stint in Philly. However, his interior defense was rather lacking. That could be attributed to the overall bad defense that the Wolves had, but still, it is a pretty bad percentage.

Well, there is a big difference in the [Houston chart](https://i.imgur.com/ZWr7k8S.png) from the previous one. First of all, look at how much happier Robert is. Secondly, as I already mentioned he spends a lot more time in the post and defending centers, hence the number of defended shots around the basket is a lot higher. The number on the perimeter also increased, which can be attributed to the fact that Rockets switch almost everything so Covington often sticks to the offensive player until he shoots the triple. And while he regressed a bit at that distance, he is still a really good defender. That regression can be maybe tied with the fact than he can sometimes be a bit late to cover the three point shot when he plays on the low post in soft-zones which I mentioned before.

Nevertheless, the really good defensive efficiency close to the basket, for a 6 ft 7 forward, is a huge improvement for him, as well as the Rockets' team as a whole.

### Hustle remains, but in a different way

Covington is known for his high work rate on the defensive side. That usually manifested in a high number of deflections, which would lead to a steal either by him, or his teammate, or it would just generally disrupt the offensive flow.

However, with his move to the Rockets, that changed a bit. His number of deflections took a bit of a hit but remains high, but the positive news is that the number of contested shots, especially 2 point shots, increased significantly.

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/pmNXTKM.png) you can see how he moved from the middle of the pack in Contested shots, towards the top of the pack.

This amount of contested shots per game, during his 14 game stint with Rockets, is also the [highest of his career, by far](https://i.imgur.com/pdMntSv.png).

I mentioned in the introduction chapter that Covington led the league in deflections when he was selected for the NBA All-Defensive team. Well, he lead the league season before that as well. His 2018-19 season was shortened by the knee injury, and his number did take a bit of a hit, but they were still pretty elite. Numbers kept decreasing in all categories this season before the trade, after which the number of contested shots skyrocketed.

### Impact on the Team

His impact can be seen by looking at the advanced ratings, which calculate the number of points produced per 100 possessions (offensive rating) and points allowed per 100 possessions (defensive rating). While he generally doesn't add anything special on the offensive side (I'll touch on that later), he boosts the Rockets [significantly on the defensive side](https://i.imgur.com/mfTNhDi.png).

When he is on the court, the Rockets have a better (smaller) defensive rating by 6.3 points per 100 possessions. That is a really big boost. However, as with all other stats and charts I plotted, it's just on a 14 game sample. But if anything, it's a positive sign that Rockets pulled of a good trade.

## Offensive game

Even though this is mostly a look at Covington's defensive side of the game, I'll quickly touch on his offensive adjustment, well actually, he didn't have to adjust much, as he was already playing in a Moreyball mindset.

His [shot chart from Minnesota](https://i.imgur.com/BJkWhHB.png) did, however, have several mid-range jumpers.

But with the move to Houston, coach D'Antoni and the [staff corrected that](https://i.imgur.com/RfGMuL7.png), now he shoots it only from three-point range or paint. I'm not sure how he allowed himself to shot that single mid-range shot though.

Generally, the volume of three-pointers increased in Houston, he shots 1.5 more three-pointers per game than in Minnesota, with even better efficiency. He was already pretty much a Catch and Shoot type of player as he had 82% of shots assisted in Minny. That number jumped to 94% in Houston. But generally, we can agree that his offensive game fits the Rockets perfectly.

## Conclusion

Covington returned to the Rockets' team almost 6 years after they gave him his first NBA contract. Who knows how his career would have developed had they decided to keep him. He would have fitted in perfectly in Houston's system all these years. A great wing defender, who is capable of defending big men AND switching onto faster guards. And to complete the package he shoots the three-pointer solidly.

Even if this *micro Ball* experiment doesn't turn out great in the end, it is one of the more interesting things to watch develop by the end of the season. And given that the post game is in the slow process of dying, maybe Rockets will turn out to be the crazy and misunderstood *geniuses* and come out on top?",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,80882,public,self,Robert Covington's seamless adaptation to Houston Rockets' Defensive Scheme,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/fu6ndl/robert_covingtons_seamless_adaptation_to_houston/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Down below are his opponents records compared to LeBron James and Michael Jordan. As you could see, Bryant has the edge. Also, Bryant has also faced a team under 45 wins only once.

For the sake of context, I didn't add any of their opponent's projected records that were affected due to the lockout seasons. To me, if it didn't happen then I shouldn't list it as they are a ton of unknown variables that could've been a factor in their records such as late season slumps or injuries. 

This is factoring in finals opponents as well.

#Playoff opponents faced

Player | 60+ win teams | 50-59 win teams | 42-49 win teams | 41-win teams or lower
---------|----------|----------|----------|---------
Bryant | 7 | 25 | 7 | 0
James | 8 | 15 | 11 | 7
Jordan | 9 | 20 | 5 | 3

As you could see, Bryant has the edge followed by Jordan then James. The late 1990's and the entirety of the 2000's Western conference is, in my opinion, the toughest and most competitive era of basketball ever. 

Coupled with the fact that the pace was excruciatingly slow and the defense was arguably the best in NBA history, it goes to show what Bryant had to overcome. 

#Playoff opponent accolades

Player | MVP | All-NBA 1st-Team | All-NBA 2nd-Team | All-NBA 3rd-Team | All-Star
---------|----------|----------|----------|---------|---------
Bryant | 5 | 20 | 13 | 11 | 55
James | 3 | 9 | 13 | 17 | 73
Jordan | 3 | 14 | 9 | 9 | 54

Once again, Bryant has edge in his opponent's talent and accolades followed by Jordan then James. James does have the edge in All-Star players faced but in my opinion, making an All-NBA team is much more meaningful and impactful than making an All-Star team. 

And due to how deep and talented the 2000's were, there were a lot of very talented players who simply didn't make an All-NBA team or even qualify for the All-Star game.

1. Set a filter for the team (hou), then a filter for Westbrook, and another filter excluding Harden. 

2. After that I would copy paste the data into excel (it actually transferred pretty well)

3. Made a total of all minutes for all lineups  

4. Made a ratio of each lineup based on how many minutes it played vs total of all minutes for all line ups 

5. Multiplied the net rating of each line up by its ratio

6.  Ran a sum of all all the weighted net ratings for a total on the season. 

This process actually didn't take long (maybe 5 minutes or so) but it didn't get me the same numbers that Lowe had. Any ideas of an easier way to find or calculate this data more accurately?

Ones that played at All-Star levels.

Joe Johnson - Put up numbers with the Hawks for years and even when he started to slow down showed how well he could still play on a veteran stacked Nets team. Constantly making clutch shots.

Chris Bosh - He always played at a high level since the beginning of his career but got overshadowed on the Heat. Once Wade and LeBron dipped I think NBA fans were excited to see what he could do but his health cut his career short in what was still near his peak.

Deron Williams - A legit superstar when he was in his prime and arguments were often made of who was the best point guard between him and Chris Paul. I had D-Will's shoes and was my favorite PG at the time. 

Tony Parker - Close to the cutoff of last ten years but he was part of the Spurs big three. He'll be the most underrated in my opinion as obviously there's Tim Duncan but Ginobili had a ridiculous international career and was a pioneer in the Euro-step.

LaMarcus - Solid player for many years and put up great numbers. His post game is still amazing to watch and never felt like a negative.

Rudy Gay - Also put up great numbers and ""NO NOT THIS GUY!"" type of player. Has a history of teams getting better after he's traded which I still don't understand. Ball hog? Bad defense? Stat-sheet stuffer? I know I would have loved to have him on my team in his prime.

Stoudemire - Yes, he had those amazing years with Nash but they never won anything. His chance for primetime action was with the Knicks but got cut short due to injuries. He's one the biggest players I think about how well he'd do in this era. Quick on his feet and had a deadly midrange game.

Paul Millsap - More all around and... actually, should he even be on this list? Solid not great.

Pau Gasol - Phenomenal passer for his position and could always count on the guy. Had back-to-back championships with the Lakers but even then he wasn't recognized. He was a scapegoat regularly as most of the praise went to Kobe (still can't believe...)

Marc Gasol - Might be the best example of this post. He just popped OFF in the middle of 2010s and had a legitimate case for MVP during the '16-'17 season. Has come down since but still someone you'd love to have.

Rondo - Rondo.

Before I'm accused of being redundant, which, admittedly, is partially true, I'd like to point out that this team is specific to the 21st century. This post is inspired by a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l7j4Jp9dM0) from the Ringer by Bill Simmons on his ""21st Century Wine-Bottle Team"". The basic concept is that you take a player's version of themselves over the 21st century by their respective year, and assemble those players into the best possible team. In this hypothetical scenario, this team is facing aliens trying to challenge the best basketball players ever. A little bit of a silly premise, sure, but fun nonetheless. He did try to account for team chemistry within his team, so choices like Klay Thompson and Ray Allen, while they may not be the most talented, are easy plug and play guys. Here are Bill Simmons' choices:

Player Positions | Bill Simmons' 21st Century Wine Bottle Team
---------|---------
Starting PG | '16 Stephen Curry
Starting SG | '06 Kobe Bryant
Starting SF | '13 LeBron James
Starting PF | '17 Kevin Durant
Starting C | '03 Tim Duncan
Backup G | '14 Chris Paul
Backup G | '01 Ray Allen
Backup F | '17 Kawhi Leonard
Backup F | '04 Kevin Garnett
Backup C | '18 Anthony Davis
11th man | '16 Klay Thompson
12th man | '01 Shaquille O'Neal
Head Coach | Gregg Popovich
Assistant Coach | Brad Stevens

I don't fully agree with Simmons, so I've included my own rendition of his team, plus a couple of other extra teams I'd like to see face off against each other. The ""A"" Team is supposed to be the best possible team I could create, while still keeping the team cohesive. The ""B"" team uses a very similar concept, except for the fact that none of the players from the ""A"" team can be used again. The ""Olympics"" team is the best conglomeration of chemistry possible that would potentially beat a potentially more team---think the 2004 Olympics with Manu Ginobili &amp; co. versus the USA Team. Finally, the 20th Century wine bottle team should be relatively self-explanatory. We're going to assume that the games will be officiated like the NBA in 2005, where hand-checking is not allowed,  zone defense is legal, there is a 3 point line, and the players are still allowed to maintain being physical.

Player Positions | My 21st Century ""A"" Team | My 21st Century ""B"" Team | My 20th Century Team
---------|---------|----------|----------
Starting PG | '13 LeBron James | '07 Steve Nash | '87 Magic Johnson

Head Coach | Phil Jackson | Phil Jackson | Phil Jackson
Assistant Coach | Gregg Popovich | Gregg Popovich | Pat Riley

Some of the rationale behind my choices:

* For my 21st Century Wine Bottle ""A"" Team: I think what's easily the most egregious choice in most eyes would be putting in '16 Leonard. I think, when it comes to fit, '16 Kawhi Leonard is basically a role-player god. His usage rate was significantly lower this season and his catch and shoot percentage was much higher this season compared to following seasons. He was hyper-efficient from the field, shooting 44% from 3. I don't even have to mention his all-time perimeter defense. I understand '17 Leonard is a better player, but this version of him would be best for the team due to his smaller role. As for any other controversial picks---I think having '03 Duncan over Shaq may pester some and having '08 Kobe instead of '06 Kobe might bother some, too. For Shaq vs. Duncan, it comes down to possessions and defense. I think '00 Shaq may stagnate the offense and create potential issues with possessions (there's only 1 ball to go around), so I have him as a bench piece to wreak havoc in limited minutes. Duncan is there to provide top notch defense, basketball IQ, and leadership. Tim Duncan, even though he got a lot of possessions this season, would still be more than willing to play a reduced role, I'm sure. ‘08 Kobe is his most underrated season and best season simultaneously, which is kind of weird to consider. I don’t want to get too much into hypotheticals, but just imagine if Bynum was healthy during those Finals---I’m sure we’d be talking about that season much different. This wasn’t Kobe at his scoring peak, but this was him at the top of his game defensively, playmaking wise, leadership wise, and “winning” wise. His work in the first half of the 2008 season before Pau Gasol came, his series against the Spurs (insanely, insanely underrated), and his leadership in the 2008 Olympics made this a phenomenal time in Kobe’s career. Curry is self-explanatory---the spacing and off-ball movement commotion he provides is invaluable. For LeBron, I considered doing ""maestro"" LeBron (aka his '18 season), but I decided instead to get a guy with 80% of '18 LeBron's smarts, but with 130% of his athleticism and 200% of his defense in 2013 LeBron.

* For my 21st Century Wine Bottle ""B"" Team: I feel like most of my picks here are non-controversial. Maybe the exclusion of Allen Iverson might irk some, but I think Harden is better. Steve Nash has a pick and roll option with Howard (rip 2013 Lakers), or a pick and pop option with Dirk. Stojakovic is the easiest fit of all time on any NBA team outside of Klay Thompson. Tracy McGrady is there because of his playmaking, ability to defend the best wing player, and unstoppable scoring. 

* For my 20th Century Wine Bottle Team: Bill Walton's probably the controversial pick here. The omission of Charles Barkley, too, maybe, but Julius Erving was an absolute monster through the regular season AND playoffs that year, so it's fine with me. So, the reason I want Walton over Wilt, even when Wilt was more unselfish in '67, is that Walton provides a unique matchup problem on my team. His playmaking ability scrambles the opposing defenses and opens up a new dimension of high post passing that would've otherwise been unavailable otherwise.

Before I'm accused of being redundant, which, admittedly, is partially true, I'd like to point out that this team is specific to the 21st century. This post is inspired by a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l7j4Jp9dM0) from the Ringer by Bill Simmons on his ""21st Century Wine-Bottle Team"". The basic concept is that you take a player's version of themselves over the 21st century by their respective year, and assemble those players into the best possible team. In this hypothetical scenario, this team is facing aliens trying to challenge the best basketball players ever. A little bit of a silly premise, sure, but fun nonetheless. He did try to account for team chemistry within his team, so choices like Klay Thompson and Ray Allen, while they may not be the most talented, are easy plug and play guys. Here are Bill Simmons' choices:

Player Positions | Bill Simmons' 21st Century Wine Bottle Team
---------|---------
Starting PG | '16 Stephen Curry
Starting SG | '06 Kobe Bryant
Starting SF | '13 LeBron James
Starting PF | '17 Kevin Durant
Starting C | '03 Tim Duncan
Backup G | '14 Chris Paul
Backup G | '01 Ray Allen
Backup F | '17 Kawhi Leonard
Backup F | '04 Kevin Garnett
Backup C | '18 Anthony Davis
11th man | '16 Klay Thompson
12th man | '01 Shaquille O'Neal
Head Coach | Gregg Popovich
Assistant Coach | Brad Stevens

I don't fully agree with Simmons, so I've included my own rendition of his team, plus a couple of other extra teams I'd like to see face off against each other. The ""A"" Team is supposed to be the best possible team I could create, while still keeping the team cohesive. The ""B"" team uses a very similar concept, except for the fact that none of the players from the ""A"" team can be used again. The ""Olympics"" team is the best conglomeration of chemistry possible that would potentially beat a potentially more team---think the 2004 Olympics with Manu Ginobili &amp; co. versus the USA Team. Finally, the 20th Century wine bottle team should be relatively self-explanatory. We're going to assume that the games will be officiated like the NBA in 2005, where hand-checking is not allowed,  zone defense is legal, there is a 3 point line, and the players are still allowed to maintain being physical.

Player Positions | My 21st Century ""A"" Team | My 21st Century ""B"" Team My 20th Century Team
---------|---------|----------|----------
Starting PG | '13 LeBron James | '07 Steve Nash | '87 Magic Johnson
Starting SG | '16 Stephen Curry | '03 Tracy McGrady | '93 Michael Jordan
Starting SF | '16 Kawhi Leonard | '04 Peja Stojakovic | '86 Larry Bird
Starting PF | '17 Kevin Durant | '11 Dirk Nowitzki | '98 Karl Malone
Starting C | '03 Tim Duncan | '11 Dwight Howard | '72 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
Backup G | '09 Dwyane Wade | '03 Jason Kidd | '63 Oscar Robertson
Backup G | '08 Kobe Bryant | '19 Klay Thompson | '95 Reggie Miller
Backup F | '20 Giannis Antetokounmpo | '00 Grant Hill | '76 Julius Erving
Backup F | '04 Kevin Garnett | '02 Paul Pierce | '94 Scottie Pippen
Backup C | '00 Shaquille O'Neal | '18 Anthony Davis | '94 Hakeem Olajuwon
11th man | '09 Chris Paul | '18 James Harden | '62 Bill Russell
12th man | '01 Ray Allen | '02 Chris Webber | '77 Bill Walton
Head Coach | Phil Jackson | Phil Jackson | Phil Jackson
Assistant Coach | Gregg Popovich | Gregg Popovich | Pat Riley

Some of the rationale behind my choices:

* For my 21st Century Wine Bottle ""A"" Team: I think what's easily the most egregious choice in most eyes would be putting in '16 Leonard. I think, when it comes to fit, '16 Kawhi Leonard is basically a role-player god. His usage rate was significantly lower this season and his catch and shoot percentage was much higher this season compared to following seasons. He was hyper-efficient from the field, shooting 44% from 3. I don't even have to mention his all-time perimeter defense. I understand '17 Leonard is a better player, but this version of him would be best for the team due to his smaller role. As for any other controversial picks---I think having '03 Duncan over Shaq may pester some and having '08 Kobe instead of '06 Kobe might bother some, too. For Shaq vs. Duncan, it comes down to possessions and defense. I think '00 Shaq may stagnate the offense and create potential issues with possessions (there's only 1 ball to go around), so I have him as a bench piece to wreak havoc in limited minutes. Duncan is there to provide top notch defense, basketball IQ, and leadership. Tim Duncan, even though he got a lot of possessions this season, would still be more than willing to play a reduced role, I'm sure. ‘08 Kobe is his most underrated season and best season simultaneously, which is kind of weird to consider. I don’t want to get too much into hypotheticals, but just imagine if Bynum was healthy during those Finals---I’m sure we’d be talking about that season much different. This wasn’t Kobe at his scoring peak, but this was him at the top of his game defensively, playmaking wise, leadership wise, and “winning” wise. His work in the first half of the 2008 season before Pau Gasol came, his series against the Spurs (insanely, insanely underrated), and his leadership in the 2008 Olympics made this a phenomenal time in Kobe’s career. Curry is self-explanatory---the spacing and off-ball movement commotion he provides is invaluable. For LeBron, I considered doing ""maestro"" LeBron (aka his '18 season), but I decided instead to get a guy with 80% of '18 LeBron's smarts, but with 130% of his athleticism and 200% of his defense in 2013 LeBron.

* For my 21st Century Wine Bottle ""B"" Team: I feel like most of my picks here are non-controversial. Maybe the exclusion of Allen Iverson might irk some, but I think Harden is better. Steve Nash has a pick and roll option with Howard (rip 2013 Lakers), or a pick and pop option with Dirk. Stojakovic is the easiest fit of all time on any NBA team outside of Klay Thompson. Tracy McGrady is there because of his playmaking, ability to defend the best wing player, and unstoppable scoring. 

* For my 20th Century Wine Bottle Team: Bill Walton's probably the controversial pick here. The omission of Charles Barkley, too, maybe, but Julius Erving was an absolute monster through the regular season AND playoffs that year, so it's fine with me. So, the reason I want Walton over Wilt, even when Wilt was more unselfish in '67, is that Walton provides a unique matchup problem on my team. His playmaking ability scrambles the opposing defenses and opens up a new dimension of high post passing that would've otherwise been unavailable otherwise.

It is the story of how a coin flip and a forgotten check released the ultimate butterfly effect onto the NBA forever.

There will be a TLDR at the bottom and I will post a video essay version for visuals at the bottom, if anyone is interested in either.

Let's go back to 1969, big things were happening. The Celtics had just come off of their 11th championship in 12 years, The ABA was just beginning to find some ground, and America was getting ready to land on the moon for the first time in history.

While that was happening, something big was also happening in California- more specifically, UCLA. By ""big"" I mean 7 feet 2 inches, 225 LBS: Kareem Abdul Jabber.

In his freshman year he lead the bruins to a 33-0 record averaging 29 PPG on 67% shooting and won a national title, again, as a freshman! To give context to how dominant Kareem was, in his sophomore year, the NCAA banned dunking from college basketball, and a large part of that was because of Kareem. At this point in his basketball career believe it or not, he was pretty offensively limited, but it didn't matter. Anytime Kareem was within 4 feet of the basket it would be an instant dunk, offensive rebounds were easily 2 points, there was no one big or strong enough to think about altering anything Kareem did

[While the NCAA provided other reasons for the ban, like it being too damaging to back boards, It is widely accepted that Kareem played a big part in the ban.](https://youtu.be/Dt4UducROR4?t=103)

Unsurprisingly, his points per game did drop, but it did help Kareem develop his footwork and the shot he would become famous for- his sky-hook. So ultimately, this ban would help Kareem become the Kareem we know him as today: One of the most offensively polished centers in NBA history .He ended his college career with 3 national titles and 26 points per game at UCLA.

Now... this is where it gets really interesting.

At the end of the 1968 NBA season, we have 2 teams contending for the number one pick: The Milwaukee Bucks and Phoenix Suns who were 2 expansion teams coming off of their first season in the NBA Up until the 1984 season, the number 1 pick was determined by a coin flip between the 2 teams with the worst record in each conference, and it was obvious who either would pick number 1. The suns asked to choose and the Bucks and Commissioner agreed The Sun's owner Jerry Colangelo wanted to get the fans involved with the pick. So they did a poll in the newspaper and according to Jerry 51.2% of the fans voted to pick heads.

&gt;“I wanted our fans to share in the win or the loss,” Colangelo says. “It was such a monumental, once-in-a-lifetime flip of a coin, why not let your fans be a part of that?”

The story continues as this:

From his office in New York, the commissioner of the NBA, James Kennedy, dialed up the 2 owners of the Bucks and Suns. They were both in their respective cities and the commissioner's office was in New York, so it was done via telephone.

&gt;""Gentlemen, Kennedy began, ""I am going to put the receiver on my desk."" ""Then I will flip this coin in the air and catch it with my right hand and put it on the back with my left.""

The suns had previously asked to choose first to which the Bucks and Commissioner agreed they stuck with heads. Kennedy laid down the telephone, did exactly what he said he was going to do he flips it, it lands heads initially but he flips it over like he previously said he would, [and it is tails.](https://youtu.be/72d3762ro_w?t=63) The Bucks win the first pick of the 1969 NBA Draft.

Also after they won, the owner of the bucks grabbed the general manager so hard and hugged him that he jammed a lit cigarette into his ear. Jerry Colangelo also says he drove around town for hours trying to get himself together, it was absolutely devastating for the Sun's front office

**Sidenote:** The Bucks after selecting Kareem, went on to Draft Bob Dandridge in the 4th round with the 45th pick who would easily become the second best player inthe draft with his versatility scoring wise and also helped the Bucks improve along with Kareem and Oscar later.

**So there was a 50/50 Chance Kareem was a member of the Phoenix suns and Bucks, let's take a moment to think about that.**

While the Phoenix suns roster wasn't anything special given their position, They did have 2 20 point per game scorers in Gail Goodrich and Dick Van Arsdale.

The next year they bring back those scorers, and obtain the rights to Connie Hawkins via a con flip between them and the Seattle SuperSonics, the 2nd and 3rd worst teams in the league did that as a consolation prize that year. This is not something that was standard, Connie Hawkins is a very unique situation which is too complex to explain in a short paragraph. To sum up, he was coming off of a wrongly issued ban from the NBA, and I assume that was the easiest way to get him into the league.

They improved from 16 wins to 39 wins with the Hawk pouring in almost 25 points a game along with Goodrich and Arsdale still scoring, but imagine replacing Connie Hawkins with the most dominant big man the NBA had ever seen at that time (they wouldn't have Connie Hawkins because it was consolation). Instead Goodrich is traded to the L.A Lakers and the sun's continue developing their young players and actually have some winning seasons. But what could have been with a different dominant big man guard combo with Goodrich and Kareem, the suns were a 50/50 coin flip away fromfinding out and being looked back as a respectable and dominant team in history. If they win that coin flip, Phoenix would most likely at least pick up 1 championship and Oscar Robertson would never have a title, thus changing his modern perception of kids who google ""Oscar Robertson Stats"" and move on.

The Bucks then select Kareem with the 1st of pick of the NBA draft, and so do the New York Nets with the 1st pick of the ABA draft

Kareem was raised in New York and attended college in California; he hated the idea of moving to the Midwest. He later wrote ""They were glad to have me in Milwaukee. but i wasn't the happiest guy in the world to be there.""According to Kareem, Milwaukee looked like ""a whole lot of red-necked farmers getting drunk.""

Also, At this point the Kareem has been approached by another organization: The Harlem Globetrotters He was first offered 1 million dollars to play for the Harlem Globetrotters- which he declined, so this leaves 2 organizations - the NBA and ABA. According to Kareem's autobiography ""Giant Steps"" he wanted to play in the ABA for the nets, he grew up in new York and wanted to play near his family, along with the city's high Muslim population and he always was interested in being in a big market, hence him forcing a trade to the L.A Lakers later.

Still, both leagues needed him when I say both leagues needed him, I mean they NEEDED him, and they needed him to not be in their respective opposite leagues. For the NBA he was going to be next big star since Oscar Robertson and help the NBA's attendance problem, and if the ABA got him that early in their existence then it would have shown their league means business and even gotten a TV contract, which they never did, or it could have forced the NBA/ABA merger to happen even earlier, changing a lot of things in the NBA.

So both organizations got into a massive bidding war for Kareem's salary, which usually, would flatter anyone. But Kareem didn't like it. So he tells them he will hear their best possible offer from both sides and that is it. The ABA chooses their commissioner, George Mikan, to represent them and pitch their deal. Mikan said:

&gt;""If he wants to play in Oshkosh or the moon, or anywhere between, we'll establish franchises there,"" he boasted. ""We want Lew and we'll give him anything he wants.""

The ABA's plan was to give him a check for 1 million straight up to show how serious they were, and discuss his actual salary from there. Also an even better unrelated George Mikan quote:

&gt;""People will stand and cheer when they see our balls""

In reference to the red and white ABA ball, thank you George.

The NBA (Bucks front office) meets with him first. This part is all according to the Bucks General Manager John Erickson

&gt;We were in New York for what I thought was a get-acquainted session,"" Erickson recalled. ""(Alcindor) and his agent, Sam Gilbert, walked into the hotel room and asked us for an offer.""Well, we didn't have an offer. But I noticed that Lew appeared hungry, so I said, 'We've got a plan in mind, but we'd like a little time to work it into a firm offer.""""Let's go have lunch. Then, give us a couple of hours, come back and we'll present it to you.""""Lew thought that was a good idea. He wanted to do some shopping anyway, so it was agreed that they'd come back at 2 o'clock.""

While that happened, The Bucks team scrambled together an offer which was a guaranteed package of 1 to 5 years on his contract, and a salary of 1.5 million dollars which at that time, was ground breaking considering the Bucks payed 2 million dollars just to enter the league as an expansion team.

&gt;""Lew liked that because it gave him some options,"" Erickson said. ""He wasn't sure that he wanted to play in Milwaukee. He'd said that he preferred to play in Los Angeles or New York.

Before we look at the final decision and why, let's go to the ABA's offer.

George Mikan meets with Kareem and his agent second. He has the check. They talk about numbers, about bringing in some of his old UCLA teammates and letting them play in New York, and while this all happens, **George Mikan** **never gives him the check. He forgets the check for 1 million dollars.** Along with this apparently they low balled the hell out of Kareem and his team leaves the meeting feeling insulted.

the Hell out of Kareem and his team leaves the meeting feeling insulted.In an interview with Sports illustrated a few months later, he revealed that:

&gt;""The ABA had the inside track on me, but they had blown it""

After he felt he had heard both of the best offers, Kareem signed with the Bucks for 1.5 million 5 years. George Mikan quickly tried to run in with a 3 plus million dollar offer but Kareem is true to his word, and the rest is history. If Kareem had gone to the ABA, if George Mikan hadn't FORGOTTEN A 1 MILLION DOLLAR CHECK, Then like before, Oscar never gets a championship, and the '71 '72 and '74 at-least MVPs are different players and our modern perceptions on historic players today changes a whole lot. Kareem dominates the ABA instead of the NBA until the merger, thus heavily reducing his NBA resume and bringing him way down on people's ""all-time"" list.

The bucks go from 27 wins to 56, a 29 game improvement, and they win a championship in just their second year of having Kareem. He racks up 3 MVPs while on the Bucks and dominates the entire league. Although he later forces his way out to L.A, **That coin flip and that forgotten check from George Mikan changed everything forever.**

TLDR: The draft lottery until 1984 was determined by a coin flip and in 1969 the Phoenix Suns almost got Kareem. The NBA and ABA get into a massive bidding war over Kareem, but the ABA blows it and Kareem signs with the NBA

Kevin Johnson was drafted with the 7th pick in the 1987 NBA Draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers. He played 52 games in Cleveland averaging 7.3 ppg and 3.7 apg, backing up Cavalier great Mark Price. On February 28, 1988 Cleveland traded Kevin Johnson, Mark West, Tyrone Corbin, and a pick for Larry Nance, Mike Sanders, and a pick. Now out of Mark Price’s shadow, it was Kevin Johnson’s time to shine. He finished out his rookie season starting 25 of 28 games for Phoenix and averaging 12.6 ppg, 8.7 apg, and 1.5 spg. Now began the birth of his amazingly underrated career.

Kevin Johnson went on to become the 1988-89 Most Improved Player after his stats jumped to 20.4 ppg, 12.2 apg, and 1.7 spg. With the exception of his atrocious three-point shooting, he was everything you could ever want in a Point Guard. Somehow he didn’t make the All-Star game this season. Even more unbelievable is the fact that he didn’t even place Top-10 in Western Conference Guards voting! As his career progressed his numbers stayed relatively the same for around 9 seasons with his scoring numbers staying around 20 with the exception of two seasons in which he averaged 15.5 ppg and 16.1 ppg. His assist numbers were also near 10 apg yearly. With the help of Tom Chambers and Charles Barkley he was able to help lead Phoenix to the Western Conference Finals multiple times and even caught a date with “His Airness” himself in the Finals. Kevin Johnson finished his career with 1x MIP Award, 3x All-Star, and despite only 3 All-Star Appearances, 5x All-NBA.

One last thing I’d like to point out is that Kevin Johnson’s prime numbers were better than Steve Nash’s MVP numbers. In the 2004-05 Season, Steve Nash won his first MVP averaging 15.5 ppg, 11.5 apg, and 1.8 spg on great shooting numbers while leading Phoenix to a 62-20 record and they eventually lost to Tim Duncan’s Spurs in the Western Conference Finals. The following season he won his second MVP averaging 18.8 ppg, 10.5 apg, and 1.5 spg also on great shooting numbers. This season Phoenix finished 54-28 and lost to Dirk Nowitzki’s Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals. Kevin Johnson in his prime averaged 22.5 ppg, 11.4 apg, and 1.3 spg while leading the Suns to a 54-28 record that led to a loss against the Trail-Blazers in the Western Conference Finals and the next season he followed it up with 22.1 ppg, 10.1 apg, and 2.1 spg while leading Phoenix to a 55-27 record. I’m mot trying to discredit Steve Nash at all because he is one of the best point guards of all-time, but god damn Kevin Johnson was near Steve Nash’s level statwise. I’d argue that if Kevin Johnson was in Steve Nash’s position he’d have both of those MVP’s, but instead he’s fading into irrelevancy if he hasn’t already. Seriously, when was the last time you or you heard someone talking about Kevin Johnson.

Fun Fact: Kevin Johnson was also the 55th mayor of Sacramento from 2008-2016",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,80678,public,self,The Criminally Underrated Career of Kevin Johnson,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/fthkk5/the_criminally_underrated_career_of_kevin_johnson/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the sake of this post l, I'd like to look past that and discuss a different aspect to both of them - their predocessors who paved the way.

Today, LeBron is often compared to past NBA legends like Magic Johnson and Oscar Robertson, because of them all being high-scoring playmakers in power forwards' frames, who could rebound well too. This leads me to ask:

Who can Michael Jordan compared to that came before him, or who was mentioned as having set his precedent?  I.e., explosive, dominant scorers with world-class defense?  Also, around his size (think guard to small forward frame - he was a lean 6'6"".

Kobe is the closest comparison post-MJ, but came into the league a full 12 years after Jordan was drafted.

I've heard Jordan mention he was inspired by Jerry West, and having memories 80's basketball myself, I think Julius Erving was a player he was compared to a lot in the beginning too, as both were high-flying dunkers who thrived in the paint, both faces of the league too.

Were there any players before Mike who he resembled, who had a similar game and frame, defense and offense?

I get that they are desperate and throw stuff out there to generate any kind of reaction but I started to wonder if there are any fans out there who consider any of this to be a good idea.

I love basketball. It is by far my favorite sport. My second favorite (which is probably football) is a distant second. I'll watch that Wednesday game in early November that nobody cares about. I can spend a full day at a park watching pick up games and be fully entertained the entire time.

I get hyped for the pre-season in September. The season starting in October is like a drink of water after doing 3 hours of non-stop yard work. The thought of shortening the season even the slightest is blasphemous.  I've heard the pro-arguments for it and while there are some valid points, none of it trumps watching a full 82 game season.

Harden is unlucky to have run into the generational greatness of the Warriors. The Suns could have won if not for the Spurs(or better refs). Malone just couldn\'t match MJ. And on and on we go, with the implication being that teams like the Suns or today\'s Rockets(jury is still out on them) are champion-caliber teams unlucky to run into better teams. The implicit assumption is that in another era, another time, these teams would have faced softer opposition and won a couple rings. Is that true however, or are dynasties just part and parcel of the NBA due to the oversized impact one dominant player can have on a team?\n\nIn order to analyze this, I took a look at every single NBA champion since the NBA-ABA merger(1976-1977). There have been 43 NBA champions since them. How many of these champions have been dynasties, how many had to beat a dynasty to win the ultimate prize, and how many ""lucked out"" and won a title without facing off against a dynasty? \n\nFirst, we have to define what a dynasty is. I\'m choosing to have a much looser definition of a dynasty: in my opinion, any team structured around a dominant talent(think top 10-15 all time) who wins 3 championships and makes 5 NBA finals is a dynasty. There might be dramatic change in the team, but as long as the star player stays on and they stay competitive, they remain a dynasty.\n\nSo, which teams fulfill those criteria? They are:\n\n1979-1989 Kareem/Magic Lakers: 5 championships, 8 Finals Appearances\n\n1978-1988 Bird Celtics: 3 championships, 5 Finals Appearances\n\n1988-1998 Jordan Bulls: 6 championships, 6 Finals Appearances\n\n1998-2014 Duncan Spurs: 5 championships, 6 Finals Appearances\n\n2000-2010 Kobe Lakers: 5 championships, 7 Finals Appearances\n\n2011-2018 Lebron Cavs/Heat: 3 championships, 8 Finals Appearances\n\n2014-2020 Steph Warriors: 3 championships, 5 Finals Appearances\n\nThese 7 teams, all with at least 3 championships/5 Finals Appearances have dominated the NBA post-merger, winning 30 of the 43 total titles. Who were the other 13 teams, and how did they do it?\n\n1976-1977 Trail Blazers: beat the #1 seed Kareem Lakers in the WCF\n\n1977-1978 Bullets: were lucky enough to avoid playing any dynasties\n\n1978-1979 Supersonics: beat the Kareem Lakers\n\n1982-1983 76ers: beat the Showtime Lakers\n\n1988-1989 Pistons: beat the Showtime Lakers and the MJ Bulls\n\n1989-1990 Pistons: beat the MJ bulls\n\n1993-1994 Rockets: MJ playing baseball\n\n1994-1995 Rockets: MJ playing baseball (and also beat the #1 seeded Spurs)\n\n2003-2004 Pistons: beat the Kobe Lakers\n\n2005-2006 Heat: no dynasties\n\n2007-2008 Celtics: beat the Kobe/Gasol Lakers\n\n2010-2011 Mavericks: beat the Big Three Heat\n\n2018-2019 Raptors: beat the KD Warriors\n\nOut of these 13 teams, 7 of them unquestionably had to go through a dynasty to win: the 1983 76ers, 1989-1990 Pistons, 2004 Pistons, 2008 Celtics, 2011 Mavericks, and the 2019 Raptors.\n\n3 of these teams played a dynasty before it really hit its prime: the 1977 Trail Blazers and 1979 Supersonics played the Lakers pre-Magic, while the 1995 Rockets played the Spurs pre-Duncan. Despite this, the 1977 Lakers and 1995 Spurs were genuine powerhouses, with both teams picking up the #1 seed while their superstar won MVP.\n\nOnly 3 teams were lucky enough to not have any dynasty-level competition in their road to a title: the 1978 Bullets, the 1994 Rockets, and the 2006 Heat. Perhaps we can add the 1979 Sonics to that list as well. However, the point remains that winning a title while not having to take down a dynasty-level team is very rare.\n\nTake a look through any top 10 ranking(Bill Simmons for example), and you\'ll see how the top 10 were almost universally part of dynasties stomping out the hopes of slightly lesser players.\n\nMichael Jordan: leader of the Bulls Dynasty\n\nRussell: leader of the pre-merger Celtics Dynasty\n\nKareem: co-leader of the Showtime Lakers\n\nMagic: co-leader of the Showtime Lakers\n\nLarry: leader of yet another Celtics Dynasty\n\nWilt: won 2 rings and made it to 6 finals\n\nDuncan: leader of the Spurs dynasty\n\nKobe: leader/co-leader of the Lakers Dynasty\n\nThis ranking was published in 2010, so you can slot in LeBron at #2/#3 as another dynasty leader. That\'s just the hard truth of trying to win an NBA championship without a top 10 player of all time - think it\'s unfair that you have to go up against the MJ Bulls or the Steph/KD Warriors? Well if you insist you can face the Showtime Lakers instead, or the Bird Celtics, or the Kobe/Shaq Lakers, or LeBron, or Russell\'s Celtics. \n\nThe 1970s had parity: with 8 different champions in the decade. Ironically, the closest we\'ve come to that have been this past decade, though this ""parity"" consists of Kobe and Duncan winning another title each, LeBron winning on two different teams, Steph spearheading a Warriors dynasty, while the Mavs and Raptors were the only two teams to break through. Not much parity even with the plethora of champions.\n\nTLDR: Post merger, it\'s been almost impossible to win an NBA title without facing off against a top-10 player spearheading a dynasty team. While the Rockets may feel hard done by, their plight is the same of every top-tier team in decades past who just couldn\'t crack the champions.

This is the inside story of how Warriors forward Draymond Green is the player to lead the Warriors to a dynasty -- or the man who could stand in their way.

Editor's note: This story on Draymond Green was originally published on Oct. 19, 2016 and contains explicit language. Watch Game 5 of the 2016 NBA Finals on Wednesday at 7 p.m. ET on ESPN.

ALL IN ALL, it was not the best few months for Draymond Green. On June 10, during Game 4 of the NBA Finals against the Cavaliers, some 20 million viewers caught him in the act of trying to slap LeBron James in the groin. Three days later, after being suspended for that act, he watched his Warriors lose by 15 before dropping Games 6 and 7 in the greatest collapse in Finals history. In early July, he was arrested in East Lansing, Michigan, on an assault charge resulting from a scuffle in a college bar. Later that month, Green accidentally sent out a photo of his penis to the world.

By universal decree, the 2016-17 Warriors are a juggernaut. And if this juggernaut has a foundation, Green is it. Steph Curry is the reigning MVP; new acquisition Kevin Durant is one of the NBA's greatest scorers. But multiple Warriors staffers share the opinion that Green is their most important player. Nobody replicates his set of contributions. As one team official puts it: ""The guys might be frustrated by his antics, but they had an opportunity to prove themselves without him in Game 5 and they played like a bunch of [cowards].""

Herein lies the paradox of the perfectly constructed squad: It's built on ground that roils with lava -- and on the back of a man who has become increasingly unpredictable, emboldened and unaccountable.
Draymond Green had a very bad summer. But that weekslong meltdown was a year in the making. And to understand the tensions that could undermine this season's presumptive champion, you must first understand the untold story of what undid the Warriors a season ago.

IT'S JUNE 19, 2015, three days after the Warriors have claimed their first title in 40 years, and Oakland's victory parade has become quite the joyful Draymond Green showcase. More than a million fans lining the parade route have been treated to Green on the mic, slurring in E-40-style syntax: ""Cavaliers. Nope. We won? Yup. They suck? Yup."" And as that parade reaches the rally beside Oakland's Lake Merritt park, they are also treated to a glimpse of the often tense relationship between Green and his coach, Steve Kerr.
When it's his turn to address the crowd, Green, victory cap slightly askew, shambles across the podium, snatches the mic and declares that he's excited to be speaking. Golden State PR maestro Raymond Ridder, Green explains, ""tried not to let me talk today. He know I'm gonna get controversial.""

And then he proceeds to validate most all of Ridder's fears: ""With these guys, everything's fun. The only time it's not fun is practice ... film ... games ... bus rides. I'm the only person that gets talked about what shots I take and all those things by Steve Kerr. Like, every time I take a shot, he complains. So that's why, if you see, every time I make a shot, I look at him. Dude complain every time I take a shot.""

From his seat on the stage behind Green, Kerr shrugs and loudly counters: ""Twenty-four percent!"" Which just happens to be Green's 3-point shooting percentage during the final three rounds of the playoffs.
Green chuckles, bounds over, grabs Kerr from his chair and drags him to the podium. There are hypothetically a few drops of tension to be wrung from this moment. ""This my guy,"" Draymond starts, prompting Kerr to pat his chest. ""From the start of training camp, he hated me. That's no lie. He probably still hates me. That's no lie. But we going to keep winning these championships -- and that's no lie.""

Kerr, who's been gamely laughing at the display, steals the mic. ""You know how they start to play music at the Oscars when it starts to go on a little long and security comes and grabs the guy? That may happen here in a few minutes. Thanks, though, Draymond,"" he finally offers, before fleeing for the safety of his seat.

EVERYTHING IS GOOD in a victory parade. But before Green's arrival in 2012, the Warriors were a byword for bad. They had made the playoffs only once in the prior 18 seasons. In 2011-12, the lockout-shortened season, they'd won a dismal 23 games, losing 17 of their final 20 to land the seventh pick in the draft. With it, they were hoping to find a savior. Instead, they took Harrison Barnes. The real savior arrived at pick 35.
Green, who declined to comment for this story, was underestimated coming into college at Michigan State and then into the NBA -- famously so. The reasons are myriad, but perhaps the main one is this: His approach represents a hybrid, if not a revolution. It's an aggressive, American brashness mixed with an egalitarian, European insistence on moving the ball. Intuition tells us the greats score in bunches, creating their own shot at will. Green does everything save for creating his own shot. It's no coincidence he holds the record for plus-minus in a season. To hear Green yell, mid-drive to the basket, ""Hey! Steph!"" while directing his superstar toward an open space in the corner is to watch a player who not only sees the open man but who speaks his teammates into openness. ""He sees the game,"" says Warriors assistant and defensive guru Ron Adams.

There is another ineffable quality to the man: He just wants it more. It's an energy that overwhelms, fueled by what Kerr calls ""that competitive fire, that rage."" Or, as former teammate Leandro Barbosa once defined Green's optimal basketball mode: ""the guy that always gets mad, the guy everybody hates."" Indeed, his playing style is a constant assault. Every movement is efficient and vicious. He will come to your arena and play the villain, curse out your team, preen after every 3-pointer, light into the refs and possibly kick a foe where the sun doesn't shine.

Kerr once quipped of his team's appeal, ""We have a very likable group of guys -- other than Draymond."" The comment was said with a smile, meant with mirth. A lot of truth is said in jest, as the saying goes.
IT'S NOV. 27 in Phoenix, the 17th game of the Warriors' 2015-16 season, and there's nothing not to like about their performance so far. Over the summer, Kerr had predicted that the coming season would be their leap, that magical moment when last year's principles became reflexive. It happened, just not on Kerr's watch. The Warriors are undefeated, and their pattern is getting repetitive: Blow out the opponent, keep starters fresh with rest, keep bench guys happy with plenty of garbage-time run.

Up 25 with 4:14 left, this night is no different -- until Green fouls a driving Archie Goodwin. The action halts. Green helps Goodwin up from his fall as longtime NBA vet Jason Thompson saunters off the bench to check in for Green. The game, of course, is well beyond over, but Green pleads to stay in, shaking his head, holding his hand out in a ""wait"" signal before trudging to the end of the bench in a huff. Within a few seconds, an animated discussion ensues between him and interim coach Luke Walton. Green appears none too pleased. The reason: He is one rebound away from a triple-double.

After 25 seconds of game clock have elapsed, Green is back in front of the scorer's table, arms akimbo, ready to check in. He subs in at the timeout, and 52 seconds later, little-used guard Ian Clark misses a layup, which Green rebounds and lays in. On the very next possession, Green intentionally fouls Suns guard Devin Booker and lopes back to the bench, his mission complete.

A Warriors staffer would later say of the incident, ""Luke would have left him in had he known."" More to the point, as the interim coach, Walton already has enough on his plate without having to worry about aggravating his power forward. Indulging Green may have seemed the only realistic choice.

""Luke's my guy,"" Green would frequently say of his interim coach, even before Walton took the reins. The two were often seen laughing together during pushup challenges after practice. Both had charisma, but in different ways. Green was the loud life of the party; Walton operated at a languid pace that belied his quick wit.

When Walton took over for the first three months of the season, with Kerr sidelined due to complications from back surgery, he had assumed a light grip on the steering wheel. He was, for example, still rebounding for Green, just as he'd done as an assistant. Though the team had something of a power vacuum in Kerr's absence, Walton thought it best if he maintained his old duties, carrying on as though nothing were amiss.
The early results were historically good. The Warriors were dominating the league, dominating SportsCenter, Curry's incandescent start prompting teams to double-team him, allowing Green to make more plays than ever. Sixteen games into the season, Green had gone from averaging 3.7 assists a game the season before to 6.6, and a man who had tallied just two triple-doubles in his first three seasons was now a nightly triple-double threat. And nobody, apparently, was more aware of it than Green, who would end the regular season with 13 triple-doubles, the NBA's single-season record for power forwards. Suddenly far more than a ""glue guy,"" Green was a star, flourishing without restrictions. But such conditions and such outcomes? They make it hard to tell a man anything.

IT'S JAN. 17, the day after the Warriors' first blowout loss of the season, a 113-95 drubbing by the Pistons. The team is holding practice in a snow-covered Michigan high school, at a remove from the camera flashes and screaming fans that await at nearly every practice in an arena. Walton begins his walk from the court to the assembled reporters in the corner of the gym. On practice days, it's traditional for the coach to kick off media interviews. But when Walton is within a few feet of the cameras, Green interjects, with a grin: ""Luke! So we lose a game and you stop f---ing rebounding for me?!?""

The statement is said with no evident malice, but it halts Walton in his tracks. He shoots the media gaggle a glance, then turns, runs right over and starts shagging balls for his player.

IN RETROSPECT, IT'S hard to argue with any approach that leads to a record-setting regular season. Walton's strategy of Green indulgence coincided with the most successful run a rookie coach had ever seen, a 39 -- 4 start that did much to net Walton a head-coaching gig with the Lakers.

For Golden State's coaching staff, there was also realpolitik to handling Kerr's absence. Concessions had to be made, given Green's force of personality. On Dec. 11, in Boston, the Warriors had endured a high-intensity double overtime for the final victory of their historic 24-game winning streak to open the season. It was the first of a back-to-back, at the end of a brutal seven-game, two-week road trip out East. They were banged up, weary from the winning streak's onslaught of attention and pressure.

After the Boston win, Golden State's coaches had met to assess the situation. Together, they had decided to rest starters the next night in Milwaukee. But that plan was dashed after they walked in on the end of an impassioned speech by Green to teammates about the once-in-a-lifetime chance they had to chase the all-time record for wins. This team is on the edge of history! Green was yelling. These moments only come along so often! This was not uncommon. Throughout the season, Green, in the guise of motivation, would berate his co-workers during games and practices; on multiple occasions he had to be separated from teammates.

""Draymond f---ed up practice and s---,"" then-Warriors center Marreese Speights says. ""Draymond's a good guy, but I think at the end of the day, it hurt the whole chemistry of the year."" One player in particular, he says, took much of the heat: ""Draymond and Klay got into it a lot."" (Thompson declined to comment for this story.)
A code of conduct exists within the NBA. Some yelling is expected, but vets do not accept frequent Bobby Knight -- style haranguings from younger players. Or, as Speights puts it, ""Guys don't respect you if you yell at them in front of all these fans. We're not trying to lose the game. F --.""

And so it was that an hour before a win over the Lakers on Nov. 24, almost two months prior to his return to the sideline, Kerr visited with the team to deliver a speech on his four core values: joy, mindfulness, competition and compassion. According to team sources, the emphasis on compassion was meant as a message to Green.

IT'S JAN. 30 in Philadelphia, and Kerr is patrolling the sideline. One week earlier, Kerr had finally returned -- far from cured, still fighting chronic pain. Partly hastening his return, according to team sources: The Warriors had grown unruly after three months under Walton. Someone needed to take back control.
Green, with 10 points, 10 boards and 6 assists at the end of the second quarter, has another triple-double in his sights. But at halftime, with the Warriors up 19, Kerr informs Green that if he's angling for a triple-double tonight, against the consensus worst team in the NBA, it will have to come by the third quarter. No more of this playing-in-garbage-time-for-stats nonsense. That edict will lead to an unintended consequence.

On the first play of the second half, Green gets the ball with an open lane to the rim but stops short in favor of setting a ball screen and trying to lead a cutting Klay Thompson with a pass. Turnover. Green begins spraying passes all over the court on his way to seven turnovers. A 19-point fourth-quarter lead dissolves to nothing. On the game's second-to-last play, with the score tied, the Warriors avert disaster only when Green finds Barnes in the corner for a 3 with 0.2 of a second remaining. It's Green's ninth assist.

Green will confess after the game to his role in what went wrong: ""We started turning the ball over due to my selfish unselfishness, and it was all downhill from there."" When asked later about Green's comments, Kerr will commend his honesty. But though the Warriors continue to win -- 20 victories in their first 22 games following Kerr's return -- something has changed. Green goes into a shooting slump, or perhaps a shooting shrink. Under Walton, he had attempted 3.6 3s per game, making 41.4 percent of them. After Kerr's return, he's averaged 0.6 3-point attempts and made 28.6 percent.

Kerr is back. Green is diminished. And the correlation cannot be ignored.

IT'S FEB. 27 in Oklahoma City, during halftime of a nationally televised game, and Green is losing his holy mind. Inside the visitors locker room, he's hollering ""I am not a robot!"" at Kerr. When Kerr tells him to sit down, Green screams, ""Motherf---er, come sit me down!"" When he goes after Kerr, his teammates, including Curry and Thompson, step in to stave off disaster.

Minutes later, in her report following halftime, ESPN sideline reporter Lisa Salters will recite a portion of Green's explosion: ""I am not a robot! I know I can play! You have me messed up right now! If you don't want me to shoot, I won't shoot the rest of the game!""
""I'm standing outside the locker room with the Oklahoma City police, which are always stationed outside of every locker room,"" Salters will later recall. ""They kind of moved me aside, and the officer just kind of stood by the door, with his hand on his weapon like he was trying to determine what he should do. It was clear that something bad was about to happen in this locker room. We've never heard anything like this before.""

Salters, with all of 50 seconds available for her report, had, in truth, conveyed only a fraction of the situation -- one so unnerving that at least one arena security official moved outside the locker room door in a SWAT-team pose. Throughout the night, Salters would be assailed by fans on Twitter, arguing that she should not have reported what had happened in the locker room. But this was not a private moment unscrupulously divulged to the public; it was a private moment so forceful it breached the walls of its sanctum. ""This was something extraordinary that was happening,"" Salters says.

Publicly, the Warriors downplay the incident. At the next practice, Kerr says, ""It's the NBA. Every team I've ever been on has had stuff like this. Every team. Championship teams or not, it happens. It's 15 alpha males in a room trying to compete, money on the line and prestige and trophies and competition. This is being so overblown.""

Privately, according to sources close to the team, Green's teammates respond by voting to fine him. (When asked a week later about the fine, a livid Green would insist, ""I asked to be fined. You can report that!"") Green also does not take kindly to the coverage of his outburst, which leads to the Warriors brokering a sit-down between him and Salters. Salters recalls telling him, ""What kind of bothered me about it was hearing the pain that was in your voice -- you weren't just mad, you were in pain, emotional pain.""

Kerr maintains that what happened, while unusual, was not unique. ""If it didn't happen, it would be kind of weird,"" he says. ""It would be like nobody is revealing anything to each other. You have to let stuff out as a team. Rage means that's happening.""
Then Kerr pauses and, as if acknowledging something that can't be swept aside, offers: ""You have to find the edge, you find the balance. About two years ago, [Draymond] was good. This last year, a couple of times he went over the brink. That's the challenge.""
INSOFAR AS THERE can be unanimity regarding the unknown, the Warriors believe this: The 2016 title would have been theirs if not for Green's Game 5 suspension, the penalty he earned in the waning moments of Game 4 by swiping at LeBron's genitals after James guided his undercarriage over the back of Green's skull. Few things capture the beautiful absurdity of sports quite like this moment deciding a championship, a moment Speights frames as, ""If somebody put they balls on your head, what are you supposed to do?""

In response, the Warriors had united around Green, with the two most powerful team executives rising in defense of their guy. Owner Joe Lacob, who due to his brashness is often internally referred to as the Draymond of his operation, sported a Green jersey at Game 5. Meanwhile, Warriors GM Bob Myers watched the proceedings alongside Green in a suite at the O.co Coliseum. After that Game 5 loss, and the collapse in Games 6 and 7, when Green had apologized to his teammates in his final news conference, Kerr had insisted that Green had nothing to apologize for: ""Without you, we're not even here.""

But herein lies the problem the Warriors have to solve. By so often defending Green publicly, the franchise might also be sending him the message that he doesn't need to confront the central tension of his career: that what makes him great on the court -- the passion and drive, the recklessness and ego -- threatens to undermine him off it.

Consider how he responded at Team USA minicamp when he was asked about the East Lansing incident, in which Green reportedly slapped a man who'd been heckling him in a bar, and in which Green wasn't allowed to leave jail, according to the police report, ""until completely sober."" Did he need to adjust his behavior? With a grin, Green replied, ""Being me has gotten me this far."" Two weeks later, he shared his genitals with the world.

There is, in truth, a note of resignation in how team officials discuss Green these days. More than one expressed that what transpired in East Lansing is indivisible from what makes Green such a maddeningly effective on-court opponent. More than one expressed that this would be a permanent issue.

Myers, for his part, says he's the wrong person to ask. ""I have some blind spots for Draymond,"" he says. ""I know that's probably not the right answer. Yeah, he could do some things differently. He'd be the first to acknowledge that. He had a lot come to him, maybe unexpectedly, as far as fame and things like that. But if caring too much is your problem? Or living too much? Well, you can fix those things, I hope. Trying to get someone to care or have emotion? That's harder to do.""
Two years ago, Green escaped the realm of role player by dint of talent but also pride. Pride is what fueled a rise far beyond modest expectations. The issue is what pride becomes once massively validated. To hear many around the Warriors tell it, it's turned into an ego on overdrive and metastasized into something that imperils the team's stability well beyond the 2016 Finals.

All of which leaves Kerr in a suboptimal situation. As much as he might want Green to stop making the wrong kind of news, he's wary of sabotaging Green's id, the part of him he most needs as the coach of a team that won 73 games last season. ""The dangerous thing is,"" Kerr says, ""if you try to temper him too much, are you taking away his edge?"" And should Kerr attempt to counter Green's excesses, there's seemingly little organizational support. ""He's on an island,"" one Warriors official says of Kerr.
Indeed, ask most team officials about how Green approaches life off the court and they routinely answer with a go-to phrase that's one part scouting report, one part absolution: ""He gets after it."" Despite the arrest (for which he ultimately reached a plea deal), despite the penis pic, despite Green's Snapchat of a 118 mph drive toward Oakland's heavily trafficked Caldecott Tunnel, how much, they note, can teams credibly focus on off-hours behavior in a league that has routinely seen players who ""get after it"" bring more energy than their opponents?

There is, to be sure, a ""boys will be boys"" ethos in the NBA that condones a high level of hedonism, as long as the player produces. Still, the chorus of murmurs around Green is growing -- not because his production is suffering but because his discretion is. As one Warriors official says, ""There's an a--hole in every bar. The question is, why are you winding up in that situation?"" And as one NBA team executive says of Green's behavior, and its potential to subvert a potential dynasty, ""He's what will ultimately prevent them from having long-term success.""

THREE YEARS AGO, the Warriors had a mystery on their hands. Team trainers were noticing that the stationary bikes in their practice facility had become rather unstationary. More to the point, they were disappearing. Eventually, the mystery was solved. Green was dragging the stationary cycles to the sauna and leaving them there to soak.

It turned out that Green, who's struggled with his weight since his days at Michigan State, had developed a theory: By riding the bikes in the sauna, he could more efficiently shed pounds. In the short term, biking in a sauna will do that, but much of what is lost is water weight and is soon gained back. Golden State trainers were aware that Green's regimen was, at best, scientifically dubious. Also, the bikes were getting ruined. Says a former Golden State trainer: ""He would come in and say, 'The screen's not working on the bike.' And I'd be like, 'Yeah, I wonder why.'""

Still, the team chose to ultimately allow it. It did involve cardio. And Green was loath to give it up. At the end of the day, success trusts its routine, no matter how absurd, grueling or dangerous to electronic equipment it might be.

And so it goes with the Warriors and their enigmatic star. The team indulges his more questionable behavior -- the late-night mischief, the berating of teammates, the feuding with coaches, the waterboarding of bikes -- because in doing so it has enabled him to become perhaps the best two-way player in the league. On the other hand, it might also have cost them a championship.

The Warriors have a problem to solve. The success of Draymond Green is inextricably wrapped up in the enigma of Draymond Green. There is, after all, more than one way to enable a man.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,80649,public,self,Strauss: Golden State’s Draymond Green problem,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ft117r/strauss_golden_states_draymond_green_problem/,some_ads,7,,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'T8qJRolkE8zdwkw0dsbvhwr3T8ihVb4CtgZI8HxDiHs', 'resolutions': [{'height': 60, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fjohdEx6wrKZ4KZGxkX3gLs-2szmhb0IvSxB5ZVPaGM.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ddbf15513fb44b8ac5c863d235e124289635068', 'width': 108}, {'height': 121, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fjohdEx6wrKZ4KZGxkX3gLs-2szmhb0IvSxB5ZVPaGM.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed5f69f61d40595c1f43708729d871b89d4cd118', 'width': 216}, {'height': 180, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fjohdEx6wrKZ4KZGxkX3gLs-2szmhb0IvSxB5ZVPaGM.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efc2453e7f2c7f95a9bf51028724ff79225f53ee', 'width': 320}, {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fjohdEx6wrKZ4KZGxkX3gLs-2szmhb0IvSxB5ZVPaGM.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=991331306d01fb2c7ed32d01d12927724c45e7e8', 'width': 640}, {'height': 540, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fjohdEx6wrKZ4KZGxkX3gLs-2szmhb0IvSxB5ZVPaGM.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91ab7fb40a6ad0d2c52ab1e0de339e08a536a27c', 'width': 960}, {'height': 607, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fjohdEx6wrKZ4KZGxkX3gLs-2szmhb0IvSxB5ZVPaGM.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfbbb5aeaa7af0f4b034fa1652e137010213dae3', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 729, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fjohdEx6wrKZ4KZGxkX3gLs-2szmhb0IvSxB5ZVPaGM.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=d41263fbbf79a274a58f0d1207295f7b6c0be306', 'width': 1296}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,

This is the inside story of how Warriors forward Draymond Green is the player to lead the Warriors to a dynasty -- or the man who could stand in their way.

Editor's note: This story on Draymond Green was originally published on Oct. 19, 2016 and contains explicit language. Watch Game 5 of the 2016 NBA Finals on Wednesday at 7 p.m. ET on ESPN.

ALL IN ALL, it was not the best few months for Draymond Green. On June 10, during Game 4 of the NBA Finals against the Cavaliers, some 20 million viewers caught him in the act of trying to slap LeBron James in the groin. Three days later, after being suspended for that act, he watched his Warriors lose by 15 before dropping Games 6 and 7 in the greatest collapse in Finals history. In early July, he was arrested in East Lansing, Michigan, on an assault charge resulting from a scuffle in a college bar. Later that month, Green accidentally sent out a photo of his penis to the world.

By universal decree, the 2016-17 Warriors are a juggernaut. And if this juggernaut has a foundation, Green is it. Steph Curry is the reigning MVP; new acquisition Kevin Durant is one of the NBA's greatest scorers. But multiple Warriors staffers share the opinion that Green is their most important player. Nobody replicates his set of contributions. As one team official puts it: ""The guys might be frustrated by his antics, but they had an opportunity to prove themselves without him in Game 5 and they played like a bunch of [cowards].""

Herein lies the paradox of the perfectly constructed squad: It's built on ground that roils with lava -- and on the back of a man who has become increasingly unpredictable, emboldened and unaccountable.
Draymond Green had a very bad summer. But that weekslong meltdown was a year in the making. And to understand the tensions that could undermine this season's presumptive champion, you must first understand the untold story of what undid the Warriors a season ago.

IT'S JUNE 19, 2015, three days after the Warriors have claimed their first title in 40 years, and Oakland's victory parade has become quite the joyful Draymond Green showcase. More than a million fans lining the parade route have been treated to Green on the mic, slurring in E-40-style syntax: ""Cavaliers. Nope. We won? Yup. They suck? Yup."" And as that parade reaches the rally beside Oakland's Lake Merritt park, they are also treated to a glimpse of the often tense relationship between Green and his coach, Steve Kerr.
When it's his turn to address the crowd, Green, victory cap slightly askew, shambles across the podium, snatches the mic and declares that he's excited to be speaking. Golden State PR maestro Raymond Ridder, Green explains, ""tried not to let me talk today. He know I'm gonna get controversial.""

And then he proceeds to validate most all of Ridder's fears: ""With these guys, everything's fun. The only time it's not fun is practice ... film ... games ... bus rides. I'm the only person that gets talked about what shots I take and all those things by Steve Kerr. Like, every time I take a shot, he complains. So that's why, if you see, every time I make a shot, I look at him. Dude complain every time I take a shot.""

From his seat on the stage behind Green, Kerr shrugs and loudly counters: ""Twenty-four percent!"" Which just happens to be Green's 3-point shooting percentage during the final three rounds of the playoffs.
Green chuckles, bounds over, grabs Kerr from his chair and drags him to the podium. There are hypothetically a few drops of tension to be wrung from this moment. ""This my guy,"" Draymond starts, prompting Kerr to pat his chest. ""From the start of training camp, he hated me. That's no lie. He probably still hates me. That's no lie. But we going to keep winning these championships -- and that's no lie.""

Kerr, who's been gamely laughing at the display, steals the mic. ""You know how they start to play music at the Oscars when it starts to go on a little long and security comes and grabs the guy? That may happen here in a few minutes. Thanks, though, Draymond,"" he finally offers, before fleeing for the safety of his seat.

EVERYTHING IS GOOD in a victory parade. But before Green's arrival in 2012, the Warriors were a byword for bad. They had made the playoffs only once in the prior 18 seasons. In 2011-12, the lockout-shortened season, they'd won a dismal 23 games, losing 17 of their final 20 to land the seventh pick in the draft. With it, they were hoping to find a savior. Instead, they took Harrison Barnes. The real savior arrived at pick 35.
Green, who declined to comment for this story, was underestimated coming into college at Michigan State and then into the NBA -- famously so. The reasons are myriad, but perhaps the main one is this: His approach represents a hybrid, if not a revolution. It's an aggressive, American brashness mixed with an egalitarian, European insistence on moving the ball. Intuition tells us the greats score in bunches, creating their own shot at will. Green does everything save for creating his own shot. It's no coincidence he holds the record for plus-minus in a season. To hear Green yell, mid-drive to the basket, ""Hey! Steph!"" while directing his superstar toward an open space in the corner is to watch a player who not only sees the open man but who speaks his teammates into openness. ""He sees the game,"" says Warriors assistant and defensive guru Ron Adams.

There is another ineffable quality to the man: He just wants it more. It's an energy that overwhelms, fueled by what Kerr calls ""that competitive fire, that rage."" Or, as former teammate Leandro Barbosa once defined Green's optimal basketball mode: ""the guy that always gets mad, the guy everybody hates."" Indeed, his playing style is a constant assault. Every movement is efficient and vicious. He will come to your arena and play the villain, curse out your team, preen after every 3-pointer, light into the refs and possibly kick a foe where the sun doesn't shine.

Kerr once quipped of his team's appeal, ""We have a very likable group of guys -- other than Draymond."" The comment was said with a smile, meant with mirth. A lot of truth is said in jest, as the saying goes.
IT'S NOV. 27 in Phoenix, the 17th game of the Warriors' 2015-16 season, and there's nothing not to like about their performance so far. Over the summer, Kerr had predicted that the coming season would be their leap, that magical moment when last year's principles became reflexive. It happened, just not on Kerr's watch. The Warriors are undefeated, and their pattern is getting repetitive: Blow out the opponent, keep starters fresh with rest, keep bench guys happy with plenty of garbage-time run.

Up 25 with 4:14 left, this night is no different -- until Green fouls a driving Archie Goodwin. The action halts. Green helps Goodwin up from his fall as longtime NBA vet Jason Thompson saunters off the bench to check in for Green. The game, of course, is well beyond over, but Green pleads to stay in, shaking his head, holding his hand out in a ""wait"" signal before trudging to the end of the bench in a huff. Within a few seconds, an animated discussion ensues between him and interim coach Luke Walton. Green appears none too pleased. The reason: He is one rebound away from a triple-double.

After 25 seconds of game clock have elapsed, Green is back in front of the scorer's table, arms akimbo, ready to check in. He subs in at the timeout, and 52 seconds later, little-used guard Ian Clark misses a layup, which Green rebounds and lays in. On the very next possession, Green intentionally fouls Suns guard Devin Booker and lopes back to the bench, his mission complete.

A Warriors staffer would later say of the incident, ""Luke would have left him in had he known."" More to the point, as the interim coach, Walton already has enough on his plate without having to worry about aggravating his power forward. Indulging Green may have seemed the only realistic choice.

""Luke's my guy,"" Green would frequently say of his interim coach, even before Walton took the reins. The two were often seen laughing together during pushup challenges after practice. Both had charisma, but in different ways. Green was the loud life of the party; Walton operated at a languid pace that belied his quick wit.

When Walton took over for the first three months of the season, with Kerr sidelined due to complications from back surgery, he had assumed a light grip on the steering wheel. He was, for example, still rebounding for Green, just as he'd done as an assistant. Though the team had something of a power vacuum in Kerr's absence, Walton thought it best if he maintained his old duties, carrying on as though nothing were amiss.
The early results were historically good. The Warriors were dominating the league, dominating SportsCenter, Curry's incandescent start prompting teams to double-team him, allowing Green to make more plays than ever. Sixteen games into the season, Green had gone from averaging 3.7 assists a game the season before to 6.6, and a man who had tallied just two triple-doubles in his first three seasons was now a nightly triple-double threat. And nobody, apparently, was more aware of it than Green, who would end the regular season with 13 triple-doubles, the NBA's single-season record for power forwards. Suddenly far more than a ""glue guy,"" Green was a star, flourishing without restrictions. But such conditions and such outcomes? They make it hard to tell a man anything.

IT'S JAN. 17, the day after the Warriors' first blowout loss of the season, a 113-95 drubbing by the Pistons. The team is holding practice in a snow-covered Michigan high school, at a remove from the camera flashes and screaming fans that await at nearly every practice in an arena. Walton begins his walk from the court to the assembled reporters in the corner of the gym. On practice days, it's traditional for the coach to kick off media interviews. But when Walton is within a few feet of the cameras, Green interjects, with a grin: ""Luke! So we lose a game and you stop f---ing rebounding for me?!?""

The statement is said with no evident malice, but it halts Walton in his tracks. He shoots the media gaggle a glance, then turns, runs right over and starts shagging balls for his player.

IN RETROSPECT, IT'S hard to argue with any approach that leads to a record-setting regular season. Walton's strategy of Green indulgence coincided with the most successful run a rookie coach had ever seen, a 39 -- 4 start that did much to net Walton a head-coaching gig with the Lakers.

For Golden State's coaching staff, there was also realpolitik to handling Kerr's absence. Concessions had to be made, given Green's force of personality. On Dec. 11, in Boston, the Warriors had endured a high-intensity double overtime for the final victory of their historic 24-game winning streak to open the season. It was the first of a back-to-back, at the end of a brutal seven-game, two-week road trip out East. They were banged up, weary from the winning streak's onslaught of attention and pressure.

After the Boston win, Golden State's coaches had met to assess the situation. Together, they had decided to rest starters the next night in Milwaukee. But that plan was dashed after they walked in on the end of an impassioned speech by Green to teammates about the once-in-a-lifetime chance they had to chase the all-time record for wins. This team is on the edge of history! Green was yelling. These moments only come along so often! This was not uncommon. Throughout the season, Green, in the guise of motivation, would berate his co-workers during games and practices; on multiple occasions he had to be separated from teammates.

""Draymond f---ed up practice and s---,"" then-Warriors center Marreese Speights says. ""Draymond's a good guy, but I think at the end of the day, it hurt the whole chemistry of the year."" One player in particular, he says, took much of the heat: ""Draymond and Klay got into it a lot."" (Thompson declined to comment for this story.)
A code of conduct exists within the NBA. Some yelling is expected, but vets do not accept frequent Bobby Knight -- style haranguings from younger players. Or, as Speights puts it, ""Guys don't respect you if you yell at them in front of all these fans. We're not trying to lose the game. F --.""

And so it was that an hour before a win over the Lakers on Nov. 24, almost two months prior to his return to the sideline, Kerr visited with the team to deliver a speech on his four core values: joy, mindfulness, competition and compassion. According to team sources, the emphasis on compassion was meant as a message to Green.

IT'S JAN. 30 in Philadelphia, and Kerr is patrolling the sideline. One week earlier, Kerr had finally returned -- far from cured, still fighting chronic pain. Partly hastening his return, according to team sources: The Warriors had grown unruly after three months under Walton. Someone needed to take back control.
Green, with 10 points, 10 boards and 6 assists at the end of the second quarter, has another triple-double in his sights. But at halftime, with the Warriors up 19, Kerr informs Green that if he's angling for a triple-double tonight, against the consensus worst team in the NBA, it will have to come by the third quarter. No more of this playing-in-garbage-time-for-stats nonsense. That edict will lead to an unintended consequence.

On the first play of the second half, Green gets the ball with an open lane to the rim but stops short in favor of setting a ball screen and trying to lead a cutting Klay Thompson with a pass. Turnover. Green begins spraying passes all over the court on his way to seven turnovers. A 19-point fourth-quarter lead dissolves to nothing. On the game's second-to-last play, with the score tied, the Warriors avert disaster only when Green finds Barnes in the corner for a 3 with 0.2 of a second remaining. It's Green's ninth assist.

Green will confess after the game to his role in what went wrong: ""We started turning the ball over due to my selfish unselfishness, and it was all downhill from there."" When asked later about Green's comments, Kerr will commend his honesty. But though the Warriors continue to win -- 20 victories in their first 22 games following Kerr's return -- something has changed. Green goes into a shooting slump, or perhaps a shooting shrink. Under Walton, he had attempted 3.6 3s per game, making 41.4 percent of them. After Kerr's return, he's averaged 0.6 3-point attempts and made 28.6 percent.

Kerr is back. Green is diminished. And the correlation cannot be ignored.

IT'S FEB. 27 in Oklahoma City, during halftime of a nationally televised game, and Green is losing his holy mind. Inside the visitors locker room, he's hollering ""I am not a robot!"" at Kerr. When Kerr tells him to sit down, Green screams, ""Motherf---er, come sit me down!"" When he goes after Kerr, his teammates, including Curry and Thompson, step in to stave off disaster.

Minutes later, in her report following halftime, ESPN sideline reporter Lisa Salters will recite a portion of Green's explosion: ""I am not a robot! I know I can play! You have me messed up right now! If you don't want me to shoot, I won't shoot the rest of the game!""
""I'm standing outside the locker room with the Oklahoma City police, which are always stationed outside of every locker room,"" Salters will later recall. ""They kind of moved me aside, and the officer just kind of stood by the door, with his hand on his weapon like he was trying to determine what he should do. It was clear that something bad was about to happen in this locker room. We've never heard anything like this before.""

Salters, with all of 50 seconds available for her report, had, in truth, conveyed only a fraction of the situation -- one so unnerving that at least one arena security official moved outside the locker room door in a SWAT-team pose. Throughout the night, Salters would be assailed by fans on Twitter, arguing that she should not have reported what had happened in the locker room. But this was not a private moment unscrupulously divulged to the public; it was a private moment so forceful it breached the walls of its sanctum. ""This was something extraordinary that was happening,"" Salters says.

Publicly, the Warriors downplay the incident. At the next practice, Kerr says, ""It's the NBA. Every team I've ever been on has had stuff like this. Every team. Championship teams or not, it happens. It's 15 alpha males in a room trying to compete, money on the line and prestige and trophies and competition. This is being so overblown.""

Privately, according to sources close to the team, Green's teammates respond by voting to fine him. (When asked a week later about the fine, a livid Green would insist, ""I asked to be fined. You can report that!"") Green also does not take kindly to the coverage of his outburst, which leads to the Warriors brokering a sit-down between him and Salters. Salters recalls telling him, ""What kind of bothered me about it was hearing the pain that was in your voice -- you weren't just mad, you were in pain, emotional pain.""

Kerr maintains that what happened, while unusual, was not unique. ""If it didn't happen, it would be kind of weird,"" he says. ""It would be like nobody is revealing anything to each other. You have to let stuff out as a team. Rage means that's happening.""
Then Kerr pauses and, as if acknowledging something that can't be swept aside, offers: ""You have to find the edge, you find the balance. About two years ago, [Draymond] was good. This last year, a couple of times he went over the brink. That's the challenge.""
INSOFAR AS THERE can be unanimity regarding the unknown, the Warriors believe this: The 2016 title would have been theirs if not for Green's Game 5 suspension, the penalty he earned in the waning moments of Game 4 by swiping at LeBron's genitals after James guided his undercarriage over the back of Green's skull. Few things capture the beautiful absurdity of sports quite like this moment deciding a championship, a moment Speights frames as, ""If somebody put they balls on your head, what are you supposed to do?""

In response, the Warriors had united around Green, with the two most powerful team executives rising in defense of their guy. Owner Joe Lacob, who due to his brashness is often internally referred to as the Draymond of his operation, sported a Green jersey at Game 5. Meanwhile, Warriors GM Bob Myers watched the proceedings alongside Green in a suite at the O.co Coliseum. After that Game 5 loss, and the collapse in Games 6 and 7, when Green had apologized to his teammates in his final news conference, Kerr had insisted that Green had nothing to apologize for: ""Without you, we're not even here.""

But herein lies the problem the Warriors have to solve. By so often defending Green publicly, the franchise might also be sending him the message that he doesn't need to confront the central tension of his career: that what makes him great on the court -- the passion and drive, the recklessness and ego -- threatens to undermine him off it.

Consider how he responded at Team USA minicamp when he was asked about the East Lansing incident, in which Green reportedly slapped a man who'd been heckling him in a bar, and in which Green wasn't allowed to leave jail, according to the police report, ""until completely sober."" Did he need to adjust his behavior? With a grin, Green replied, ""Being me has gotten me this far."" Two weeks later, he shared his genitals with the world.

There is, in truth, a note of resignation in how team officials discuss Green these days. More than one expressed that what transpired in East Lansing is indivisible from what makes Green such a maddeningly effective on-court opponent. More than one expressed that this would be a permanent issue.

Myers, for his part, says he's the wrong person to ask. ""I have some blind spots for Draymond,"" he says. ""I know that's probably not the right answer. Yeah, he could do some things differently. He'd be the first to acknowledge that. He had a lot come to him, maybe unexpectedly, as far as fame and things like that. But if caring too much is your problem? Or living too much? Well, you can fix those things, I hope. Trying to get someone to care or have emotion? That's harder to do.""
Two years ago, Green escaped the realm of role player by dint of talent but also pride. Pride is what fueled a rise far beyond modest expectations. The issue is what pride becomes once massively validated. To hear many around the Warriors tell it, it's turned into an ego on overdrive and metastasized into something that imperils the team's stability well beyond the 2016 Finals.

All of which leaves Kerr in a suboptimal situation. As much as he might want Green to stop making the wrong kind of news, he's wary of sabotaging Green's id, the part of him he most needs as the coach of a team that won 73 games last season. ""The dangerous thing is,"" Kerr says, ""if you try to temper him too much, are you taking away his edge?"" And should Kerr attempt to counter Green's excesses, there's seemingly little organizational support. ""He's on an island,"" one Warriors official says of Kerr.
Indeed, ask most team officials about how Green approaches life off the court and they routinely answer with a go-to phrase that's one part scouting report, one part absolution: ""He gets after it."" Despite the arrest (for which he ultimately reached a plea deal), despite the penis pic, despite Green's Snapchat of a 118 mph drive toward Oakland's heavily trafficked Caldecott Tunnel, how much, they note, can teams credibly focus on off-hours behavior in a league that has routinely seen players who ""get after it"" bring more energy than their opponents?

There is, to be sure, a ""boys will be boys"" ethos in the NBA that condones a high level of hedonism, as long as the player produces. Still, the chorus of murmurs around Green is growing -- not because his production is suffering but because his discretion is. As one Warriors official says, ""There's an a--hole in every bar. The question is, why are you winding up in that situation?"" And as one NBA team executive says of Green's behavior, and its potential to subvert a potential dynasty, ""He's what will ultimately prevent them from having long-term success.""

THREE YEARS AGO, the Warriors had a mystery on their hands. Team trainers were noticing that the stationary bikes in their practice facility had become rather unstationary. More to the point, they were disappearing. Eventually, the mystery was solved. Green was dragging the stationary cycles to the sauna and leaving them there to soak.

It turned out that Green, who's struggled with his weight since his days at Michigan State, had developed a theory: By riding the bikes in the sauna, he could more efficiently shed pounds. In the short term, biking in a sauna will do that, but much of what is lost is water weight and is soon gained back. Golden State trainers were aware that Green's regimen was, at best, scientifically dubious. Also, the bikes were getting ruined. Says a former Golden State trainer: ""He would come in and say, 'The screen's not working on the bike.' And I'd be like, 'Yeah, I wonder why.'""

Still, the team chose to ultimately allow it. It did involve cardio. And Green was loath to give it up. At the end of the day, success trusts its routine, no matter how absurd, grueling or dangerous to electronic equipment it might be.

And so it goes with the Warriors and their enigmatic star. The team indulges his more questionable behavior -- the late-night mischief, the berating of teammates, the feuding with coaches, the waterboarding of bikes -- because in doing so it has enabled him to become perhaps the best two-way player in the league. On the other hand, it might also have cost them a championship.

The Warriors have a problem to solve. The success of Draymond Green is inextricably wrapped up in the enigma of Draymond Green.

postseason.\n\nhttps://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26833111/what-draymond-sees-warriors-star-details-unique-game\n\nI quoted some interesting parts I found interesting below:\n\n- - - \n\n**Play No. 1: Dray and Klay vs CP3 and Capela**\n\n[Video](https://media.video-cdn.espn.com/gifs/mp4/dm_190524_PROG_NBA_WCRD2_G1_Rockets_v_Warriors_BKNK_1063_4_28_2019_ARCHIVE_2gif.mp4)\n\nIt looks so simple -- Klay Thompson and Green negotiating a standard pick-and-roll. But Clint Capela\'s screen drills Thompson. Chris Paul comes open on the other side. Green slides toward Paul, and appears ready to switch onto him. And then, bam: Thompson recovers, Green slides back to Capela, and a window that opened wide for a split second is slammed shut.\n\nHow did Green know not to switch? How did Thompson know what Green would do?\n\n&gt;*Chris is always going to be a pass-first player. He\'s coming off to his left hand. I know he\'s not comfortable coming off to his left hand. The chances of him just firing are slim.*\n\n&gt;*I know when we\'ve been switching, they\'ve made it a point to try to hit Capela on the dive. If Klay gets nailed like that and I jump to switch, there\'s no way Klay gets back to affect that pass to Capela.*\n\n&gt;*And I know -- Klay is a ball hawk. If he doesn\'t hear ""switch,"" he\'s going to chase the ball.*\n\nLook at Green\'s feet as Paul sizes him up: [PIC](https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2019/0530/DRAYFEET.PNG)\n\nHis left foot is directly in front of his right foot; his hips are wide open. That\'s a little unusual -- some coaches would say dangerous -- and Green does it a lot. Why? It\'s about weight distribution and recovery speed. Green can plant on that left foot, convince Paul he is moving forward, and push off that same foot to begin his retreat to Capela.\n\n&gt;*If my left foot is up, it\'s going to tell [Paul] I\'m coming to him. If my feet are parallel to half court, there\'s no way I can drop back at the rate I need to. I\'m back on my heels that way. I can\'t jump. The only other way I can get back to [Capela] that way is to turn and sprint, which takes another second. If I\'ve got one foot up, I can play a cat-and-mouse game with the ball-handler and the roller. For a split second, it allows me to guard two people even though I\'m not all the way up to the 3-point line.*\n\n&gt;*My uncle [Bennie Baber, Green\'s coach during elementary school] taught me to play defense with one foot in front of the other. You have to be careful of giving somebody a lane. But my mindset on that is different: If I open my hips like that and I give you that way, I know you\'re going that way and I can react better.*\n\n&gt;*You\'re taught to send some guys to their weak hand. But one thing I\'ve figured out -- some guys, I like to send to their strong hand, because I know exactly what you\'re gonna do. That gives me a better chance.*\n\n&gt;*If I try to send you to your weak hand, chances are you\'re a great player -- if I\'m worried which hand I\'m gonna send you to, you\'ve made a living out of still getting to that strong hand. So now I\'m guessing what you\'re gonna do as opposed to knowing, ""OK, I know he\'s going this way.""*\n\n- - - \n\n**Play No. 2: Draymond messing with CJ McCollum and Evan Turner**\n\n[Video](https://media.video-cdn.espn.com/gifs/mp4/dm_190524_PROG_NBA_WCF_G2_Trial_Blazers_v_Warriors_BKNQ_421_ERD1_5_16_2019_DCIO_2gif.mp4)\n\nHow is Green, like, everywhere before the Blazers expect him?\n\n&gt;*I\'m at the free throw line analyzing the entire possession. I know it\'s CJ [McCollum] coming off, so it has to be a blitz. At that point, it\'s really Klay\'s rotation [to Meyers Leonard at the rim]. He\'s the low man.*\n\n[PIC](https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2019/0530/KLAY.PNG)\n\n&gt;*But Klay is guarding Damian Lillard. So we\'d rather not have Klay go help. If he does, we\'re leaving a 2-on-1 on the weak side with Dame and Seth [Curry]. We don\'t want that. I\'m guarding the non-shooter, so I\'m the help man.*\n\nBefore Green slides to Leonard, he takes a half-step in McCollum\'s direction. The pass to Leonard appears open.\n\n&gt;*CJ has Andre [Iguodala] and [Kevon Looney] on him. CJ\'s 6-3? The likelihood of him seeing that pass and actually getting it through is slim to none.*\n\nAnd then comes perhaps Green\'s hallmark defensive play: winning a one-on-two situation by stunting at Evan Turner, and baiting Turner into a lob pass. Green is already on his way back to tip that pass before Turner releases the ball.\n\n&gt;*I am going to force Evan Turner to hit this shot from the foul line. Chances are, he probably won\'t even take it. What I can\'t give up is the automatic two with the lob. I stunt at him to make him think I\'m coming, but I\'m never going to Evan Turner at the free throw line. Once I stunt and get back, now I can affect the lob. But I\'m also putting myself in rebounding position, and we\'re off to the races.*\n\nSmart players have figured out Green plays possum for the pass. In the second round, James Harden stopped throwing it, and attacked Green at the rim. Green didn\'t mind.\n\n&gt;*You could tell as the series went on, James threw the lob out of his repertoire. If that guy continues to drive, I\'m going to meet him at the rim. Every now and then I\'m going to get dunked on. I don\'t care. I think I affect way more shots than I get dunked on.*\n\n- - - \n\n(Plays 3-7 are all interesting, and I highly recommend reading the article, but plays 8 and 9 are particularly fun, so I\'ll quote them here)\n\n- - - \n\n**Play No. 8: Draymond vs Harden**\n\n[Video](https://media.video-cdn.espn.com/gifs/mp4/One_on_On_with_Harden_2gif.mp4)\n\nWhat a visual: two stars as mirror images -- crouched to the same height, leaning forward nose-to-nose, lead feet (James Harden\'s left, Green\'s right) almost touching toes.\n\n[PIC](https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2019/0530/HARDEN.PNG)\n\nMost guys who press Harden end up staring at the back of his jersey.\n\n&gt;*I\'m giving him his right hand. If he wants to take off right, I already have a head start to get on his hip. Not necessarily that I\'m gonna cut him off, but I can force a tougher shot. Because I\'m giving him that lane, I can press up more. If he\'s going to drive, I know exactly where.*\n\n&gt;*I\'m also trusting the help. I know if he does get by me, I have to make the next rotation.*\n\n&gt;*I\'m just taking stabs at his dribble. James and several other guys in the NBA -- they use their dribble to get rhythm. James really uses his dribble for rhythm. I\'m just trying to keep him off balance. Steve [Kerr] always talks about controlling the point -- a tennis analogy. You want to be the person charging the net, not the person on his heels.*\n\n&gt;*When James Harden has the ball, I don\'t care who you are, you\'re at a disadvantage. He is that good with the ball. So what can I do to try to give myself an advantage? I try to force him one way and I play the step-back. I know he\'s trying to get to the step-back. If I\'m two steps off him, I\'m at his mercy.

Golden State destroyed the Rockets with this Curry-Green pick-and-roll on the right side. P.J. Tucker blitzed Curry, and for most of the fourth quarter, Green responded by slipping open toward the paint, taking a pass from Curry, and rampaging into his trademark 4-on-3s for floaters, layups, and lobs to Looney.\n\nWatching from afar, it seemed as if all that rim-running set up this dagger. At a pivotal moment, Green stopped short. He seemed to know Tucker would again lunge at Curry and then scramble back toward the paint, and that if he hit the brakes for a handoff, Tucker would not be able to reverse momentum in time to contest Curry\'s 3-pointer.\n\n&gt;*I can\'t remember if it was him [Curry] that said ""hand back"" or me that said ""hand back,"" but one of us said, \'Yo, the hand back is about to be open."" We\'ve been playing together for seven years now. We got chemistry. We don\'t need a stoppage in play to get a signal to each other. You can\'t make that up -- the big moments and big experiences.*\n\n&gt;*The last three or four plays, I\'ve rolled out of this into the paint. So I know, once I catch [Curry\'s pass], P.J. is going to retreat the paint. And once he takes one step, he\'s dead. Steph\'s release is that fast.*\n\n&gt;*Even if Capela takes me and P.J. tries to crack back and take Looney, his first step has to go toward the paint. And if he takes one step, he\'s dead. And we had beaten them so much going to the hole, I know he\'s taking that step.*\n\nWas Green surprised Houston didn\'t switch more?\n\n&gt;*I was surprised. But Steph had it going. If they do switch, I\'m taking Steph in that matchup. P.J.\'s a great defender, but I\'m taking Steph 10 times out of 10.*', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was after game 1 of the 2019 NBA Finals, Lowe met up with Draymond to ask him to talk him through some (mainly defensive) plays that happened earlier in the postseason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26833111/what-draymond-sees-warriors-star-details-unique-game""&gt;https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26833111/what-draymond-sees-warriors-star-details-unique-game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I quoted some interesting parts I found interesting below:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play No. 1: Dray and Klay vs CP3 and Capela&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://media.video-cdn.espn.com/gifs/mp4/dm_190524_PROG_NBA_WCRD2_G1_Rockets_v_Warriors_BKNK_1063_4_28_2019_ARCHIVE_2gif.mp4""&gt;Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It looks so simple -- Klay Thompson and Green negotiating a standard pick-and-roll. But Clint Capela&amp;#39;s screen drills Thompson. Chris Paul comes open on the other side. Green slides toward Paul, and appears ready to switch onto him. And then, bam: Thompson recovers, Green slides back to Capela, and a window that opened wide for a split second is slammed shut.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How did Green know not to switch? How did Thompson know what Green would do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris is always going to be a pass-first player. He&amp;#39;s coming off to his left hand. I know he&amp;#39;s not comfortable coming off to his left hand. The chances of him just firing are slim.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I know when we&amp;#39;ve been switching, they&amp;#39;ve made it a point to try to hit Capela on the dive. If Klay gets nailed like that and I jump to switch, there&amp;#39;s no way Klay gets back to affect that pass to Capela.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And I know -- Klay is a ball hawk. If he doesn&amp;#39;t hear &amp;quot;switch,&amp;quot; he&amp;#39;s going to chase the ball.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look at Green&amp;#39;s feet as Paul sizes him up: &lt;a href=""https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2019/0530/DRAYFEET.PNG""&gt;PIC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His left foot is directly in front of his right foot; his hips are wide open. That&amp;#39;s a little unusual -- some coaches would say dangerous -- and Green does it a lot. Why? It&amp;#39;s about weight distribution and recovery speed. Green can plant on that left foot, convince Paul he is moving forward, and push off that same foot to begin his retreat to Capela.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If my left foot is up, it&amp;#39;s going to tell [Paul] I&amp;#39;m coming to him. If my feet are parallel to half court, there&amp;#39;s no way I can drop back at the rate I need to. I&amp;#39;m back on my heels that way. I can&amp;#39;t jump. The only other way I can get back to [Capela] that way is to turn and sprint, which takes another second. If I&amp;#39;ve got one foot up, I can play a cat-and-mouse game with the ball-handler and the roller. For a split second, it allows me to guard two people even though I&amp;#39;m not all the way up to the 3-point line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My uncle [Bennie Baber, Green&amp;#39;s coach during elementary school] taught me to play defense with one foot in front of the other. You have to be careful of giving somebody a lane. But my mindset on that is different: If I open my hips like that and I give you that way, I know you&amp;#39;re going that way and I can react better.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You&amp;#39;re taught to send some guys to their weak hand. But one thing I&amp;#39;ve figured out -- some guys, I like to send to their strong hand, because I know exactly what you&amp;#39;re gonna do. That gives me a better chance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I try to send you to your weak hand, chances are you&amp;#39;re a great player -- if I&amp;#39;m worried which hand I&amp;#39;m gonna send you to, you&amp;#39;ve made a living out of still getting to that strong hand. So now I&amp;#39;m guessing what you&amp;#39;re gonna do as opposed to knowing, &amp;quot;OK, I know he&amp;#39;s going this way.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play No. 2: Draymond messing with CJ McCollum and Evan Turner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://media.video-cdn.espn.com/gifs/mp4/dm_190524_PROG_NBA_WCF_G2_Trial_Blazers_v_Warriors_BKNQ_421_ERD1_5_16_2019_DCIO_2gif.mp4""&gt;Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How is Green, like, everywhere before the Blazers expect him?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m at the free throw line analyzing the entire possession. I know it&amp;#39;s CJ [McCollum] coming off, so it has to be a blitz. At that point, it&amp;#39;s really Klay&amp;#39;s rotation [to Meyers Leonard at the rim]. He&amp;#39;s the low man.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2019/0530/KLAY.PNG""&gt;PIC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But Klay is guarding Damian Lillard. So we&amp;#39;d rather not have Klay go help. If he does, we&amp;#39;re leaving a 2-on-1 on the weak side with Dame and Seth [Curry]. We don&amp;#39;t want that. I&amp;#39;m guarding the non-shooter, so I&amp;#39;m the help man.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before Green slides to Leonard, he takes a half-step in McCollum&amp;#39;s direction. The pass to Leonard appears open.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CJ has Andre [Iguodala] and [Kevon Looney] on him. CJ&amp;#39;s 6-3? The likelihood of him seeing that pass and actually getting it through is slim to none.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then comes perhaps Green&amp;#39;s hallmark defensive play: winning a one-on-two situation by stunting at Evan Turner, and baiting Turner into a lob pass. Green is already on his way back to tip that pass before Turner releases the ball.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am going to force Evan Turner to hit this shot from the foul line. Chances are, he probably won&amp;#39;t even take it. What I can&amp;#39;t give up is the automatic two with the lob. I stunt at him to make him think I&amp;#39;m coming, but I&amp;#39;m never going to Evan Turner at the free throw line. Once I stunt and get back, now I can affect the lob. But I&amp;#39;m also putting myself in rebounding position, and we&amp;#39;re off to the races.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Smart players have figured out Green plays possum for the pass. In the second round, James Harden stopped throwing it, and attacked Green at the rim. Green didn&amp;#39;t mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You could tell as the series went on, James threw the lob out of his repertoire. If that guy continues to drive, I&amp;#39;m going to meet him at the rim. Every now and then I&amp;#39;m going to get dunked on. I don&amp;#39;t care. I think I affect way more shots than I get dunked on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Plays 3-7 are all interesting, and I highly recommend reading the article, but plays 8 and 9 are particularly fun, so I&amp;#39;ll quote them here)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play No. 8: Draymond vs Harden&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://media.video-cdn.espn.com/gifs/mp4/One_on_On_with_Harden_2gif.mp4""&gt;Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What a visual: two stars as mirror images -- crouched to the same height, leaning forward nose-to-nose, lead feet (James Harden&amp;#39;s left, Green&amp;#39;s right) almost touching toes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2019/0530/HARDEN.PNG""&gt;PIC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most guys who press Harden end up staring at the back of his jersey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m giving him his right hand. If he wants to take off right, I already have a head start to get on his hip. Not necessarily that I&amp;#39;m gonna cut him off, but I can force a tougher shot. Because I&amp;#39;m giving him that lane, I can press up more. If he&amp;#39;s going to drive, I know exactly where.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m also trusting the help. I know if he does get by me, I have to make the next rotation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m just taking stabs at his dribble. James and several other guys in the NBA -- they use their dribble to get rhythm. James really uses his dribble for rhythm. I&amp;#39;m just trying to keep him off balance. Steve [Kerr] always talks about controlling the point -- a tennis analogy. You want to be the person charging the net, not the person on his heels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When James Harden has the ball, I don&amp;#39;t care who you are, you&amp;#39;re at a disadvantage. He is that good with the ball. So what can I do to try to give myself an advantage? I try to force him one way and I play the step-back. I know he&amp;#39;s trying to get to the step-back. If I&amp;#39;m two steps off him, I&amp;#39;m at his mercy. I jump out to get a contest, and it&amp;#39;s more than likely going to end up a foul.

First off, I’m not arguing who was the better player. AI deservedly won MVP in 2001 for leading the Sixers to the best record in the East, while also leading the league in both points and scoring. Unlike IT, Iverson is also not a complete defensive liability and has had a decade of dominance in the NBA (although IT did get 5th place in MVP voting in 2017 while being the worst defender in the league). I’m not asking who is the better offensive player in the playoffs. Iverson led the Sixers to the finals in 2001 on 30+ ppg, taking a game from the seemingly unstoppable Lakers while IT played through his hip injury to bring the Celtics to the ECF.

My question is who had the better offensive regular season. Contrary to popular opinion, I personally believe that Isaiah Thomas had a better offensive season, but I’ll post some stats to spur up some discussion.

Comparing both players’ per game stat lines, Iverson edges Thomas in points, rebounds, steals and blocks per game. However, because AI played so many minutes, IT actually scored more points per 36 minutes. The pace argument for Iverson doesn’t work here because IT scored more points per possession as well. While AI led the league in points per game in 2001, Isaiah Thomas was 3rd in points per game after the rivalry of MVP Westbrook and Point Harden. In fact, IT4 was second only to Westbrook in points per possession.

What’s even more impressive for Isaiah Thomas is that he scored so highly on 62.5% TS. In fact, the [only other guard to have a 28 ppg season on over 60% TS](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;type=per_game&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;per_poss_base=100&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=0&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;c1stat=ts_pct&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=0.62&amp;c2stat=pts_per_g&amp;c2comp=gt&amp;c2val=28&amp;order_by=ws) (cherry picked I know) is unanimous MVP Stephen Curry in 2016. Iverson’s lower efficiency could be argued because of different pace and defense rules back then, but even compared to league average, IT’s efficiency is insane. For reference, average TS in 2001 was 51.7% and in 2017 was 55.3%.

During the 2001 season, Iverson was known to be one of the clutchest and smoothest offensive players in the league. His iso-heavy playstyle was borderline unstoppable, as he all but perfected the crossover. Iverson led the league in 4th quarter scoring with 7.5 points per game.  Similarly, 5 foot 9 IT4 was known as the King of the Fourth Quarter, scoring 9.8 ppg in the 4th quarter (second only to Russell Westbrook). Both players led their teams to the first seed in the Eastern conference.

Here are some advanced stats for both players for more information in this discussion. More holistic advanced stats were not available for the 2001 season.

I personally think that Isaiah Thomas had a better offensive regular season in 2017 than Iverson in 2001. It is important to also note that the eye test is important for evaluating offensive talent in addition to just stats. Of course, AI is the better player based on longevity and defense alone, but I would like to hear your thoughts.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,80630,public,self,Who had the better offensive regular season? 2000-2001 Allen Iverson or 2016-2017 Isaiah Thomas?,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/fsk10x/who_had_the_better_offensive_regular_season/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is not a lot game tape on Wilt or Russell but I always found it odd why he didn't win more outside his 2 titles. Mister 50ppg took many losses and many of them were due to his mental state and approach to the game. In a vacuum Im taking him over russell. That's if we just read a stat sheet. Reading long articles, and going back into those days, the culture, and the air around that time, has made certain that Wilt can't ever be my GOAT. He is by far, greatly more talented than Russell in offensive, and dare I say defensive ability. He couldn't get it done in the team environment and the NBA of his time though. Why is that? There is very little that separates any GOAT Candidates, and it mostly gets reduced to mental intangibles and their approach to the game and habits of building skills to overcome their weaknesses. There is not much that Separates Shaq and Jordan in my eyes aside from genetic biology. We need to start from the basics though. I'm considering the NBA super athlete. Not the JJ redicks and Robert Horrys. Im talking only about The Shaqs, Jordans, Lebrons, Iversons, Westbrooks, Dwight Howards, Wilkins, Kareems, Wilts, Carters, super athletes that already have the genetic requirements and athleticism to be GOATs. So lets not go off any tangents about Mario Ellie or Steve Kerr or any of that. We can recognize that top tier athletes are all together in a vacuum. They all got different results though.  


Wilt isn't my GOAT because his gaudy numbers never translated. What gets. He performed worse in the playoffs than he did in the regular season. My GOAT increased his performance, and did not shrink.  


Over 10 seasons, they played 142 games against each other with Russell winning 85 and Chamberlain 57.  


Russell made his TEAMS better, Wilt rarely did so.  


Russell was a much better ALL-AROUND player, Wilt was an incredible scoring machine and an awesome rebounder but not all that impressive at the other things a player needed to do to get his teams to WIN games (yes, Wilt did concentrate on assists one year because his coach browbeat him into it - and actually won a championship that year).  


At first glance, Wilt seems to be the far superior player. Comparing career stats, Russell averaged 15.1 ppg, 22.5 rpg, and 4.3 apg on 44.0% FG. Comparing that to Wilts career stats of 30.1 ppg, 22.9 rpg, and 4.4 apg and it doesn’t look close. However, context is key.  


Here’s an excerpt from Hondo, a book written by John Havlicek “Wilt’s greatest idiosyncracy was never fouling out. He had never fouled out of a high school, college or professional game and was determined to keep it intact. When he got that fourth foul his game would change.” Wilt was never quite the dominant defensive player like Russell but a lot of people believe that if they actually counted blocks back then, Wilt would’ve been almost by accident.  


Someone FROM THAT TIME, that PLAYED during that time and was not just a talking head. Humans are not perfect and their might be bias, but on this subject, who else is there to turn to? Can you get me a better source? That'd be hard to come by. Wilt never fouled out of a game, and he was proud of that. When he got 4 or 5 fouls, he'd lay off. You understand what that means for in game dynamics?  


Malcolm Gladwell pointed to this in his podcast Revisionist History where he talks about the aforementioned 100 point game and how the fact that Wilt, a career 51% shooter from the free throw line, managed to go 22/24 from the free throw line shooting free throws underhanded. By 1963–64 however, Wilt went back to shooting free throws the regular way, afraid of being characterized as a “sissy”.  


So we have pretty solid and not proven to be liar, descriptions. Wilt would never foul out of a game. He might rather lose than get number 6. Once he got to 4, 5 fouls, you know the pressure is off. The other team knows that too. So who is at a disadvantage? this isn't a talent question. This is a direct mental game approach situation. the logic behind it is ""I am Wilt. I will not foul out. I will never foul out."" Win or lose, NOT fouling out is more important. They knew that and they could attack accordingly. That DOES NOT show up in his stat sheet. It does show up in his propensity to not win the big series more than I believe he should have though when knowing this context.  


He constantly feuded with almost all of his coaches (famously Dolph Schayes in ‘65) and his hall of fame teammates like Elgin Baylor in ’69. He constantly felt like he should be treated differently than his teammates (there were even reports that he was traveling separately from the team). Even in ’67 when he was trying to get his teammates involved, Bill Libby in 1977 wrote in Goliath (Wilt’s autobiography) “A couple of times he went to teammates with a hot hand and told him he was going to give him the ball exclusively because the other guys were wasting his passes and he wouldn’t win the assists title this way.”  


Are you paying attention. Wilt not winning more is in my POV entirely under his control. This is not me quoting Stephen A Smith, Bill Simmons, Shannon Sharpe, Skip Bayless or those writers at ESPN or the Ringer like Zack lowe or something. I'm going back. I'm going to the ACTUAL participants. The AIR of that time to understand. I don't care about stat sheets and percentages now. This is the context. This is how HE was playing, is HOW his peers and opponents that beat him say he was playing. I hope you are keeping up now.  


Wilt Can't be my GOAT after what I've learned. the Paul Bunyan shit is cool but I'm into the deep layer shit. The mantle BENEATH the litosphere and asthenosphere. There is SO MUCH to understanding basketball than what is presented. It's a travesty how information is presented. Some folks go back just a tad bit and try to rework things with their little bitty stats and new gauges and new tools, but they aren't deep layer. You gotta get deep. Maybe you learned something new about Wilt today.  


He'd rather shoot freethrows and brick than look like a 'sissy' and win. In his 100 point game when he switched to ""Sissy"" style, guess what, Wilt shot 28/32 from the FT line. You read that right. You know who else didn't want to be a 'sissy' underhander? Shaq. He was too cool for that. Shaq on why he would never shoot, or ATTEMPT an underhanded style to improve his just over 50% make rate at the charity stripe:📷[ **https://clutchpoints.com/ .. han-underhand/**](http://itsbx.com/redirect/?url=https://clutchpoints.com/shaquille-oneal-told-rick-barry-rather-shoot-0-percent-than-underhand/)  


""Shaquille O’Neal: Because it’s boring.  


Business Insider: But it’s been proven to be somewhat effective.  


O’Neal: No, it’s not. It’s not proven. Just ’cause a couple guys did it doesn’t mean anybody can do it. I told Rick Barry I’d rather shoot 0% than shoot underhand. I’m too cool for that.  


Did you read that man? I'm too cool for that......hmmm... So was it his big hands that limited him on free throws or him being too cool? The excuse for big guys missing all the time is ""Their hands are so big, its genetic, look man they have no chance.""  


You still believe that shit? That's source shit. Matrix shit. Get out of the farm and open your eyes shit.  


Let's leave it here for why Wilt isn't my GOAT. But these mentalities and results I've shown is the start to understanding why Mister 37PPG Rookie year in the league, Mister 44 ppg, Mister 50PPG Wilt the God and Stilt Chamberlain didn't win more than I believe he should have. No genetic or athletic limitation. Brain shit. Game approach shit. That's on him. Not Russell and his celtics or anybody else. Numbers and fancy stat sheets don't show this shit. Without Shaq being mister too cool for sissy underhand free throws, we'd have more plausible deniability as to why he was so terrible at them. Should have kept his mouth shut, because now I have evidence as to why Shaq COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER with his own words as well. Punk status.  


And here's more this mental approach:"" It’s not a problem, per se, to combine the packages of Chandler and Rondo; such passing can still be additive when surrounded by offensive weapons like West and Gail Goodrich. Additionally, Wilt’s offensive rebounding helped too. But he became fixated on setting the field goal percentage record and at the end of the 1973 season would pass up easy shots to preserve his shooting numbers.  


“March 28, 1973, Chamberlain didn’t attempt a shot or take a single free throw while playing 46 minutes in an 85-84 loss to Milwaukee. Coach Bill Sharman, when asked why Wilt didn’t shoot, said, ‘I don’t know why. You will have to ask him. That really hurt, him not shooting’ -St. Petersburg Times, March 29, 1973  


“Wilt Chamberlain, who entered the game with 24 successful field goal attempts in a row, kept the streak alive in an unconventional fashion. He took no shots at all” – The Milwaukee Journal, March 28, 1973”  


You see the records, but you don't see the deep layer shit like this.  


Wilt can't be the GOAT. He can be top 10 for the record book stuff but not close to the GOAT. Lebron is mentally close to him and his approach. There are a lot of similarities for excuses given by wilt fans and lebron fans. Both top 10 but in the back half for me.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,80629,public,self,I Cannot Justify Putting Wilt In My Top 5.

Jacque Vaughn is the interim. But Durant and Kyrie reportedly want a “big name”. Some of the names we’ve heard are Tom Thibodeau, the Van Gundy Brothers, Ty Lue, and even Gregg Popovich. 

The Nets should have Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving back next season. Caris Levert, Jarrett Allen, and Spencer Dinwiddie have shown some growth and figure to play some sort of role on the team, but could also be used as trade pieces. Joe Harris has been a go-to spot up threat for the Nets, but will be an unrestricted free agent this summer, so it’s unknown if he will be back. DeAndre Jordan was a consolation prize along with Durant and Irving, but has had an up and down year all season long. 

When we do eventually get basketball back, and the Nets bring in a coach, it’s going to probably be a big name. They’re not only chasing championships, but the stars clearly want a big name as well. Question is, who fits the best in your opinion?

""High IQ"" is a term that gets thrown around a lot in sports but sometimes it's hard to actually figure out the point where it matters. For example, there are plenty of things that you are supposed to do that coaches point out at pretty much any level of basketball, the difference is whether you can physically do them or not. Then there are things that very few players are aware of, or angles they can't see, or tricks to create a ""common sense"" chance when there isn't one.


What prompted this was a ""High IQ"" compilation. [Video linked here](https://youtu.be/K6F_wM273W0). To be honest I did not see several of these players as extremely ""high IQ"". That isn't to say that they're not impressive, but there's a difference between a cool play and a smart play.


Here's an example of a couple plays from that video which I think are high IQ vs things that imo should be relatively common sense. Again, I'm gonna sound like a jerk but these are impressive plays.


- Missed FT rebounds is really common and I don't think they should count. It's hard to pull off but players attempt this all the time. It's present in every level of timed basketball. I don't think it's especially smart just because it worked, it's a common sense thing to do when you're so low on time. I think some of these examples count as gutsy, like Fox doing it with over 4 seconds on the clock, but is it really high IQ? It's mostly just luck.


- 0:15 WCS gets a block and throws it off the guy out of bounds. Cool, great athleticism, but again not ""Highest IQ"" in my mind. Players don't do this as often as they should but it's still not a rare idea. Another example in this video has LeBron falling out of bounds so he throws it off someone. This happens pretty often, and unlike the FT miss, it even has a decent success rate.


- 0:28 Another play that's hard to pull off but not necessarily super smart. I don't really know why Doris in the commentary seems to be overselling this play by wondering how he knows to touch-pass to AD when touch passes aren't exceptionally rare and LeBron's looking right at AD as he's jumping.

- 1:07 This is the best example of ""High IQ"" in the video. CP3 gets his team a free point by realizing someone has their jersey untucked. How many other players notice stuff like that? Not to mention it's a huge basket that eventually leads them to a buzzer beater to tie it. This is a completely unique play that very few players could think of.


- 2:30 This is also a good example to me. Avery Bradley fakes tying his shoe to bait the pass. This is a neat little trick that not a ton of players do. Hell, this is something you're discouraged to do because if he doesnt pick off the pass, his man has an open lane with an open corner 3 if help comes.

- 2:48 This is just a fake handoff that the Celtics guarded poorly. I guess you could argue it takes high IQ to read the defense like that but it's not that rare to do. It's just most guys don't have the explosiveness of Simmons and the defense giving them an acre of free space. Blake Griffin does the fake handoff like 3 times a game lol.


- 3:40 This is one of several LeBron no-looks. And while no-look passes aren't really rare, I think him overselling the fake is what makes it high IQ. His exaggeration actually does open up the play and it's a smart idea. Luka does a ball fake on another play and it's the same concept.


- 4:25 I honestly think this one is just Cousins being dumb rather than Rondo being really smart. You're up 3 with under 2 seconds to go, did his coach not tell him to sell out at the 3 point line? Atlanta's only alternative is to get a layup, then either steal and score or foul on the Kings' inbound and then cross the length of the court to tie, all in a grand total of 1.9 seconds. As a player you should probably realize that instead of doing that. I guess the high IQ part is Rondo telling him to guard the empty corner but there isn't really anywhere else to go, they half the top of the arc well covered.


- 5:53 This is just the defense not matching up and the offense pushing the ball. I guess the IQ part is LeBron telling his guy to hurry up and inbound put pushing the ball against a poorly set defense isn't a novel idea. It's more on the Pelicans for having a brain aneurysm on defense.


- 8:22 This checks the box to me. It's kinda like the Lebron touch pass to AD but behind the back to Chandler is what sells it for me.



This wound up being more of a critique of the video but I'm curious to know whether I'm just being a stickler or if people feel the same way. I don't think a lot of these are things nobody would ever think of, just stuff that is hard to do. And that makes it a highlight but not a ""highest IQ"" play. And I'm curious to know if other people think that some stuff (like throwing the ball off someone when going OoB) is actually common sense or not.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,80610,public,self,Common sense vs. high basketball IQ,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/fryqc3/common_sense_vs_high_basketball_iq/,some_ads,7,,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'owrKya3y3QkDfawdL8PBrEi8zPgy17xNJtkuXs9_Hyo', 'resolutions': [{'height': 81, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/RoynIxPaDBWDYIl31YWMbSYxmN_vAM5IdwWFo5C2PAI.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0dcd920f83c849ee8e833d9b94995a9d561ae8a', 'width': 108}, {'height': 162, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/RoynIxPaDBWDYIl31YWMbSYxmN_vAM5IdwWFo5C2PAI.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1838630d873e61ca2a047d0a989a7732ee2ec38', 'width': 216}, {'height': 240, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/RoynIxPaDBWDYIl31YWMbSYxmN_vAM5IdwWFo5C2PAI.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be4510297704909e09840c063c4f7301256689cc', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/RoynIxPaDBWDYIl31YWMbSYxmN_vAM5IdwWFo5C2PAI.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=edc4dbe132ebcc9abc9ed0ae247c678d1f6d6213', 'width': 480}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

No surprises that Jordan wins pretty convincingly on the peak season, and (maybe surprisingly) even more convincingly on 3-year peaks and best 5 seasons (a lot of players had poor seasons in the middle of some greater ones so for the last category I thought it'd be interesting to not have to have all 5 seasons concurrent). 

&amp;#x200B;

Predictably, Shaq moves up a spot on the list every time you restrict the length of time you're measuring, while LeBron suffers a little (still top 3 all-time peak in every category, mind), and Kareem suffers a lot (relative to his career goat status). Like the original career list, this one would argue that Garnett is slept on all-time, and when you shorten the time spans it would also argue that Robinson and West are as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Other surprises (for me) include Wade edging out Kobe for the last 1-season spot (Kobe and Nash were tied right beneath him on 18.5% for their peak seasons), and some of the gaps between players/'tiers' - largely moving one spot is a matter of 1% or a fraction of a %, but Jordan tops all three spans by an average of 3.7%(!), while there's another big 2% drop-off between Bron and Russel for #2-&gt;#3 on the 5-year average, and a similar drop-off from the top 3 peaks of Jordan/Bron/Shaq to Hakeem. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think about how this shakes out when you rank the players by these restricted time-spans? Does it chime with how you see single-season and 3-years peaks and the half-decade 'primes' of these all-timers?

* [Harden](https://men.wikifeet.com/james_harden#&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=2936128) and [LeBron](https://men.wikifeet.com/LeBron_James#&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=2925259) have the lowest rated feet among active players. Not hard to see why. 

* [Lonzo Ball](https://men.wikifeet.com/lonzo_ball#&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=3158713)'s feet are far and away the most popular. His feet have received 63 votes. [Curry](https://men.wikifeet.com/stephen_curry#&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=2923494) (53), [Blake Griffin](https://men.wikifeet.com/blake_griffin#&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=4126035) (49), [K.

* Keen observers will have realized by now that shorter players receive higher feet ratings on average. [This scatter chart](https://imgur.com/NS877in), which includes a few Hall of Famers I could find on Wikifeet, shows exactly that. Chris Paul, a notorious short player, bucks the trend. His [feet](https://men.wikifeet.com/chris_paul#&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=3903584) are rated at 3.38.

I’m planning to write my own deep dive on a certain maligned(at least in certain circles of the fanbase) Hornets guard, but at the moment that piece is basically just a whole bunch of film. 

I want to find a way to appeal to the more “casual” fans because it’s ultimately those guys that constantly talk shit about this certain player.

I would enjoy receiving input.

I feel like in the past few years, the addition of a new game mode in 2K hasn’t been there. When was the last time we got a truly new game mode? I don’t even know! I’ll stop my jabbering and get to the point already.

Remember in NBA 2K14, LeBron: Path to Greatness? It was essential a mode allowing you to try and replicate LeBron’s performances in career defining games and make career defining decisions. A mode like this has been absent since that year. My idea?

2K, get back in your shit and give us something great. Take NBA legends and today’s greats and give us the option to start their careers from the beginning. I’m talking MJ, Larry, Magic, Dr. J, Kobe, Shaq... Even guys like Dominique, J-Kidd, Pippen, Ewing (not that they were slouches or anything). And then of course the greats of today with obvious choices like LeBron, Steph, KD, Russ... Allow us to take over 10-20 to dare I even say 30 moments for the GOATs. Let us make those career defining decisions. I would play THE SHIT out of that if you guys pulled it off the right way. No VC or DLC. Cut the crap.

I get it. It’s a lot of work, but let’s be honest, the graphics right now aren’t probably gonna get much better anytime soon. Regardless of what you do with MyCareer it’s gonna be corny and cringey. But personally, I think this mode could be a savior for the true fans of the franchise and of the NBA in general.

The 8th overall pick has shown continuous improvements this season as long as the situation around him has been getting better. 

Collin Sexton in 36 games since the Clarkson trade:

23.3 PTS on 49% FG, 34% 3P on 4.6 3PA and 86% FT.

His shooting splits for a 2nd year guard since the Clarkson trade are very good. Don’t forget he was also snubbed for the rising stars challenge. 

Collin Sexton in 11 games since the coaching change: 

25.5 PTS on 53% FG, 43% 3P on 5.3 3PA and 80% FT and 4.2 AST. 

Collin Sexton stats for the season:

20.8 PTS on 47% FG, 38% 3P on 4 3PA and 85% FT. 

Under JB Bickerstaff, the Cavs improved in wins and Sexton was a major reason for that as he improved his efficiency in that stretch and points scoring. They beat out the Heat, 76ers, Nuggets and Spurs in that stretch. 

The 2nd year guard is already...

3rd in Total PTS and 5th in Total AST

Nevertheless he had his flaws, as does every great business leader, and I have consistently been surprised by how well current commissioner Adam Silver has held his own against David Stern's legacy over the course of the past six years. 

David Stern did a remarkable job of growing the NBA's relationship with corporate sponsors and tv networks, and of broadening the league's global reach, but on some fronts he may have been resistant to change. This didn't really strike me until Adam Silver took the helm and began to freely dismantle certain traditional processes. 

First there was the Donald Sterling fiasco where Silver simply banned one of the league's owners without hesitation. Though the ban was clearly justified, I'm not sure Stern would have been as forthright in his battle against one of the league's owners out of concern for the PR aspect of it. 

Then Silver drastically changed the All-Star break to allow more rest for players. Plus he changed the format for selecting teams for the game itself. 

Recently he went so far as to explore cross conference playoff seeding (right before the Bucks took off and reduced fears of the permanent superiority of the Western Conference), and he explored other schedule changes to possibly reduce regular season games and/or add meaning to the regular season. 

During this current devastating Covid-19 crisis, the NBA was the first major sports league to suspend its season. 

Adam Silver has consistently taken decisive and innovative action to move the league forward. He has not hesitated to disrupt processes. Though it's unfair to David Stern's legacy to say Silver is better, it is fair to say Silver is a new generation leader who is pushing the league to certain heights it may not have been able to reach as easily without him.

Taking this into account, and the fact that owners are often directly or indirectly involved in politics and other social norms of that world, was the coke and crack problem as bad as the reports?  Or were owners and players being told they need to encourage those ideas and spreading them for political and financial gain?

Hey ya’ll - I know we’re all starving for some NBA but figured I’d use this time to break down key biomechanics and moves of specific players. The first one is on Luka Doncic’s step-back jumper that he uses to devastating effect. This is a new segment so please chime in with pain points and possible improvements.

Here’s a table of contents:

\- 0:00 Intro

\- 0:23 The breakdown

\- 3:43 Demonstration

Summary (I'll do my best to describe the film breakdown in words): One of Luka's go-to pet moves is his step-back jumper which he frequently uses to create space and good looks for himself. The first key element of the step-back is about controlling space. Luka knows that defenders - especially bigs who are switched onto him (in the video, the clip is Montrezl Harrell on a switch) - can't give him much cushion because the threat of his jumper. That lack of cushion means less margin of error and Luka can manipulate that to his advantage. To do that (referring back to the clip), he sells a hard drive left by plantarflexing his trail (left) ankle, eye level into the pain, and right shoulder dip. This puts Trez into a reaction position and back onto his heels. Luka then - and this is the key part - loads his right leg completely (de-weighting the left) with ankle dorsiflexion, knee flexion, and hip plus trunk flexion. This eccentric loading creates an elastic recoil effect when Luka pushes off the right leg and creates significant space. As Luka goes into his gather, he pre-tensions his right achilles tendon with staying on the forefoot which allows him to quickly load and jump. Overlying all of this is that Luka does this all in rhythm which further facilitates clean motor (movement) patterns.

For those at work or the hard of hearing, I've transcribed subtitles on YouTube so sound isn't required.

Locks consist of those players such as LeBron James, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant... The players that if they retired today, are basically in for sure or are locks.

Looks Good consists of players such as Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, and Jimmy Butler. They are proven players and have had great careers up to this point, but either are still a little too young or haven’t done quite enough to make it for sure. Regardless, they will probably make the Hall Of Fame.

Finally, Good Potential consists of players such as Luka Doncic, Zion Williamson, and Trae Young. In their first few seasons they’ve been superstars, but they haven’t necessarily stacked up the wins. It’s okay though, because they are still young and have whole careers ahead of them.


According to Basketball Reference, here are what current NBA players HOF odds[HOF odds](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/hof_prob.html) are.

I think the formula is accurate in predicting the Locks, but as for the other two categories it is relatively shaky for me due to a lack of experience and data from other players. After all, the calculator can’t see into the future.

Anyways, this is how I would place the current NBA players who have solid HOF chances.

Locks:
LeBron James
Stephen Curry
Kevin Durant
Chris Paul
Russell Westbrook
James Harden
Carmelo Anthony
Vince Carter
Pau Gasol
Marc Gasol
Dwight Howard
Kyrie Irving
Kevin Love
Blake Griffin
LaMarcus Aldridge
Paul George
Klay Thompson
Kawhi Leonard

Looking Good:
Giannis Antetokounmpo
Jimmy Butler
Damian Lillard
Kyle Lowry
Andre Iguodala
Anthony Davis
Draymond Green
Derrick Rose
Rajon Rondo
Kemba Walker (with some winning seasons in Boston)
Al Horford
DeMar DeRozan
John Wall (If he has at least two more good years)

Good Potential:
Zion Williamson
Luka Donçic
Ja Morant
Devin Booker
Donovan Mitchell
Trae Young
Andre Drummond
Nikola Jokic
Joel Embiid
Ben Simmons
Bradley Beal
Brandon Ingram
Karl-Anthony Towns
D’Angelo Russell
Jayson Tatum
Nikola Jokic

I’ve been a longtime passive NBA fan, but I only seriously started paying attention in the ‘17-‘18 season. 

It seems to me like the Blazers backcourt core of Dame &amp; CJ is widely considered almost like the knockoff brand of the splash brothers - one clear alpha PG that gets his numbers and can shoot from anywhere, and a 2-guard in CJ that knows exactly how to get buckets with the ability to lead the team in Dame’s absence (a role usually more assigned to Dray than it is to Klay when Steph’s out). 

My question then lies as to why CJ is/was never considered for an All-Star bid. Yes there’s a lot of competition, especially next year with the splash brothers coming back, but nobody ever talks about him like they talk about DBook every year, even though their games are almost identical (DBook 22/5.7/3.6 on 44/35/87 v. CJ 18/3.1/3.3 on 45/40/82). DBook’s averages are pretty much only because he averages 2.5 more shots per game than CJ, but CJ still has better accuracy and imo plays better defense, albeit neither play spectacular D. 

I’m not here to say CJ is a better player than DBook or that CJ deserved a bid over DBook. I’m just saying that it feels like just because CJ isn’t especially flashy, young, or a 1st option like DBook, he never gets seriously considered for the All-Star game. 

Am I right in saying this? Maybe I’m just noticing this this year because the Blazers have been underperforming, but I don’t recall a time where people seriously considered CJ for an All-Star bid the way we consider other similar players hard snubs.

John Stockton was born on 26.03.1962. and spent his entire career as a Utah Jazz PG. He has taken the team to the playoffs every season of his career.

But unfortunately, Stockton and Malone failed to take Utah to the very end, they failed to bring down those famous Chicago Bulls in 97th and 98th, the Houston Rockets a few years before, and so on, and so on ... The list just goes on.

And that's a big pity because surely Stockton is one of the best PGs of all time and Malone one of the best PFs. And in my opinion, the two of them together are the best duo ever. Their Pick and Roll was unstoppable.

Stockton himself was simply a genius, the Point Guard any coach could wish for. The man had over 1000 assists a season 7 times, and from 87-88 to 96-97 had over 10 assists per game. He still holds the record for 14.5 assists per game in a single season. In addition, Stockton is, of course, the all-time leader in NBA history with 15806 assists, while the second-placed Jason Kidd has ""only"" 12901, almost 4000 assists less ... A record that will most likely never be reached.

But that's not all, Stockton was known for being a fierce defensive fighter, nimble and bold and often very dirty, often topping everyone's list of the most annoying player you could meet on the court. This is evidenced by the fact that Stockton is the all-time leader in the NBA in the number of steals with 3265 steals.

I made some graphs about it. The [first one](https://i.imgur.com/OTNH2B7.png) shows you how far he really is in the previous two statistics from the other players, the distance is quite large between him and Jason Kidd, and after that from everyone else.

And that was all possible because Stockton played as many as 19 seasons in which he missed only 22 games. 22. There was no rest for him.

The following two graphs that you can see show [assists over time](https://i.imgur.com/ueb00wQ.png) (depending on the number of matches) and [steals over time](https://i.imgur.com/HUdSDXM.png). And if we take away 4 full seasons (328 games), he would still lead in front of Kidd in assists and in steals. In the assists' segment, he would still lead for at least 1,000 assists.

The NABA

North American Basketball Association: a Proposal for the Evolution of Professional Basketball Structures Away from the current NBA

&amp;#x200B;

Contents

1.	Association Structure and Leagues

2.	The Regular Season and Special Events

3.	The Playoffs

4.	Changes to the Game (Rules changes and new Court Dimensions)

5.	Association Parity, Team Ownership, and Financial Structure

6.     End of Season Awards and Arena Pomp

&amp;#x200B;

1. Association Structure

The current NBA’s league and conferences would be dissolved and replaced by 5 interconnected Leagues, interacting both in regular season play, mid-season tournament play, and through end-of-season promotion/relegation. These leagues will all fall under the NABA (North American Basketball Association) organizational umbrella.

The Association will be expanded by 15 teams to a total of 45 teams. The recommended cities are listed below. Preference has been given to cities based on a number of factors, including but not limited to, and in no particular order: size of population, city wealth, geographic parity, representation of North American national diversity, cities with large arenas. These are suggested as follows: 1. Kansas City, 2. Seattle, 3. Mexico City, 4. Los Angeles, 5. Chicago, 6. Newark, 7. San Diego, 8. San Juan (Puerto Rico), 9. Pittsburgh, 10. Las Vegas, 11. Nashville, 12. Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic), 13. Oakland, 14. Vancouver (British Columbia), 15. St. Louis.

Each of the 5 Leagues will consist of 9 teams. 

League composition is solely determined by play, not by geography. The formation of the NABA will occur five years after the adoption of this proposal, and Leagues 1, 2, and 3 will be formed from the current 30 NBA teams based on the regular and post-season performance over these 5 seasons (overall combined total wins) leading up to the adoption of the NABA structure. Thus, the nine teams with the most wins over those five seasons will compose League 1, the next best nine will form League 2, and so forth. The three teams with the fewest overall wins over these five seasons will form League 4 along with the first six of the above listed expansion teams. League 5 will be composed entirely of expansion teams, those listed above numbers 7-15.

In all following seasons, leagues’ team composition will be adjusted according to a promotion/relegation system. That is, teams will be promoted/relegated up or down to adjacent leagues at the end of the regular season based on regular season win totals (which includes World Games and Winter Invitational wins, see below). 

For teams in Leagues 2, 3, and 4 this means that the team within each league with the highest win total will be promoted up to League 1, 2, or 3 (respectively) and the team with the lowest win total will be relegated to League 3, 4, or 5 (respectively). League 1 relegates the team in the league with the lowest win total down to League 2, but has no promotion (as they are the highest League). League 5 promotes the team with highest win total to League 4, but has no relegation (as they are the lowest League).

\[The hope with these changes is to make available to more cities that ever-elusive hometown energy and excitement, currently unavailable to many small- and mid-market NBA teams b/c of the association's lack of segmented hierarchy—bad teams get stuck in decade long losing battles.\]

&amp;#x200B;

2. The Regular Season and Special Events

In place of the current preseason, World Games will be held in 15 major metropolitan areas outside of North America. Each of these cities will host a group of three NABA teams (teams grouped with others from their same League, but chosen by Association on the basis of quality of entertainment). These groups will play a round-robin (3 games total, 2 for each team) in that city over the course of a week and the Association will host accompanying events for fans and amateurs. Note: unlike the present pre-season games in the NBA, wins from these games do count towards the season win-total for purposes of determining playoff seeding and promotion/relegation. 

Following the World Games, the regular season commences. The regular season consists of 76 games. Each team will play each of the other eight teams in their League five times (for a total of 40 games) and each of the 36 teams outside of their league one time (for a total of 36 games). These games will be spread out from mid-October to mid-April, with two one-week breaks after 25 and 50 games played per team. These breaks will be filled by the Winter Classic Invitational (after 25 games) and the All-Star Week Exhibition (after 50 games).

The Winter Mecca Invitational Tournament, held after the 25th game of the regular season, is hosted at Madison Square Garden in New York City from Christmas Day to New Years Eve. 16 teams are invited based entirely on win-total up to this point, without preference given to strength of schedule or League. (Note that this includes World Games wins, so it is possible for a team to have up to 27 wins at this point.) In the case of ties, preference is given by League (1&gt;2…&gt;5), and then to total regular season points-scored. The tournament itself is a four-round, single-elimination bracket, seeded using the same criteria as selection/invitation. Wins in the tournament add to season win-total. The winner of the tournament is given the NABA Winter Classic trophy to host in their home arena until the next year. A tournament MVP is selected by a panel of 45 media members.

The All-Star Week Exhibition, held after the 50th game of the regular season, is hosted in Las Vegas in mid-February. Midnight on Saturday of that week marks the season Trade Deadline. 20 All-Stars are selected to participate in the All-Star Game. These players are selected across leagues. Selection is made using a weighted single-transferable-vote of 25% each to the following groups: a panel of 45 media members, all 45 head coaches, the 45 active NABA players with the highest career total minutes played, and online fan polling. No restrictions in voting are placed based on player-position or League. The All-Star Game Captains are two players among the 20 selected with the most total fan votes. The Captains make live draft selections at the televised mid-season-award banquet held the Friday night before the All-Star Game (held on Saturday). The week leading up to the All-Star Game features five nights of events: Monday, the Rookie Showcase Game; Tuesday, the Celebrity Game and Half-Court Contest (a head-to-head style, first-to-make-a-shot event held using a bracket of 8 players); Wednesday, the Dunk Contest (featuring an 8-player group scored on a 1-100 scale) and Skills Challenge (featuring an 8-player bracket of head-to-head matchups); Thursday, the 3-Point Contest (featuring an 8-player bracket of head-to-head matchups, seeded by season total 3-pointers-made) and the Playmaker Showcase (a new rating-based contest similar to the Dunk Contest, but more theatrical, in which a player has 20 seconds to showcase their handles/footwork/artistry against a defender—selected by the playmaker—and then finish with a shot; this showcase is expected to be accompanied by a music selection and light-show; scoring is 1-100 with 50 points awarded for style/artistry, 30 for difficulty of shot and strength of defense—making the event a kind of competitive dance/duet performance—and 20 all-or-nothing points for whether the shot was made or missed); and Friday, the Mid-Season Awards Banquet (featuring the All-Star Game draft and a series of awards not included in the end-of-season awards; these might include awards such as Playmaker-of-the-Year, Assistant Coach of the Year, Best Dunk of the Season, etc.) and All-Star Game draft; and finally on Saturday, the All-Star Game itself. The Association works in close cooperation with the gambling institutions of Las Vegas to make the whole week a desirable gambling experience for tourists and basketball enthusiasts.

\[The hope with these changes is mostly just to inject more fun and excitement—for both fans and players—into the season schedule. Also, fun nod to historical regular season totals records: a team that plays in the Winter Invitational final will have played 82 games by the end of the regular season.\]

&amp;#x200B;

3. The Playoffs

The Playoffs begin on the weekend after the last game of the regular season (minimum of a 3-day break). The eight teams in League 1 with the highest win-total for the overall season (including World Games and Winter Invitational) play in the playoffs (so all but one L1 team). These teams are seeded in a bracket by win-total with ties broken by the regular season head-to-head series record (so, best of 5). The 1-seed receives a bye in Round 1. The 7- and 8-seeds play an extra best-of-3 play-in series (round 0 or Wild Card Series). Each round after the 7/8 play-in consists of best-of-7 (first to 4 wins) series. The home/away distribution of games, favoring higher seeded teams, are as follow: 2-2-1-1-1. The winner of the 7/8 play-in plays against the 2-seed in Round 1. Thus the equation for the NABA Champion is as follows: \[((1) v (4 v 5)) v ((2 v (7 v 8)) v (3 v 6))\]. 

\[This is fairly straightforward pro/reg stuff. To make the top of League 1 desirable throughout the regular season, I've added the bye. I played around with a truly tiered playoff, but it felt anticlimactic and maybe too much rest time for the high seeds. It would look like this: (((((((7 v 8) v 6) v 5) v 4) v 3) v 2) v 1).\]

&amp;#x200B;

4. Changes to the Game (Court Dimensions and Rules Changes)

The court dimensions are all altered to metric. The basket is now 3 meters above the court surface (a decrease of a little less than 2 inches). The court is 28 meters long (2 feet shorter) and 16 meters wide (2 and half feet wider). The 3-point line is drawn as an 8 meter arc from the center of the hoop (2 and a half feet further), flat at 1 meter from the sideline (i.e. 7 meters at the corner 3 (close to 3 feet further than the current corner 3)). The new lane’s shape mirrors the three point line’s: an arc 4 meters from the enter of the hoop and 3 meters from the hoop at the sides (slightly shorter at the arc), significantly wider at the sides. The distance from the baseline to the backboard is 1.5 meters (about a foot deeper). The restricted circle is drawn 1.5 meters from the center of the hoop, ending on either side 1.5 meters from the baseline (i.e. flush with the backboard). The game ball is 27 centimeters in diameter (0.05 inches smaller). The hoop is 46 cm wide (0.1 inches wider). There is no half court line, but centered on the court is the 4 meter wide jump circle. All court lines are drawn 5 cm wide. All other non-conflicting court dimensions are rounded to the nearest cm of the current NBA court dimension configuration.

The most drastic change to the current rules is the elimination of the game clock. NABA games will be played first-to-100 and win-by-5. 

The shot clock is shortened to 20 seconds with a 10 second reset. 

All free throws are worth the full point value of the foul: so 2 or 3 on a missed shot or 1 on a made shot. Therefor a player never takes more than 1 free throw at a time. Free throws are taken from the top of the arc of the lane.

All jump balls are taken at center court.

Quarters and Halftime are determined by the leading teams score. That is, when the leading team reaches 25, 50, and 75 then the first, second, and third quarters, respectively, end. If no team has managed to achieve a 5 point lead when the leading team’s score reaches 100, then an overtime goes into affect. In overtime, the shot clock is reduced to 18 seconds with a 7-second reset, and a hard elam ending is set at 24 points more than the leading team's total. There is a short break before overtime, and each team is given an extra timeout.

Lane violations only apply to offense (allowed 1 foot in indefinitely, 2 feet for up to 3 seconds; remember here that the lane in the NABA is significantly wider than in the present NBA dimensions).

Each team has 1 Designated Big (indicated by a differently-colored jersey) for whom the offensive lane violation does not apply. When this player is on the bench, the team does not have a Designated Big (i.e. the designation is non-transferable and submitted by each team at the start of regulation: the two DBs face off in the opening jump-ball).

There is no half court violation as there is no half-court line.

Post-foul resets are played from the center court circle (instead of the sideline). On resets, defenders cannot enter the center circle until the ball is passed out (cannot be dribbled out of circle by reset player).

Any made shot in the mid-range (the area between the lane and the three point line) is make-one, take-one. That is, if a player makes a mid-range shot, their team immediately gets the ball back at mid-court.

All other non-conflicting rules are the same as in the present NBA.

\[Though folks may find these changes drastic and strange, I've considered each carefully with the intention of refocusing the strategy of pro basketball around the sport's natural aesthetic strengths—attempting to eliminate painful Harden-esque elements of current gameplay (esp. foul-drawing, clock-management, and strict shot selection) that feel more like algorithmic functions on a court than artful basketball performance. No offense to James Harden, who would still be very good in this system—and probably a hell of a lot more fun to watch.\]

&amp;#x200B;

5. Association Parity, Team Ownership, and Financial Structure

There is no soft or hard salary cap. The only restriction on team-spending is the NABA luxury tax line set by the NABA each off-season based on projected revenue of all teams. For every dollar over the tax line a team spends on player salaries, they must pay the NABA 2 dollars. There is no special repeater tax for teams over the line multiple consecutive seasons, just the 2 dollars on the dollar.

Off-season signings begin 1 week after the NBA Finals.

The minimum player contract is 1% of the tax line (set by the NABA each year). The maximum player contract is 45% of the tax line (available to players who have played in the association for 5 or more years). 

Players receive veteran bonuses as their careers progress. The NABA itself pays veteran bonuses directly to players. Veteran bonuses are equal to 1% of the tax line value per year played (so the only players who receive no veteran bonus are rookies). This income does not count as salary for purposes of determining team tax. 

Similarly, players receive loyalty bonuses from the NABA of 2% of the tax line value for every year they have spent on a team for which they have played for at least 5 seasons (calculated for total seasons played for the team; so, a player entering their fifth season with a team would not receive a loyalty bonus, but a player entering their sixth year with a team would receive a 10% loyalty bonus, increasing by 2% every year following). Again, this income does not count as salary for purposes of determining team tax. 

The cost for veteran and loyalty bonuses is spread among all teams weighted according to teams’ estimated market share of NABA.

Short-term minimum contract length is 10-days pro-rated. All other contracts must be a minimum of 1 year. All contracts must be honored through injury.

The maximum contract length is 10 years. Salaries must be written as percentages of the tax line. All extensions must not make a total contract exceed ten years. Otherwise there are no restrictions on extensions, which (unlike free agency signings) are available to teams/players one year before the end of a current contract.

Player and team options may make up to one half of the total length of a contract, rounded down (for instance, a max-length contract could be a 5+1+3+1 or a 7+3 or a 5+2+1+1+1, etc.), and may be mixed (for instance, in the first of the above examples, the +1 year-six could be a player option, followed by a +3 year team option, followed by another +1 year player option).

Contract salaries may be flat, descending, or ascending year to year but must always be built around a tax-line percentage, not a specific value; so salaries shift according to the association's value.

Player/owner revenue split is set at a minimum 55% to players and maximum 45% to owners. If total team spending on players (including expected bonuses) following off-season signings does not meet the 55% mark then the difference is paid by the teams, split weighted according to team percentage of market share, to the players. This player payout is weighted among players according to total-minutes-played over the course of the past 5 seasons.

Revenue sharing between teams/owners is set at 30% (in addition to any luxury tax paid), determined after veteran and loyalty bonuses are awarded by the league.

There is no draft. Instead, rookies (minimum age of 18 as of the first day of summer signing) may sign contracts with any team they like, beginning one day before all other free agents. However, rookie contract salary maximums are scaled based on a team’s league position following promotion/relegation. These rates are as follows: League 5 20%, L4 15%, L3 10%, L2 5%, L1 1%. Furthermore, rookies minimum contract length for maximum rookie salaries is set at 3 years, maximum length at 5 years. A player may not sign for more than the respective signing team’s league’s rookie max until that player has played at least 5 years in the NABA.

Teams may trade player contracts (only with a player's consent) along with unrestricted cash-considerations. Players on rookie (or under-5th-year-in-league) contracts may only be traded to teams within their own league or lower leagues.

Public player trade demands nullify a player’s end-of-season loyalty bonus.

Teams may only be moved from a city if the greater metropolitan area agrees by 60% majority in a popular vote to allow an owner (or ownership group) to move the team.

\[There's a lot going on here, and much of it would take considerable squirming to make financially feasible; but ultimately the hope with these changes is to balance casual fans' and owners' desire for more in-organization player-personnel consistency w/ ethical valuation of players' craftsmanship/showmanship/market-draw.\]

6. End of Season Awards and Arena Pomp

The season MVP, Rookie of the Year, Coach of the Year, Most Improved Player, and 6th Man of the Year: these are all voted on using a weighted single-transferable-vote (ranked-choice) by media (a 100-member panel), players (all who played in at least 20 games), and coaches (all 45 head coaches at the end of the season);  35%/35%/30%, respectively, weighted to these three groups. A new award, Captain of the Year, goes to a player who showed great on-court leadership and is voted upon using this same method.

The Scoring Champion is selected by points-per-game, but must have played in at least 70 games (combined World, Winter, and Regular Season games) to qualify. 

The General Manager of the Year is selected by a 50/50 weighted STV vote of 100 media members and all 45 team GMs at season’s end. 

The First, Second, and Third All-NABA teams, and the All-Rookie and All-Defense teams (there is only one of each), are chosen by the media without regard to any positional requirements. 

All other awards are same as-is. Across the board, no voting is allowed for players/coaches/GMs within their own organization (for traded players, this applies to all teams they played at least 10 games for this season).

Teams may hang banners for the following: NBA Finals Championships, Regular Season League Championships, Winter Classic Championships, and retired player jerseys.

\[Hope is to make these a little fairer and more representative of the current team structures. No biggie.\]

Thanks to the amazing work of u/robdog1330, who put together these teams (check them out if you can, they're very well-written and researched!), this tournament is possible. Using whatifsports.com, these games can be simulated, and whilst it is not perfect, it at least gives a sense of what these matchups would look like. The website also requires using individual seasons for each player (ie 88-89 Michael Jordan instead of just Michael Jordan) so I chose the highest value season for each player based on the website's salary rankings.

All 30 teams are seeded, with the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers getting byes into the second round, and other teams are seeded on number of championships won. When teams were tied, a randomiser picked who would be seeded at each position. 

Now for the first matchup of the tournament, it is the 3rd Seed [Chicago Bulls](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/co36e6/30_nba_alltime_teams_in_30_days_alltime_chicago/) against the 30th seed [Utah Jazz](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cv92gy/30_nba_alltime_teams_in_30_days_alltime_utah_jazz/).

This was a very intriguing matchup, with a Bulls team led by the familiar faces of Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen once again coming up against John Stockton and Karl Malone of the Utah Jazz, like they did in the 1997 and 1998 NBA Finals. Differentials on the Bulls side such as MVP Derrick Rose, defensive stalwarts in Joakim Noah and Jimmy Butler, and great bigs with Bob Love and Artis Gilmore lead to a very well-rounded team. The Jazz squad also includes volume scorers in Pete Maravich and Adrian Dantley, as well as Rudy Gobert in the paint and Deron Williams and Carlos Boozer off the bench.

Without any further ado, here is how the matches played out.

**Game 1 - Chicago Bulls 108-98 Utah Jazz, Bulls lead series 1-0**

[Boxscore](https://www.whatifsports.com/nba/boxscore.asp?gameid=23243621&amp;teamfee=-1)

Game 1 was a tightly contested match but a brilliant 3rd Quarter from the Bulls pulled away from the Jazz. 10 different Bulls players scored in the 3rd, and the strength in depth showed. Cold games for Karl Malone (8/17) and Andrei Kirilenko (1/7) as well as poor free throw shooting (59% to the Bulls' 86%) contributed to the Jazz's loss.

Once again it was Michael Jordan who put the Jazz down in this one, as he picked up Player of the Game with a Game-High 18 Points as well as 8 Assists and 5 Rebounds on only 1 Turnover. 

**Game 2 - Chicago Bulls 106-86 Utah Jazz, Bulls lead series 2-0**

[Boxscore](https://www.whatifsports.com/nba/boxscore.asp?gameid=23243760&amp;teamfee=-1)

The Bulls once again pulled away in the 3rd, but also won the first two quarters as well. It was Adrian Dantley (4/11) and Gordon Hayward (1/7) who went cold for the Jazz, but Dennis Rodman and Horace Grant grabbed 8 and 9 Rebounds respectively off the bench to add to another Player of the Game performance for Michael Jordan (17 Points, 7 Assists).

**Game 3 - Utah Jazz 119-90 Chicago Bulls, Bulls lead series 2-1**

[Boxscore](https://www.whatifsports.com/nba/boxscore.asp?gameid=23243793&amp;teamfee=-1)

A surprise blowout in Game 3 brings the Utah Jazz a game on their homecourt. Karl Malone leads with 19 Points on 9/12 shooting and the Jazz finally fix their free throw woes, shooting 92% off of 25 shots. 7 Jazz players scored double digits, with much greater efficiency from 3 (53% to 23%) as well as Pippen (1/10), Butler (1/8) and Bob Love (1/6) failed to give Jordan the support he needed.

Rudy Gobert picks up Player of the Game with a 16 Point and 13 Rebound Double-Double, including 5 Offensive Rebounds.

**Game 4 - Utah Jazz 81-94 Chicago Bulls, Bulls lead series 3-1**

[Boxscore](https://www.whatifsports.com/nba/boxscore.asp?gameid=23243813&amp;teamfee=-1)

Utah are held to just 84 Points due to great Bulls defence, as Joakim Noah picks up Player of the Game with 7 Points, 11 Rebounds, 4 Assists, 2 Blocks and 2 Steals. A low-scoring game for both sides saw Chicago shoot 40% from the field and Utah at 35%, including 17% from 3. Jordan registered only 4 Points, with his teammates Artis Gilmore, Jimmy Butler and Norm van Lier scoring double figures.

**Game 5 - Chicago Bulls 102-107 Utah Jazz, Bulls lead series 3-2**

The Jazz save themselves from potential elimination with the closest game of the series so far. Michael Jordan missed a game-tying 3 with just 5 seconds to go, as both sides trades scores down the stretch in the 4th Quarter. Despite Jordan's game-high 25 Points, the Jazz take the win lead by Dantley, Malone and Gobert scoring 17, 16 and 15 Points respectively. 

Adrian Dantley picks up Player of the Game, adding 5 Rebounds, 5 Assists and 3 Steals to his 17 Points.

**Game 6 Utah Jazz 103-116 Chicago Bulls, Bulls WIN series 4-2**

Utah took Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls to 6 games but lost on their home court, as Player of the Game Jordan went 10/13 from the field on 24 Points. Derrick Rose also added 20 Points, having his best game of the series. Darrell Griffith had 19 off the bench for the Jazz but the 30th Seed couldn't overcome the scoring of Chicago, who outscored them 38 to 22 in the 2nd Quarter.

**RESULT - Bulls win series in 6**

This series had ebbs and flows, including the possibility of a late Utah comeback before Michael Jordan had his say and took his team through to the next round. Jordan picked up Player of the Series, whilst Gobert impressed for the Jazz. Chicago's defence proved effective, led by Joakim Noah and Scottie Pippen as well as Jordan, and Utah's best players (such as Karl Malone) often fell short, going through cold streaks like in Game 4.

People always want to rank the TOP 5, TOP 10 or even TOP 15. However, I'd argue that this sweet spot between the 15th and the 30th best player is where it gets interesting, and, what is more important, in this range, you are still capable of making a fixed list without too many players being in the conversation.

Okay, let's move to criteria. It's quite simple, top 15-30 players in the NBA RIGHT NOW. Not only this season, not for the future, but at this point in time, who are the TOP 15-30 BEST, most valuable, basketball players. Offense plays a big role, defense plays a big role. This season obviously also plays a great role here, and you can rely on eye test, raw stats, advanced numbers and even narratives and past playoff performances.

This is the list of players I've come up with, some may be inside the TOP 15, but not necessarily.

20 players in the conversation:
Trae, Morant, CP3, Simmons, Lowry, Kemba, Jrue
Beal, Lavine, Booker, Mitchell, 
Ingram, Jaylen, Middleton
Sabonis, Porzingis, Zion
Gobert, KAT, Adebayo 

This is my go at it:

15. CP3
16. Gobert
17. Beal
18. Adebayo
19. KAT
20. Simmons
21. Middleton
22. Lowry
23. Mitchell
24. Ingram
25. Trae
26. Kemba
27. Booker
28. Sabonis
29. Zion
30. Jaylen

Fell short: Morant, Lavine, Jrue, Porzingis (from my list) 

also the likes of Vucevic, Aldridge, DeRozan, Fox and VanVleet

Who do you think HAS to be in this list? who is borderline top 30?

Although, this weakness limits his offense more than his defense. 

Offensively, his inability to shift laterally and change directions with fluidity will seriously impair his growth as a perimeter player. He lacks the ability to get the basketball and give his opponent a tough time if getting to the paint is not an option. He can't work past his defender using lateral movement and handle, he's just a step too slow and his opponent can easily recover and draw the offensive foul or at least contest the shot. 

It affects his ball handling, as he can't slide and shift back-and-forth very good. It also stunts his ability to create a shot too, as he's terrible at hitting off-balance or contested jumpshots. He never takes stepback jumpers, he can't drive and pull back his dribble due to him lacking the hip mobility and fluidity, and he can dribble his way into a jumpshot. Due to this weakness, it renders him nearly ineffective offensively in late-game situations. 

You can't give him the basketball and tell him to take over a game with his scoring. He simply can't do it. At least not yet. His footwork laterally isn't coordinated and he occasionally gets knocked off balance if his opponent his applying a lot of pressure to his upper body. His lateral footwork appears very heavy-footed and his footsteps are choppy. He's also very, very stiff and just doesn't look confident in his ability and potential as a perimeter player. 

Defensively is where you can notice this weakness this most. In terms of perimeter and on-ball defense, it's very much more of the same in the paragraph above this. Very robotic and choppy footsteps, can't work over screens, and is often beat off the dribble by smaller, quicker guards and fluid, shifty wings. If he can't recover and his assignment is already on their way to the rim, it's almost a guaranteed 2 points on the scoreboard. I've seen big men like Joel Embiid have him flat-footed while he goes to work on him with his dribble. 

A lot of perimeter-oriented superstars will find some sort of postseason success by matching up with their opponent's best player and attempting to shut them out of the game offensively. In order to make consistent late postseason runs, you just have to have the ability to match up with your opposition's best player and try to take them out of the game. And due to Giannis' height and strength, that should be nearly any player. But he just doesn't have that ability and it looks like he won't ever. 

If he can't improve this in a meaningful way, we might be closer to prime Giannis than expected. I just can't find any realistic situation where he improves this drastically. I'm not saying he can't improve, but he's 25 years old and in his 7th season. LeBron early in his career was suffering from the same criticism and critiques Giannis got, but in all honesty, I'd be happy with Giannis becoming the dynamic offensive player mid-2000's LeBron was.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,80440,public,self,Giannis' lateral movement and quickness,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/fo1b16/giannis_lateral_movement_and_quickness/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His strengths are, ironically enough, exactly what the Lakers need this season, and are what will allow him to be increasingly scale-able on better and better teams. He's a legitimate good shooter now (38.3% on 6.5 attempts/game is excellent), his passing/vision is remains fantastic, and he's a complete pest on defense. He has an almost Draymond-esque quality to his game (obviously on a lower level to the veritable DPOY/All-Star) where he'll be a passable player on an average/below-average team, but he'll function as an excellent talent multiplier on better and better teams, with the spacing, ""network connection"" vision, and defense he provides.

Granted, his scoring from literally everywhere else other than the 3 point line and the rim (where he's quite impressive for a guard, converting 62% of his attempts, a Westbrook-esque number) is quite limited - he's surprisingly poor from the midrange and floater range (given his ability from deep) and his free throw shooting is so poor that he regularly avoids contact when getting to the rim - he shoots 57 FT%, which is admittedly an improvement from the 44% he averaged his 1st two seasons. (His shot selection, it must be said, limits these issues somewhat - only 21% of his shots don't come at the rim or from 3.)

Therefore, I don't think he will be able to lead an above average offense largely of his own merit just yet, but when playing alongside other lead ball handlers (say, a Brandon Ingram or a Zion Williamson), he's perfect. The Pelicans have been a legitimately good team since Zion entered the lineup (or prior to that, whenever Favors was on the court, LOL), so I'm glad that more people will start to take more notice of how Lonzo has polished his weaknesses and honed his strengths to the point where he's basically an indispensable part of the Pelicans' starting lineup now.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,80440,public,self,Some stray thoughts on Lonzo Ball,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/fo0a03/some_stray_thoughts_on_lonzo_ball/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And with the decade that went by between both iterations of Bill Simmons’ synopsis of basketball, one man’s career was lost — Carmelo Anthony. Before 2009 - he was one of the 5 best players in basketball and people hoped would finally get the team he deserved. Now, he’s past his prime and establishing himself as a veteran minuteman.


But for a period of time—the post Allen Iverson Denver Nuggets and the early stages of his New York Knicks tenure—it felt like it would finally happen for the Baltimoron. More specifically, it felt like he would finally establish his name as a Western Conference force to be reckoned with in 2009. 

---

Carmelo Anthony knew he wouldn’t have to wait long for his name to be called in 2003. LeBron James was going first overall — everyone knew it — but the landing post of Carmelo Anthony would be intriguing. Fans in Detroit would want Carmelo Anthony with the second overall pick but instead be greeted by Darko Milicic, the Serbian center with the skills to be great but the motivation questions that would haunt his career. The Pistons would shake off the draft bust and wipe their tears with a NBA championship but that’s a different story.


Instead, David Stern would enter onto the stage to rare applause. The Denver fans couldn’t hide their excitement. the totally unbiased New York crowd was ready for their man to be called. With fans chanting ""Darko"" in the background, Stern would call Carmelo’s name. His movement off the hat from forward to backwards back to forwards was a power move. He would attempt to hide his happiness in his first interview, he would say he right things and was ready for the bright lights as a member of the association.


However, he soon realized that lights in the Mile High weren’t that bright. He would have a spectacular rookie season, dragging Denver to the play-offs in the much stronger western conference and would have a quick first round exit. He would also lose ‘Rookie of the Year’ to LeBron. There’s still a population that believes Carmelo got screwed here and I’m one to agree but I digress. He would also give an iconic line of, ""I have strong shoulders"" when referring to him putting his team on his back. First season report: so far so good.


Between 04 to 06, it became more of a development of the management structure. Kroenke was still bringing in his people in the Nuggets organizations, Kiki Vandeweghe was bringing in his guys into the roster—and was then didn’t have his contract renewed which made no sense at all given how well he had done to revitalize the organization. George Karl would become the head coach during the 2004-05 season, who was seen as the man to bring Carmelo to his full potential by not being a coach. Karl’s ‘random basketball’ style, focusing on goals versus systems worked well. 


And that game December 16th happened. One of the more forgotten brawls. It wasn’t a close game, both sides knew it. The Knicks were down double digits within the final minutes and Isiah Thomas wanted the game over with. George Karl, being an asshole and wanting instill confidence in his team, wanted to run up the score. 


JR Smith would get the outlet pass with 1:15 remaining in the game and would drive to the basket for a contest two points. Mardy Collins, taking instruction from his head coach, wouldn’t let JR get the easy bucket and would foul hard. Smith proceeded to tell Mardy that wasn’t smart(y) while being man-handled by Nate Robinson who was doing his best to stop a possible fight. Matters got worst, Carmelo grabbed Nate by the neck, JR and Nate hugged while falling to the floor and Carmelo Anthony threw a straight right and their season would be up in question.


Carmelo and JR would be out of action for 15 and 10 games respectively and the team’s season was up in question. 3-days later, the team would trade for Allen Iverson. It was an incredibly weird week.


The Iverson tenure is a well remembered period of time for fans — as Allen basically made the boys in baby blue cool. It would start the ‘Thuggets' trend. AI would put Denver on SportsCenter and the team would be fun to watch in the regular season. In the post season, they would still experience the same woes. Their two star players never really developed the chemistry you would want from your stars, Carmelo wanted out and more importantly, Iverson’s contract had one year left. They had to decide.


Which brings us to the 2008-09 season. Seattle no longer had the SuperSonics, Josh Childress joined the Euroleague—which was a big deal at the time and Shaq was in Phoenix.


For Denver, it was a confusing time. They would trade way Marcus Camby for payroll purposes but would then make one of the most important decisions—they would trade away ‘The Answer.’ It felt like the team was being set-up for the possibility of a rebuild. Remember, this was slightly before the world realized that AI was no-longer in his prime, he was showing his age. 


Despite bringing on Chauncey Billups in the trade, Billups’ reputation as his role wasn’t necessarily seen as a move to bring success in Denver. That Detroit Pistons line-up we all remember was becoming stale. Media outlets would use that phrase when defining the trade and it was seen as Allen possibly rejuvenating the franchise. Meanwhile, the core of the Pistons line-up was surprised to see that they were being broken up. Billups, on a podcast with Zach Lowe and Rachel Nichols, briefly commented that he didn’t see it coming and thought they were running back once again.


The Nuggets had an out heading into the 2008-09 season. They could trade away Carmelo Anthony, rebuild if they needed to. But they would proceed to have their best season since 1987-88.  *How?*


Billups could shoot from deep. That was always the aspect that never clicked with AI’s game. With an added influence on the offense, opponents would have to react on the defense end. Being able to pull-up, being able to be a catch-and-shoot threat was a nice compliment in a system that would look to get Carmelo Anthony isolation opportunities. Added with another catch-and-shoot threat in JR Smith, coming off of the bench but receiving significant amount of minutes, was huge.


Defensively, the team felt better. What was in actuality, minor statistical improvements from an already solid defensive team, felt like a lot more when matching. Kenyon Martin, Nene, Birdman were great rim presences. Dahntay Jones was useful as a perimeter defender and hard fouls. Denver wouldn’t let you win at the rim — you would have to beat them from deep. They allowed the 4th most three-point attempts and teams would average 44.0% from the field against them. It was a decent trade-off that they never seemed to be punished for. *A Carmelo Anthony team was a good defensive team and people still forget how physical Anthony was a defender.* 


And even with the minor hiccups — Carmelo getting suspended because he didn’t leave the court when George Karl wanted him to, a brief wrist injury — the team was primed to make a run for a championship. It was their best shot yet. 2nd in the west, the Lakers were on the opposite side of the bracket and the San Antonio Spurs would have to wait a round to face the Nuggets, giving breathing room to a team that had been crushed by simply going up against some of the historically best team and players in the post-season.


Seriously, here was Carmelo’s post-season opponents:


04 - Minnesota (Prime Kevin Garnett versus a rookie Carmelo Anthony)
 
05 - Spurs

06- Clippers (I have nothing for this, they should have won the series and this was the wake-up call that Carmelo needed help)

07 - Spurs

08 - Lakers


Their first series was against the New Orleans Hornets. Chris Paul and David West had done enough to drag New Orleans to the play-offs but it was clear that the team would be outmatched. A series that would feature the Nuggets averaging wins by 24 leads, 121 to 63 blowout in Game 4, the Nuggets finally got the monkey off of their back. Lead by Carmelo's 24 points, 6 rebounds, 5 assists, they won a play-off series. As a Washington sports fan, the lack of a first round exit wasn't something I was used to. But when it happened, it felt like anything was possible.


As if the basketball gods were on their side, the Spurs would lose to the Mavericks in round one. Josh Howard stock was at an all-time high, Dirk Nowitzki was doing Dirk Nowitzki things and the lack of Manu would lead to Tony Parker having to score an incredible amount of points for his style. Even with the age of the Spurs team, they were seen as a championship threat and you never wanted to see Pop’s line-up in the play-offs. 


Going against Dallas still would be a contested match-up. Both teams like the possibility of isolation near the post but both had physical isolation defenders with active guards. It was a skill match-up in every sense. 


What we wouldn’t expect in the series were the mistakes from Kidd and Nowitzki — who had a combined 32 turnovers in 5 games. Josh Howard would fall off the face of the earth in the mile high — shooting 1 for 15 from behind the arch. Role players Antoine, Wright, JJ Barea, Brandon Bass wouldn’t provide the output needed. 


And Denver looked great. Carmelo and Chauncey had better chemistry than Ryan Seacrest and Kelly Ripa. Averaging 30 points and 21.6 per game while being able to go 40 minutes a night was huge for the Denver team. Being able to rotate in-and-out role players in the outstanding positions and get meaningful minutes lead to their handwork paying off, especially with JR and Birdman have solid offensive performances. 


And the NBA world was getting excited. The Lakers barely made it by the Rockets, who went without Yao Ming for most of the series. If Yao’s body lasts just this series, its a huge what-if to the history of that post-season. LeBron James was scorching the eastern conference while Orlando had finished up two difficult series. *Were we about to get a Carmelo versus LeBron finals?*


We weren’t. But we did get an entertaining western conference finals.


The Nuggets would start Game 1 hot in Los Angeles. A turnover filled first quarter gave the Nuggets a much needed 8 point lead to start the game. But when the second quarter came, the talent on the Lakers team began to add up. While Kobe would have 10 points on 3 of 8, Gasol, Fisher, Ariza, Bynum, Odom, Walton, Farmer and Powell all had points in the quarter. Even with Melo finishing the first half with 20, K-Mart with 11 and Nene with 14, the Lakers would still have a one-point advantage.

The second half would feature the duel we were expecting — Kobe versus Melo. The fourth quarter would feature the first of many match-ups with the two stars covering each other. However, Carmelo’s physical defense wasn’t being respected by the refs, he would rack up 3 fouls in the 4th quarter. Kobe would get to the line *9 times* in the fourth, including one time with 30.5 seconds to go. A reach-in foul from Kenyon Martin gave the Lakers a 2 point lead. 


But on an in-bounds play, Anthony Carter would throw a lazy lob that was stolen by Trevor Ariza and Carmelo Anthony could be seen mean-mugging the camera man. 39 points, 14 of 20 from the field, 6 rebounds wasn’t enough. Quiet bad games from Chauncey Billups and JR Smith gave the Lakers a one-game lead but everyone knew the series wasn’t over.


Game 2 would feature a slow start from the Nuggets. Carmelo would go 1 for 6 from the field but Kenyon Martin would keep things close with his 10 points. Dahntay Jones would have 4 fouls in the first, JR Smith would have 2 fouls. It felt like an implosion of the team already. But an appearance from Linas Kleiza--whose stats this series was just remarkable-- brought a new spark to the team. Carmelo would become a guard and would score 14 points in the second—getting to the stripe 6 times. Trevor Ariza, who had been guarding Melo incredibly well, was switched out for a Luke Walton, who wasn’t ready for his time on the isolation island. Chauncey would wake-up with a solid 6 points and things were starting to go Denver’s way.


For the second straight game, the 4th quarter would feature Melo and Kobe guarding each other. But this time, the calls were in Carmelo’s favor. Bryant would not see the free-throw line in the 4th quarter and it forced the rest of the Lakers members to take on a burden on the weight as Kobe would have to pass out. The final possession of the game would feature Derek Fisher having to take a contested three-pointer in the corner that would not go and the Nuggets would tie the series. The team that was always questioned for their mental toughness bounced bad on the road.


But in his post-game interview with Doris Burke, she would make the comment of, *“You look like you are hurting.”* He admitted he was. His 34, Chauncey’s 27 felt normal. Linas Kleiza’s 16 wasn’t but it felt right to have the Denver bench back in the picture.


But Carmelo was hurting. 


He would start Game 3 hot—13 points, 3 of 6 from the field and 7 of 8 from the line. Bynum going into foul trouble early and Odom picking up fouls would add some stress to the interior defense of the Lakers. The first half lead was huge because there were questions as to how much you could get out of Melo this game—even if he would play 21 minutes in the first half. The Nuggets would enter the fourth quarter with a 79-71 lead but Kobe’s 13 points in the third quarter would create some nerves. The Black Mamba was coming. 


This time, in the fourth, Carmelo didn’t guard Kobe. Instead, JR Smith did. Carmelo had 4 fouls and had to be careful. Keeping him on Trevor Ariza would allow him to take possessions off without having to be as physical as you would expect him to. JR couldn’t defend Kobe though. Bryant would have 13 points but more importantly, Denver would only score 18 in the 4th. 

With 37.1 seconds left, the game was still interesting. The Lakers had a 2 point lead and the Nuggets would have the ball. Kenyon Martin would take the ball out as George Karl would draft up a play to get JR Smith open in the corner with the option of Melo getting the ball off of a Nene screen. The play should have to Melo getting the ball at the top of the key, Nene setting an off-ball screen for Chauncey Billups—who was still playing out of character, 5 for 15 from the field and 2 of 7 from deep—to take a three.


However, Odom’s long arms forced Martin to adjust his pass. Kenyon wanted Carmelo to extend out of the half-court line—Carmelo didn’t want to do that and wanted Martin to go over the top or lead Carmelo right. The miscommunication would be taken advantage of by, guess who — Trevor Ariza. Melo would have to foul out and all he could do was look down. His 21 points — 12 of which came from the line wasn’t the game the Nuggets needed from him. Unlike Chauncey, he couldn’t go 4 of 13 from the field. Chris Andersen shouldn’t have to score 15, Dahntay Jones shouldn’t have to score 10 points. 


Carmelo was hurting. He was taking a lot of bumps and bruises this series. Before this series, his character was always in question with him trying to be ‘hard’ when everyone thought he was 'soft'. I mean, he did made a guest appearance in a *Ned’s Declassified School Survival Guide* episode—which doesn’t air anymore for some reason. It felt like the world was Rashida Jones in *The Social Network,* saying “[You’re not an asshole, you’re just trying so hard to be.](https://youtu.be/JFeaWHDQzQA?t=129)”


The image Carmelo was attempting to present for his whole career was plaguing him. He was hiding the pain, hiding the struggle, hiding the frustration. 


Game 4, his team would finally bail him out. He would go 3 of 16 from the field and would only score 15 points. But, JR Smith’s 24, Billups’s 24, Lines Kleiza again with 10 was enough. 7 players scoring in double digits was enough to secure a 19-point victory for the Nuggets. Ariza, Bynum and Odom finishing the game with 5 fouls help but more importantly, Carmelo only had to play 35 minutes of basketball. 


But it set the expectation that he had to show up in Game 5. This felt like a must-win. The Nuggets couldn’t win the series on the road, it just wouldn’t happen. They were such a home dominant team in the regular season and the possibility or expectation that the series could be dragged out even longer didn’t bode well with Carmelo’s health.


Carmelo would not be good to start the game but Kobe sucked too. The first half would end even at 56 — thanks to a solid first quarter from Chauncey, a solid second quarter from Carmelo and the depth of the Lakers. We would still be even after 3 but Kobe was waking up and Carmelo was slowing down. Meanwhile, JR Smith would be 3 of 10 from the field. Overall, Game 5 was horrible from both sides, it was just a question of who would suck less. 


The answer was the Lakers. Carmelo had scored an ugly 31 points, going 12 of 13 from the stripe and 9 of 23 from the field. Chauncey Billups’ foul trouble with stall what was a decent outing from him and Nene fouling didn’t help. It was ugly and we knew what was coming in Game 6. 


Game 6 would be a stomp. Kobe would go for 35, Carmelo would go for 25 and JR Smith would have 24. It was not a happy birthday for Carmelo Anthony. Averaging 27.2 points per game and attempting to carry Denver to the promise land would be forgotten. 

---


At 25 years old, it was a brutal reality check series. The team felt right, the story felt right but it simply wasn’t going to happen. His time in Denver felt like lost years. He was in an incredibly competitive conference, he wasn’t receiving the recognition for what he was able to accomplish as a young player in an incredibly competitive conference. 


It became even worst in 09-10 when again, people were getting excited about a possible Carmelo Anthony run and the highly anticipated regular season game against LeBron. But a first round exit to the forgotten Jerry Sloan Jazz would be the final straw, as he would request a trade the following season.And given the history of his time in Denver, he shouldn’t be blamed for wanting out. 


His career, in every sense, was a tragic story. Carmelo Anthony was an incredible player that obstacles he couldn’t avoid. And when it felt like he was finally overcoming the obstacles, another would appear. As we enter what appears will be legacy discussion of Carmelo Anthony, he should be remembered as of the greatest to ever do it. Sometimes, the hero doesn’t always win. 


The years in Denver are something to be remembered because Carmelo would join the list of ‘What-ifs?’ *What if he got out early? What if he was drafted to the Detroit Pistons? What if he and Allen Iverson could make it work? What if his body doesn’t give out in 2009?*


But his brilliance in 08-09 is what I will always remember. His ability to take a team that wasn’t expected to perform to the western conference finals was impressive. An organization that was prepared to start-over had to wait but they weren't going to help Carmelo in his pursuit of a championship. His skill as a scorer and his physical defense sometimes isn’t remember given his recent years as a veteran. People won’t remember the time where he truly was without much assistance without much support, how he would be the one let down and in need of a different environment.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,80416,public,self,[OC] A Nugget In Time: Briefly Remembering Carmelo Anthony’s 08-09 Denver Run,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/fn45qd/oc_a_nugget_in_time_briefly_remembering_carmelo/,some_ads,7,,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'AarMW2YN9Fo5XrreBO6gXz0t6hR2XXl7Zt2CcgWOvnI', 'resolutions': [{'height': 81, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/YxCkQQ3LlzpeVJQednYjSTO1EGEiEZzuseXHmf2kN_E.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdc53a9077316bd66ede8f8d0909cc593485a1bc', 'width': 108}, {'height': 162, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/YxCkQQ3LlzpeVJQednYjSTO1EGEiEZzuseXHmf2kN_E.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=568275991adb9ce89aabdcdc15d5be94948e7792', 'width': 216}, {'height': 240, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/YxCkQQ3LlzpeVJQednYjSTO1EGEiEZzuseXHmf2kN_E.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a20f98007a50b0f3db19b5dab65e63bfbe9acf86', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/YxCkQQ3LlzpeVJQednYjSTO1EGEiEZzuseXHmf2kN_E.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=db072b1dea541f9b9895106f2bf59484abfe109b', 'width': 480}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,

In short, the website simulates seasons of user-created teams that can be built from a database of every season of every NBA&amp;ABA player ever - and each season of each player is assigned a salary. You are working within a salary cap and you get to build a 12 man roster to compete in a simulated season of 82 simulated games (plus playoffs) against other teams within a league. You can set your starters/bench, target minutes for each player, coaching preferences and make slight opponent adjustments, but most of it comes down to how well you built your team, chemistry being key (don’t waste money on too many scorers, get the scoring you need and surround it with passing, boards, D, etc) however, it gets way more advanced the deeper you dive.

Users have taken to the forums to create custom ""theme"" leagues, and this is where it gets really fun IMO. Heads up: leagues do cost. You can win free or discounted seasons by making the playoffs and winning playoff rounds - and one season lasts about 1 month in the forum (drafting/trading/etc) and about 2 months in the SIM. Types of different leagues that exist:

**Progressive leagues:** These leagues work a lot like running a real-life team as a GM. When the league is founded, the commissioner picks a starting year (lets use 1979 as an example) and all 24 owners go through a huge draft where they draft every player who existed in that year at their “current” age. For this type of league, you'll want to value the player as a whole including their age - as in how many years they have left in their career and how many of those are good seasons. After you draft your 12-man squad for the inaugural season, the season runs as normal (82 simulated games where you make some settings and preference adjustments) plus playoffs and eventually a champion. In the ""offseason"" there is a lottery, a draft of all incoming players (so since this hypothetical league started in 79-80, the draft would be for all players who debuted in 80-81), trades can be made between teams and then you can drop anyone and add a FA after the draft - all done within the forums. These leagues are fun because they go year after year with mostly the same group of owners and you can plan for the future, tank, retool, keep trading your late firsts to try to keep your contender alive...whatever you would like to do as GM. 

If you’re interested in this mode, I am the commissioner of a league and I think we have a spot opening up in the next offseason. We’re entering the 04-05 offseason soon (Dwight’s rookie year). There are about 6 of these types of leagues across the site (with various tweaks) and if you want a spot, you kinda gotta just keep an eye out in the forums and pounce on an opening. Once people are in, most of us stay together for literal years, progressing through decades of NBA history. If we get an influx of new owners, I can just start a new progressive league from scratch too. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Draft leagues:** These are one-off leagues that revolve around a big draft and every player can only be selected once. A salary cap is set prior to the draft (some are low-cap and challenging to budget, some are a higher cap) and the player pool is determined by the commissioner (most drafts have every player ever available, but some run for a certain decade of NBA history (e.g. 90-99) or even just one real-life NBA season). No duplicates are allowed, meaning that when someone drafts Steph Curry, they can only use one season of him and no one else can use any Steph Currys. The drafts are in snake-order and winners come from all draft positions (if you draft right, you can pick last in the first and have the best team). These are really fun and challenging. The season then runs as normal using the drafted teams because we all enter our teams in to the actual SIM afterward and play 82 games plus playoffs. Here is the most recent draft. We’re about to run this season and compete against each other using what we drafted. Some of the players probably went higher/lower than you’d expect. Keep in mind we’re working within a salary cap and that efficiency is king.

&amp;#x200B;

There are also other leagues people have created that have very unique rules. One league I am in you own 12 players but the season you get from them is random (between all possible years of there career) and then you lose 2 random players each season and those players make up the next draft class. It's interesting because you have to factor in a player's whole career (like MJ's MIA seasons) when valuing players for trades and drafting. Just keep an eye out in the classifieds for openings. 

**Open leagues:** These are default run by the website and anyone can simply enter any team with no real rules aside from a salary cap. This might be a good place to start but it's certainly not the most fun. I haven’t played these in a while but usually there’s a lot of cookie cutter teams that are all very similar to each other. Drafts with a player pool and progressives that work like real life GMing prevent that problem, which is why I prefer those.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**So how does it work?**

The SIM uses players real life stats to determine outcomes of each possession of a game. There is stamina that is based on how many minutes that player played in real life. All stats are based on %s, which helps compare eras better. Don't focus on things like PPG - you want to instead look at that player's usage % to see how often he shot/got fouled/turned the ball over per 100 possessions, and then his eFG% to see how efficiently he scored on that usage. Drafting too much usage will lead to losses, simply because usage factors in to the player's salary (you're paying for it) and if you draft 6 guys that all need 25 shots a game, they're not going to all get their touches but you will have paid for those touches you never got. It's better to draft a couple of high usage/high efficiency guys and use the rest of your money on rebounding, passing, defense, etc...

&amp;#x200B;

You'll want to not focus so much on the name-value of the player and instead focus on the numbers they give you. Allen Iverson isn't very good in this game because he’s going to take a lot of your salary cap, shoot a lot of your shots, and miss a lot of them. Richaun Holmes is good in this game since he’s a great rebounder, high % scorer, and cheap. Speaking of Richaun Holmes, you'll want to look at ""position effectiveness"". It will tell you how effective a player is at all 5 positions. Some of it is common sense. You don't want to play Shaq at SG. Some of it is a little weird but you can use it to your advantage. Lots of real life PFs like Dennis Rodman, Elton Brand, Serge Ibaka, Richaun Holmes, Horace Grant are 100% effective at SF for some reason. If you can live with their lack of 3s (by drafting guys like Steph who give you an abundance) then putting one of these guys at SF plus 2 true big men at PF and C, it can give you a big rebounding advantage. There are other strategies, that’s one example.

&amp;#x200B;

Players have scoring zones (paint, midrange, perimeter), based on real life numbers. You’ll want to diversify where your shots are coming from so that your opponent can’t pack the paint or camp the 3 point line against you (an adjustment you can set against your opponent). Defense is important and if you do it right, you can draft 3 good defenders who can ""switch"" with your 2 bad ones (like a good defensive player who is 95%+ at PG and SG and a bad defensive player who is 95%+ at PG and SG) and the SIM will “optimize” your matchup by putting the better defender on the opponent’s best guard. However, both will need to be able to play at least 95% efficiency at the other’s position for this to work. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is going to be a lot of trial and error, most of it will be learning from experience. However, here are 2 good threads written by another user with lots of helpful info:

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to jump in to a theme league, this would probably be a good start. It’s the Kobe Bryant Memoriam League. Every team has to have a ($6.5m+) season of Kobe on their team and finish the rest of the team within the $47m salary cap. The reason your Kobe has to cost 6.5m+ is so that he’s a focal part of your team instead of drafting one of his low minute seasons as a bench player. No clones (meaning you can’t draft two Shaqs or two Stocktons or whatever). And that’s it. I recommend surrounding him with lower usage, efficient guys that can do other things like rebound, play D, etc. Drafting a bunch of scorers would waste your cap money because they won’t all be able to get their normal shots off with Kobe. Aim for ~19300 total minutes. More than 19500 minutes and you’re spending too much money on minutes that you won’t use (82x48x5 = 19680 but you won’t get much fatigue turning 19300 into 19680). If you want to play, comment in this linked thread and start building your team in the draft center in league# 63778. If this doesn’t make sense, message me and I’ll clarify.

30.5 pts, 4.2 reb, 6.1 ast, 1.2 stl with a 57.9 TS%, 17.7 AST-TO%, and **34.4% USG%** while playing 36 minutes per game this season on a terrible team — and again, he’s only 26

Here are the players I’d say are definitely above him right now: Giannis, LeBron, Harden, Curry, healthy KD, Lillard, AD, healthy PG

So that leaves him in the Embiid, Jokic, Kyrie, Westbrook, Doncic, Butler range, and I think there’s a solid argument for Beal over any of those guys right now, he has really stepped up his game and it’s gone almost completely under the radar. Right now he seems to be stuck with the Wiz for at least the next 2-3 seasons, but if he ever moves to a contender then watch out

I was actually shocked when I looked up his stats this year, but looking at his [career trajectory it’s not all that surprising](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bealbr01.html). He’s been in the league for 8 seasons now after being drafted at 19, and he’s improved every single year. Just look at his stat lines over the past 5 seasons:

**2015-16:** 20.2 pts, 4.0 reb, 3.4 ast on 54.7 TS%, 4.3 AST-TO%, 25.3 USG%

**2016-17:** 23.1 pts, 3.1 reb, 3.5 ast on 60.4 TS%, 6.6 AST-TO%, 26.5 USG% 

**2017-18:** 22.6 pts, 4.4 reb, 4.5 ast on 56.4 TS%, 9.5 AST-TO%, 27.6 USG%

**2018-19:** 25.0 pts, 4.9 reb, 5.5 ast on 58.1 TS%, 13.1 AST-TO%, 28.4 USG%

**2019-20:** 30.5 pts, 4.2 reb, 6.1 ast on 57.9 TS%, 17.7 AST-TO%, 34.4% USG%

Two major things that stick out are Beal’s constant improvement in passing and getting to the line. As seen above, his AST-TO% has steadily increased each year even as his usage goes up. And even more noticable is how his FTr has gone up in this same 5 year time frame: .220, .259, .249, .278, and an extremely impressive .351 this past season — all without John Wall on the court

If Beal continues to improve at this rate, what is his ceiling? Could he possibly develop into a superstar, top-5 player, especially if he gets moved to a contender, or even a playoff team at the very least? Obviously on a better team he wouldn’t put up the same counting stats as he is now, but I’d bet his efficiency would go way up if he had another star with him. What does everyone think — I’m not a Wizards fan and haven’t really watched Beal play at all recently, so there could be something I’m missing, but just looking at his stats has me really impressed",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,80386,public,self,Is Bradley Beal currently a top-10 player?,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/fmkq2f/is_bradley_beal_currently_a_top10_player/,some_ads,7,,,099e778a-8b9a-11e8-b53d-0eebf66bed8a,Player Discussion,,,,,,,,,,,

Yugoslavian Athletics were dominant for decades; their soccer team finished in the quarterfinals of the world cup twice (1930, 1964), finishing 4th both times, as well as coming in second in the Euros twice (1960, 1968), and winning 1 Olympic Gold, 3 Silvers, and a Bronze (1960; 1948, 1965, 1956; 1984). 

This post is not about the footballing ability of the South Slavs of course, but how well they shoot hoops. The Yugoslavian National Basketball team won: Olympic 1 Gold medal, 3 Silvers, and 1 Bronze (1980; 1968, 1976, 1988; 1984); 3 FIBA World Cup Golds, plus 3 Silvers and 2 Bronze (1970, 1978, 1990; 1963, 1967, 1974; 1982, 1986); as well as 5 FIBA EuroCup Golds, 5 Silvers, and 3 Bronze Medals (1973, 1975, 1977, 1989, 1991; 1961, 1965, 1969, 1971, 1981; 1963, 1979, 1987). After the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1992, the constituent republics all began to field their own national teams. But the spirit of Yugoslavian basketball is alive, represented by the Adriatic League, which is comprised of the best teams from all 6 former Yugoslavian republics. So what would a modern Yugoslavian National Team look like? In honor of Yugoslavian basketball legend Boris Stanković, I present my 12 man roster:
	
Positions| Starters | 2nd String | 3rd String
:--|:--:|:--:|:--:
PG | Goran Dragić | Stefan Jović | Roko Leni Ukić
SG | Luka Doncić | Bogdan Bogdanović | 
SF | Bojan Bogdanović | Dzanan Musa |
PF | Nemanja Bjelica | Luka Samanić | 
C | Nikola Jokić | Jusef Nurkić | Boban Marjonović

A few things that jumped out to me while putting this team together was the major star power present with two top-25 players in Luka and Jokić, the depth of the center position, and the high level of shooting all over this roster. Offensively this is a versatile time able to run out dual big line-ups, with Jokić and Nurk, or play 4- or 5-out lineups with plus shooters like Bojan, Bogdan, Bjelica and Dragić. They have multiple playmakers who can run the pick-and-roll, and the pick-and-pop. This team also has willing cutters including Luka, Bojan, and Musa who could find lots of easy ways to score around Jokić

That's not to say there aren't any holes on this roster. Goran Dragić is the only true point guard of NBA quality on the roster. The Jokić and Nurkić dual big experiment largely failed in Denver. This team could also rely on unproven prospects Dzanan Musa and Luka Samanić for heavy minutes on the wing. There are also some defensive question marks. The lack of a proven stopper on the wing, plus a leaky backcourt could mean trouble against teams at the highest level of international play. Big guards and talented wings like Australia's Joe Ingles and Ben Simmons, France's Frank Ntilikina, Nicolas Batum, and Evan Fournier, and The United State's multitude of wing players present major challenges to winning international tournaments.

But these are challenges to coming in first, and this roster would still be highly competitive, capable of scoring lots of points in lots of different ways. Defensive weaknesses could be mitigated somewhat by playing Nurkić in the middle. This is also a big, long team that can switch often, so a team emphasis on defense could make up for a lack of individual talent. It was with this in mind that I picked Dzanan Musa, Stefan Jović, and Roko Leni Ukić. Musa stands at 6'9, with Jović at 6'6 and Leni Ukić at 6'5, they add length to the backup guard spots behind 6'3 Goran Dragić. Musa especially is raw, but shows 1-4 potential on defense, not unlike Luka Doncić. This team mixes youth with international experience. Picking Samanić over more proven Euro players might be controversial with some groups, but his national team experience with Croatia despite being only 19 pushed him over the hump for me. This team has good rebounders down low and on the wing which will help cover up defensive weakness by preventing second chance points. As I mentioned previously the center position would be among the deepest on the international stage, capable of going toe to toe with Spain, France, Lithuania or the US.

I had a great time researching this post and I hope you enjoyed reading it. I made this post to honor Borislav Stanković and the history of Yugoslavian basketball, NOT to make a political statement, and I apologize if I inadvertently offended anyone! I am not a super dedicated fan, so this team is mostly picked from NBA players and wikipedia. As such, I would love to have your opinions as I am sure in my ignorance I missed some great players who deserve to be on the roster!

Let's assume this is a fact, why is this the case?

I'll explore some possible reasons and give my opinion on them

1. The NBA was formed after the NFL and MLB. 

This is a fact, the NBA started in 1946 while the NFL started in 1918 and MLB started before 1900. All leagues had predecessor leagues. The theory here is that the NBA wasn't really a big deal until Michael Jordan (let's say 1988) so older fans grew up before the NBA was a big deal. 

This might have some validity but I think it's kinda a cop out. First, the NBA was popular when guys like Kareem and Wilt played. No idea why reddit thinks otherwise. Second, Magic and Bird made it super popular in the early 1980s. That was 40 years ago, so anyone under 50 grew up with the NBA being super popular. Not to mention the NBA feels less popular today, in America, than it was in the 1990s. 

Are the people who were fans of Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Kareem etc. not fans anymore?

2. Too many 3 pointers/not enough defense

You can throw in other complaints about style of play including decline of the big man but those two are the most prevalent. To many, the NBA feels like a 3 point contest with some dribbling. I don't think this is valid because the NFL is as popular as ever and they play a different style of football as they used to.

3. Players are too friendly with each other

This theory is that players are all buddy buddy and fans realize that. They know that guys care more about maintaining friendships than winning. I think this exists in football so I don't buy it.

4. Load Management

Self explanatory. And it's a legit reason. I bet older generations look down on the modern NBA player because the only reason the NBA is popular/profitable enough to allow load management is on the backs of their predecessors. If Kareem or Wilt load managed, the NBA might have died. 

5. The league is driven by social media

This theory is that the NBA has tailored itself to the twitter crowd. It's about drama, free agency etc. 

I personally think this is the main reason. The NBA realized that they'll never beat the NFL in TV ratings but they can beat them in social media. The NBA is the only sports league where its offseason has more buzz than it's regular season. Free Agency is the second biggest time of the NBA calender (finals are most) and free agency is more impactful than most of the playoffs. It's frankly sad

There used to be a site or a page where you could see the in-depth lineup rotations per minute/quarter in certain NBA games. Does anyone remember and know the name of such site? Doing a personal side-project and that would be GREATLY helpful.

In particular interested in the last few lineups of the Utah Jazz, as  they seemed to have struck gold with their lineup management (especially on the bench end of the floor)

Hey everyone - obviously COVID-19 has brought the basketball world to a halt and there's a lot of uncertainty regarding if/when leagues will return and the safety of players.  To that point, I consulted with a trusted epidemiologist and infectious disease expert to learn why postponing leagues and sporting events was crucial, if athletes are more at-risk of contracting the virus or becoming seriously ill, and key factors and timelines which may determine when leagues could return. Thanks to the mods for letting me post.

Jordan later stated that he felt betrayed, and that if he had known he would be fired upon retiring he never would have come back to play for the Wizards""

Especially as MJ was willing to play for salary of 1 mil, he could actually choose where he could go easily. So, what do you think where he would fit best? Which roster &amp; coach would be able to get the best of him and make him happy on the same side, in order to win a title?

So without trading anyone from the roster, just to add MJ. I had a quick look and Spurs, with Robinson &amp; Timmy, young Parker, Bowen led by Pop seems like a perfect fit. Question is how MJ would fit in Pop's philosophy. 

What would be cool is Minny; KG &amp; Billups, decent team, made playoffs.

What would be like coming home; Charlotte. Young Baron Davies, Mashburn &amp; Wesley to help scoring, PJ Brown under the rim. Cool.

Sonics - GP still putting top numbers. They would make most vicious front court ever. Rashard Lewis &amp; Vin Baker there to help.

Other times you'll have those who don't go in-depth with their research and will just assume that because players such as Manu Ginòbili, Tony Parker, and David Robinson were on the roster, they somehow performed to the best of their abilities. Some will also say that those 3 were at their peak or at least rather close it.

This couldn't be further from the truth. For starters, Ginòbili was a rookie who had not started a single game that season while Parker was a sophomore guard who had struggles shooting the ball. Robinson, albeit a good defensive front-court partner, was very clearly a shell of his past self due to both age and injury. 

From here on out, I'll show how he and the rest of the team performed in each round of the postseason. I'll choose the 5 best performers from each round, so you'll see a consistent change in the group of names. So let's begin:

#1st round vs. Phoenix

Player | PTS/REB/AST | FG% | 3PT%
---------|----------|----------|----------
Ginòbili | 7.7/3.8/3.8 | 28.0% | 40.9%
Jackson | 16.2/4.8/3.5 | 43.2% | 37.1%
Parker | 13.5/2.0/2.5 | 39.8% | 11.8
Robinson | 9.6/8.8/0.6 | 59.4% | 0.00%
Rose | 13.8/8.7/0.8 | 40.7% | 0.00%

3 of the team's best performers excluding Duncan had shot below 41% from the field. 3 of these 5 players had provided virtually no 3-point shooting or spacing to that team. Duncan this round led his team in 4 out of major statistical categories by averaging roughly 19 points, 16 rebounds, 5 assists and over 3 blocks in this series. 

This Suns team was nothing too special. They won 44 games and had a top-10 defense. They were led by Stephon Marbury and Shawn Marion. The team also featured players such as Penny Hardaway, Joe Johnson, and Amarè Stoudemire. Not a great team, certainly not a bad team. The Spurs won this series in 6 games.

#2nd round vs. Los Angeles

Player | PTS/REB/AST | FG% | 3PT%
---------|----------|----------|----------
Bowen | 11.2/2.7/1.8 | 55.8% | 65.4%
Claxton | 6.5/1.5/2.2 | 51.7% | 0.00%
Ginòbili | 11.7/3.3/2.5 | 51.2% | 61.5%
Jackson | 8.3/4.2/2.2 | 32.7% | 18.8%
Parker | 14.8/2.8/3.5 | 40.5% | 33.3

Bowen, Ginòbili, and Parker showed up to play this series. This was arguably their best series in terms of production during this entire championship run. David Robinson only played 21 minutes per game this series and his numbers were very pedestrian. Jackson, from the look of it, couldn't throw a pebble in the ocean. 

This was by far the most impressive defeat in my opinion, because they toppled the Shaq-and-Kobe Lakers. The Lakers had just won 3 straight championships and hadn't suffered a playoff series defeat since 1999. 
Duncan also took on the challenge of guarding Shaquille O'Neal due to Robinson and Willis playing only a combined 30 minutes per game. 

Duncan this series averaged about 28 points, 12 rebounds, 5 assists, and over 1 block. He had led his team in 3 out of the 5 major statistical categories as well. He will repeat this trend for the rest of this postseason run, continuing to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, and blocks. The Spurs won this series in 6 games. 

#WCF vs. Dallas

Player | PTS/REB/AST | FG% | 3PT%
---------|----------|----------|----------
Bowen | 8.0/3.3/2.0 | 30.0% | 37.5%
Ginòbili | 9.7/3.7/3.3 | 42.6% | 33.3%
Jackson | 16.3/3.2/2.5 | 49.3% | 35.3%
Parker | 16.3/3.0/4.0 | 42.2% | 25.0%
Rose | 10.7/6.2/1.7 | 41.3% | 0.00%

Not an atrocious series for the rest of the team, but certainly not good by any measure. The team was wildly inconsistent and although Ginòbili wasn't necessarily bad this series, he had come back down to Earth from his hot shooting streak from the series prior along with Bowen. Robinson once again hardly played. The team produced though nonetheless. 

The Mavericks team the Spurs defeated had won 60 games, had the league's best offense, and even had the 9th-best defense as well. The team was led by the elite offensive trio that was Michael Finley, Steve Nash, and Dirk Nowitzki. Nick Van Exel provided some scoring off the bench as well. 

Unfortunately, Nowitzki only played 3 games in this series due to injury. But in those 3 games, Duncan played great defense on him. In the 2 playoff series prior to facing the Spurs, Nowitzki averaged 25 points on 49/49/89 shooting splits. 

How did he fare against Duncan? Nowitzki averaged 25 points on 43/29/100 shooting splits while attempting 20 shots to get those 25 points. 

Duncan averaged 28 points, 17 rebounds, 6 assists, and 3 blocks. He, once again, led his team in 4 out of 5 major statistical categories along with leading them in FG%. The Spurs also won this series in 6 games. 

#NBA Finals vs. New Jersey

Player | PTS/REB/AST | FG% | 3PT%
---------|----------|----------|----------
Ginòbili | 8.7/4.5/2.0 | 34.8% | 21.4%
Jackson | 10.3/4.2/2.7 | 37.7% | 35.7%
Parker | 14.0/3.2/4.2 | 38.6% | 42.9%
Robinson | 10.8/7.3/0.7 | 61.1% | 0.00%
Rose | 7.7/3.8/0.7 | 44.2% | 0.00%

Probably the worst performance from the rest of the Spurs overall. Bowen was just atrocious offensively, which is why I didn't list him. Defensively they did their part, which is the least they could do. Robinson was fairly solid this series after underperforming the previous 2. 

The Nets team Duncan and the Spurs they defeated was solid, they had made the finals just the season prior and won 50 games. They also had an 12-2 record en route to the NBA Finals. They were led by Jason Kidd and Kenyon Martin while getting some scoring outout from Lucious Harris, Richard Jefferson, and Kerry Kittles. They also had the league's #1 defense. 

But Duncan was just utterly dominant this series on both ends. He held Kenyon Martin to averaging about 15 points on 34.3% shooting. He had to shoot 18 shots just get these 15 points a game. 

Duncan averaged a whopping 24 points, 17 rebounds, over 5 assists, and over 5 blocks. He once again led the Spurs in 4 out of the 5 major statistical categories. The Spurs closed this series out in 6 games once again. 

He was utterly dominant the entire postseason run. He led the Spurs in points, rebounds, assists, and blocks. He also led all postseason players in total points, total rebounds, total blocks, and field-goals made.


#Disclaimer

I did not make this post to thoroughly trash Duncan's teammates and supporting cast whatsoever. There were numerous times in his career where his team pulled through while he was struggling. 

I just made this post to debunk the myth that nearly every single one of Duncan's championships were won mostly in part to his great teammates. That was the case for the 2014 finals and the last 2 games of the 2007 finals but not for the other 3 championships.

After the sixth draft concluded, we decided to take the average draft position of every single player ever drafted and give them an exponential financial valuation where you can draft a 8-player team with a **budget of $100.** We set a cap of $45 for a single player for now but we want to test it out to make it as accurate as possible. Both LeBron and Jordan will cost $45, with a noticeable drop-off afterward due to how highly coveted LeBron and Jordan turned out to be in our drafts, and there not being a clear 3rd best player. 

To test out the accuracy of this, I wanted to let a larger community test it out, so I will post a list below with all the players that are valued at $2 or more, with anyone not on the list being available for $1. 

Keep in mind that these prices are based on exponential values of average draft positions and not my personal opinion, and that this is supposed to be each player at their absolute peak, so longevity is not a factor to be considered in this exercise. List the season of the player you want as well if you’d like. Also you should have **8 roster spots,** which would be an average of $12.5 per player. Another important thing to note is that these prices have been determined before there was a large enough sample size for the 2019-20 season, so please try to avoid selecting any players in their 2019-20 season. 

I will sort all players by the 5 main positions which can be somewhat subjective but will be better for organization. I’ll also put the team logo most generally associated with their peak season (also subjective) so it will be easier to spot them. I will also take suggestions on what prices should change since the way it was determined is obviously not perfect. Keep in mind that players that provide positive defensive value or 3-pt shooting are generally more valued than a player that does not.

This has become a necessary skill for virtually all positions. But there are more and more players playing in some new, crazier way. The world was primarily impressed with Steph Curry and his long range threes, but today some players take that long-range shooting to an even greater level.

## Trae and Dame

The other day I did a Shot Chart for Trae Young in the last two games before the NBA was suspended, and what amazed me was how far those shots actually were. At first glance I thought there was something wrong with the data, or that I was doing something wrong and I had to go visually check and confirm everything was alright.

And the conclusion is that this guy is really not normal. It is quite common for him to take threes from the Logo.

His [Shot Chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danchyy/danchyy.github.io/master/assets/long_range_shooters/trae_shotchart_bball_colors_dark.png) tells the same story, in fact because of his shot chart one would think that the three-point line is about 3 feet further.

But he’s not the only one following this trend of long-range three-point shots, another superstar doesn’t shy away from pulling a jumper from bigger distances, and that is Damian Lillard.

But his [Shot Chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danchyy/danchyy.github.io/master/assets/long_range_shooters/dame_shotchart_bball_dark.png) is not as extreme as Trae’s, you can at least tell the right distance of three point line, but there are still a lot of long-range shots in his style, like this unforgettable [Game Winner](https://streamable.com/k5ybm).

## A trend across the league

Trae and Dame are only the forerunners of this trend, that is, they are the most extreme in long-range shots. More and more top three point shooters are moving away from the true three point distance.


In this [chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danchyy/danchyy.github.io/master/assets/long_range_shooters/distance_3pt_feet_dark_orange_text_1.png) (or if you want, here is a [metric version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danchyy/danchyy.github.io/master/assets/long_range_shooters/distance_3pt_meters_dark_orange_text_2.png)), you can see what I’m talking about. So consider that the distance of the 3PT line is 23.75 feet on top of the key (7.24m), while in the corners the distance is 22 feet (6.70m). 

All those below 25ish feet are more-less sticking close to the 3pt line, which actually makes sense, because when you look at Bojan Bogdanović, he is one of the leaders in the league in corner triples this year (which reduces his average distance). The same goes for Joe Harris, Galloway, Justin Holiday, etc..

What’s more interesting here is that Dončić and Porzingis are right behind “The Far Away Duo”, Trae and Dame. They often set up a high Pick And Pop from which Porzingis launches deep threes. And we know everything about Dončić and his step back shots. LeBron also sneaked relatively “far”, with his famous “LeFuckYou” triple.

This [next graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danchyy/danchyy.github.io/master/assets/long_range_shooters/three_pt_distance_lines_ft.png) (once again, [metric version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danchyy/danchyy.github.io/master/assets/long_range_shooters/three_pt_distance_lines.png)) may show just how absurd Trae Young and Damian Lillard really are.

This picture roughly shows how far Trae and the Dame are shooting. Both are 3 feet deeper from the 3pt line. As I mentioned, Bojan Bogdanović is known for shooting a lot of threes from the corners, and Duncan Robinson, whom I covered in one of the previous posts, is a little further than Bojan, as he takes a lot of threes from Handoffs at the top of threes.

## Conclusion

Trae Young pushes the boundaries of shooting 3 pointers. He kind of remains in the shadow of Dončić, who won the ROY Award last year, and is leading the Mavericks to the Playoffs this year (or at least lead them), while Young with his Hawks sits at the bottom of the Eastern Conference.

But the Hawks are slowly building, gathering young players, and it looks like the current coach, Lloyd Pierce, is doing a good job of developing all those little wheels.

The real challenge will be to connect them into one well-oiled machine.

Although some say that the winner, Russell Westbrook, was awarded properly. You also have a certain amount of people who suggest Harden was more deserving due to having the small edge on Westbrook in terms of efficiency and an advantage in the W/L column.

Over the years, a small group of people have suggested Leonard deserved it over both due to him having an even bigger advantage over the 2 in efficiency, team record, and defense. And of course, you'll have the group that suggest LeBron James. Not much needs to be added there. 

I disagree. Firstly, take a look at the numbers below. Westbrook leads all of the other candidates in nearly every recorded statistic.

Next, let's take a look at the candidates' 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th options. As you'll come to see, James without a doubt has the best producing supporting cast. 

#Supporting cast
Westbrook | Harden | Leonard | James 
---------|----------|----------|----------
Oladipo: 15.9/4.3/2.6 | Gordon: 16.1/2.7/2.5 |  Aldridge: 17.3/7.2/1.9 | Irving: 25.2/3.2/5.8
Kanter: 14.3/6.7/0.9 | Anderson: 13.6/4.6/0.9 | Gasol: 12.4/7.8/2.3 | Love: 19.1/11/1.9
Adams: 11.3/7.7/1.1 | Capela: 12.6/8.1/1.2 | Parker: 10.1/1.8/4.5 | Korver: 10.6/2.6/2.7
Gibson: 9.0/4.5/0.7 | Ariza: 11.7/5.7/2.2 | Mills: 9.5/1.8/3.5 | Frye: 9.1/3.9/0.6

*Stats are in the order of PTS/REB/AST*

And as you can see, Westbrook has the least productive supporting cast. Not only that, but the Thunder were also constructed poorly. Which is why they ranked 26th in 3-pointers made per game and 30th overall in 3PT%, virtually no sort of spacing or 3-point shooter. 

Whereas LeBron James and James Harden had teams built to fit their needs. Shooters that could attract attention, unlock the paint, and open up the floor. 

Lastly, let's take a look at the candidates' clutch performance:

#Clutch statistics 
Westbrook | Harden | Leonard | James 
---------|----------|----------|----------
6.2 PPG **(1st)** | 3.8 PPG **(10th)** | 3.7 PPG **(12th)** | 3.2 PPG **(22nd)**
2.1 FGM **(1st)** | 0.8 FGM **(25th)** | 1.0 FGM **(13th)** | 1.0 FGM **(16th)**
4.6 FGA **(1st)** | 2.4 FGA **(15th)** | 2.6 FGA **(11th)** | 1.9 FGA **(28th)**
44.6 FG% | 35.5 FG% | 40.0 FG% | 53.0 FG%
32.8 3PT% | 27.3 3PT% | 23.8 3PT% | 48.4 3PT%

Statistically speaking, Westbrook was the most clutch player out of any MVP candidate and shot better than Harden and Leonard in the clutch, only outdone by LeBron James. 

A lot of people have stated that Westbrook only won because he averaged a triple-double, and quite frankly, they're right. Which is unfortunate because if you do the research and look at non-counting stats you'd see that his season was much more than the triple-double average. 

So this concludes why I think Westbrook deserved his MVP. He was just so dominant in every statistical category, was oddly efficient and effective in the clutch, and also averaged a triple-double for only the 2nd time in NBA history which ultimately won over the voters.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,80300,public,self,Why Russell Westbrook deserved his MVP,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/fl3tpx/why_russell_westbrook_deserved_his_mvp/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've been rewatching a lot of old games because of the unforeseen offseason. I've been trying to better understand the game.

Is there a system you use to analyze tape? I'm just analyzing for fun, but I want to do it properly. Right now, I just try to look at what matchups are created, what methods each team likes to use to attack the paint, rotations and shot selection in different situations.

[THE BRACKET](https://imgur.com/a/YucVoHL)

The first round:

2004 vs **2019**

20042019Dwight Howard**Zion Williamson (PF)**Emeka Okafor**Ja Morant (PG)**Ben Gordon**RJ Barrett (SG)**

I gotta go with 2019 here. This group is insanely balanced and freakishly athletic. Dwight Howard will bully Zion inside, but the spacing between Emeka and Dwight is a huge concern and come on... who is stopping Ja throwing lobs to Zion?

**2008** vs 2015

20082015**Derrick Rose (PG)**Karl Anthony-Towns (C)**Michael Beasley (PF)**D'Angelo Russell (PG)**OJ Mayo (SG)**Jahlil Okafor (C)

This is a tough one for me, because 2008 (the all potential team) is incredibly balanced and in all honesty probably play above their NBA production on a streetball court, but D'Angelo and KAT are a potent duo who can hit every shot on the court. I think Rose thrives in this tourney and Mayo and Beasley relish the stage. Going with 2008 and it may be controversial.

**2010** vs 2013

20102013**John Wall (PG)**Anthony Bennett (PF)**Evan Turner (SG)**Victor Oladipo (SG)**Derrick Favors (PF)**Otto Porter Jr. (SF)

Weak matchup. Not sexy at all. Oladipo does sing the anthem to kick of the tournament. That is really all the 2013 team can take home from this. 2010 blows them out.

**2006** vs 2017

20062017**Andera Bargnani (PF)**Markelle Fultz (PG)**Lamarcus Aldridge (PF)**Lonzo Ball (PG)**Adam Morrison (SF)**Jayson Tatum (SF)

2017 has the defense between Lonzo and Tatum. Tatum is going to boom Aldridge. It is known. But for some reason and based off all the times my homies and I got run off the court by a bunch of tall dudes that could shoot lights out.... I gotta go with 2006 here.

2005 **vs 2018**

20052018Andrew Bogut (C)**Deandre Ayton (C)**Marvin Williams (PF)**Marvin Bagley Jr. (PF)**Deron Williams (PG)**Luka Dončić (PG)**

A lot of younger folks on here may be forgetting just how amazing Deron Williams was. I would love to see rookie Deron take on Luka. Insane basketball IQ. This is a 1 on 1 matchup for most of the game but Luka starts facilitating and the rest of the 2018 team is just a tad bit stronger for me.

**2009** vs 2014

20092014**Blake Griffin (PF)**Andrew Wiggins (SF)**Hasheem Thabeet (C)**Jabari Parker (PF)**James Harden (SG)**Joel Embiid (C)

Hasheem Thabeet is an absolute liability here. Let's just get that out of the way... But Griffin and Harden is a nasty duo and we can park Thabeet in the paint without 3 seconds being called. This may be a controversial pick, but Maple Jordan, Mormon Jordan and The Process come up just short here.

2011 vs **2012**

20112012Kyrie Irving (PG)**Anthony Davis (PF)**Derrick Williams (SF)**Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (SF)**Enes Kanter (C)**Bradley Beal (SG)**

Huh... TIR that Enes Kanter was a Top 3 pick. No shade. Love Kanter. **But Kyrie, ""What does the word blowout mean to you?**"" 2012 is one of my favorites for this tournament. Elite D and two superstars. 21-3 final.

2007 vs. **2016**

20072016Greg Oden (C)**Ben Simmons (PG)**Kevin Durant (SF)**Brandon Ingram (SF)**Al Horford (C)**Jaylen Brown (SG)**

2007 is deeply affected by the Oden/Horford spacing (if only Mike Conley went a spot higher...). Can Ingram shoulder the scoring load over the course of the tourney? I don't know. But 2016 has enough defense to frustrate KD and knock out the best player in the tournament in the first round.

- Steve Nash : Won in 2005 &amp; 2006
- LeBron James : Won in 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 (outlier)
- Stephen Curry : Won in 2015 &amp; 2016
- Giannis might be en route in 2019 &amp; 2020 but still too early to tell, but still confirms my point 

Do you think this pattern will become a trend, where players tend to win MVPs in a bulk rather than having them split with seasons in between ?

One could factor in the fact that there is voter fatigue, or that players tend to rest more during the regular season when getting old which could be a consequence of the game being harder on the body. Could that also be a consequence of a lack of interest from players to win it when they leave their peak ? 

It seems like it has also become harder to win the MVP title once players ""leave"" their physical prime. In the past few years, MVP winners have usually had exceptional seasons while other players performed well (James Harden in 2017, LeBron in 2018, KD and Harden in 2016 though the race wasn't that close). 

Talking about previous multiple MVP winners with several seasons in between: 

- Michael Jordan : First MVP in 88 and last in 98 (record for biggest gap between first and last title)
- Kareem Abdul Jabbar : First in 71, last in 80
- Wilt : First in 60, last in 67
- Bill Russell : First in 58, last in 65

Meanwhile a lot of children worldwide are losing their afternoon activities and boredom of children is a dangerous factor in a global pandemic because it can lead to bad decisions in a global economy that is designed for double income families. Mark Cuban‘s estimated lockdown for at least 60 days now seems very optimistic, considering recent development and prognosis of virologists and other scientists. 

Therefore, I was wondering if it was in the interest of e-sports leagues, nba players and maybe even the nba itself to consider several tournaments of its stars designed to keep children wrapped up in digital content and off the street or out of grocery stores for the upcoming weeks. 

Would nba players even consider this without huge cash incentives? Would the nba allow e-sports to market itself with nba players’ names? Would older nba fans watch these streams? 

I know this is not a typical nba discussion, but I know that there is a lot of boredom and frustration of fathers who cannot bond with their kids over nba games anymore for the time being and this might be both a quick fix for keeping children at home entertained and maybe even arouse new interest in the older generation for e-sports in a time of need for something competitive to watch.

I saw a post recently which described CJ McCollum as being eloquent, which he is, but showing ""low basketball IQ."" In this post, I want to detail the differences between different types of intelligence using the concepts we are familiar with in basketball in the hopes of educating people:

*Warning: Be prepared for long post*

**Part I: Traditional theories of intelligence**

In discussing the more traditional theory of intelligence, I will be using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales, 4th Edition (WAIS-IV) as my primary guidance since this is the most common intelligence test and the one I am most familiar with.

When people traditionally refer to intelligence, what they refer to is only one part of the traditional conceptualization of intelligence, the Verbal Comprehension Index. This includes areas like vocabulary, comparing and contrasting ideas and synthesizing concepts. This is fundamentally the kind of intelligence we learn to develop in schools, and is this conflated with the concept of intelligence as a whole. Raymond Cattell's concept of general intelligence refers to this type of intelligence as crystallized intelligence.

However, there is so much more to classical intelligence than this conceptualization of intelligence. Perceptual Reasoning involves the recognition of patterns and (implied) distance as well as problem-solving that apply when a player chooses a spot from the court to shoot. Working Memory tests concentration and the ability to retain multiple pieces of information simultaneously, which helps players make good decisions. Finally, Processing Speed tests the speed at which you are able to recognize information and make quick decisions. These last 3 components, which account for around 70% of an IQ score, are often taken out of the discussion of intelligence overall, but are clearly evident in Basketball IQ.

**Part II: Theory of Multiple Intelligences**

Now that we have discussed traditional intelligence, it is also important to discuss how multiple intelligence theory adds to our conceptualization. Musical-rhythmic intelligence is the intelligence that allows players to change the speed of their dribble or to lull players into a stupor like James Harden does before attacking them. We can fold interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligence mostly into emotional intelligence (EQ), which allows players to understand themselves and others better and leads to good teamwork as well as being able to play mind games with other players, as Jordan was known to do. A lot of this is the game within the game parts that many players talk about.

The most important intelligence for basketball players however, in my mind, is bodily-kinesthetic intelligence. This is the intelligence of being able to move your body in the right way to achieve your goals. You see bodily-kinesthetic intelligence when Klay Thompson squares himself up for a 3 coming off a screen, the angle that Stephen Adams sets on a screen to get Chris Paul a good shot and when Alex Caruso uses the right angle with his body to box out the physically superior Giannis Antetokounmpo.

This is just a short discussion of basketball and intelligence and this doesn't do the full topic justice, but I look forward to hearing from everyone and their feedback.",False,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,80210,public,self,Speaking intelligently vs Basketball IQ: A discussion of intelligence in the context of basketball,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/fja87p/speaking_intelligently_vs_basketball_iq_a/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Before he would take his talents to South Beach, before he would vibe out to *California Love*, before he would breathe and ESPN would have a 20-minute analysis regarding it, he was the kid from Ohio attempting to bring glory to Cleveland. Despite the world understanding his greatness, there was still skepticism. His first play-off series would have to wait until 2006.  


Dan Gilbert, seeing the opportunity he had with LeBron James, had to make changes. He would bring on a new general manager and new head coach—Danny Ferry and Mike Brown. The team would also bring in Larry Hughes, Zydrunas Ilgauskas into the thick of things that would help provide support for the young superstar. 


LeBron James would have his best points-per-game season that would last his entire career—scoring 31.4 points per game on 23.1 field goals per game and 10.3 free throw attempts. Big Z and Anderson Varejao would split minutes at the 5 and were critical in spacing the paint—or crowded the paint and simply out-manning their opponents for rebounds. Ronald Murray and Larry Hughes would provide spacing and Eric Snow would pass the ball to LeBron.


This was the year where it felt like the world was bracing itself for LeBron to introduce himself as a force to be reckoned with. They would finish with a record of 50-32, finish 2nd in the central division. They would have the 5th highest attendance. It was showtime.


LeBron’s first play-off opponent would be against the Washington Wizards. The three of Gilbert Arenas, Antawn Jamison and Caron Butler would attempt to utilize the Eddie Jordan Princeton Offense. Not only did the style not take advantage of the talent on that team, it limited its star player—who would effectively not abide by the system’s principles and do his own him. Yet, it got them to a 5th seed in the play-offs in a weak conference.


Truly, everyone was ready for the spectacle that would be LeBron versus Gilbert. In the previous season, Arenas wasn’t the man we all knew and loved — he would split opportunities with Jamison, Larry Hughes. Now, it was different. He wanted to make a point. 


The regular season went 3-1 in the favor of Washington. The only game that went into the favor of Cleveland was their first match-up—an emotional game for Larry Hughes who left the franchise the summer prior because Washington low-balled him on a contract. Gilbert would have an off-night after putting up 34 on San Antonio the game prior. Washington would win the next 3 — two of which, featured poor performances from James and the final game being James’ first game back from injury. 


Analysts would predict Cleveland to win the series easy but there were still some concerns. *We hadn't seen LeBron on the biggest stage, he was good but his team wasn't.*
---


Game 1 would take place in Cleveland. We would see the signature powder toss to start the game, the crowd was excited to see play-off basketball for the first time in sometime. And more importantly, it was a must-win game to set the tone for the series. 


Eddie Jordan would come out of the gates with a 2-3 zone however it would not stop LeBron. LeBron would have 13 points, 4 assists and 3 rebounds in the first quarter. Like Fury coming out strong against Wilder, it wasn’t expected that LeBron could keep up the pace against the zone and, more importantly, Gilbert wouldn’t allow it to happen. But the Wizards wouldn’t make an appearance until the fourth quarter and by then, it was too late. 


LeBron James would record a triple-double in his first play-off game and the Cave would take Game 1 with ease.


Game 2, suddenly became a must win game for the Washington Wizards. 


The Wizards again, would have a slow start but fortunately, so did LeBron James. Drew Gooden’s impact on the boards would account for 8 points, LeBron James would have 11 to start the game but the team would only be up two. Caron Butler would bail out the slumping Antawn Jamison, going 5 for 9 from the field, accounting for 10 1st quarter points and keeping the game at least close. The combo of Gilbert and Caron would keep the Wizards afloat—going on a 22-to-2 run just by themselves during the 1st half.


As time ticked and the close remained extremely close, LeBron James’s inexperience would show. His 10 turnovers—6 in the second half—were free points for a Gilbert Arenas that seemingly wouldn’t let the team lose. Antawn Jamison would score 19 points in the second half—21 for the night—finally making an appearance in the play-offs.


And then Caron Butler fouled out. An eight point lead that felt like it would seal the game didn’t matter.

With 19.6 seconds left, the Wizards would only have a 3-point lead. But Butler’s substitution—Billy Thomas—would have a chance to seal the deal at the line. Of course he didn’t seal the deal, it wouldn’t make for good television or a good story. And of course, LeBron James got the rebound. 


He would lead the ball up the court down three. Varejao would set a high screen but Jamison would provide the help defense to stop the potential shot. Instead, it would lead to Anderson rolling and seemingly have an open quick bucket in the paint, only to be ruined by Agent Zero poking it out of his hands to save the game. 


Gilbert wasn’t losing Game 2. 


Eddie Jordan slowly made adjustments to the Wizards offense with the realization that the Princeton Offense was not working. The floor became slowly more spread out and Gilbert would see a lot more isolation opportunities. Meanwhile, Mike Brown didn’t do sh** because why would he? He had LeBron James.


Washington would start off their first home game hot and more importantly, LeBron James wouldn’t. Once again Caron Butler would start the game off strong going 4-for-6 from the field and surprisingly, Antawn Jamison wouldn’t suck to start a game. The 26-19 lead to start the first quarter, LeBron James possibly falling under the pressure of play-offs, it felt like the story most expected.


LeBron would proceed to score 16 points in the second quarter only to be matched by four Wizards scoring 21 points. LeBron was roaring but the Wizards were keeping a safe distance. And 8 point lead felt like enough. 


Caron Butler returning to earth in the 3rd quarter didn’t help. 2-for-8 from the field was not good. More importantly, Brendan Haywood would rack-up 3 fouls and Eddie Jordan would push Jamison to the five. A total of  34 points would be scored in the third quarter and the game would be tied. [LeBron would also have a ridiculous pass that I still don’t know how he was able to pull it off](https://youtu.be/RpiMtLxh7NA?t=360). Also, Big Z travelled on that play and it doesn't get talked about enough. 


The 4th quarter would feature the match-up we all were expecting — Gilbert versus LeBron. Eddie Jordan’s shift to a man defense wasn’t much of a basketball decision as it was a respect decision. Mike Brown, still didn’t do sh** to adjust. 


For the next 12 minutes, no one else on the court seemed to matter. The Wizards would set-up the half court for Arenas to do his thing, the Cavs would stick to their already spaced system and give the ball to LeBron to do this thing. Arenas’s 17 and LeBron’s 14 points was  battle of greatness that would bring the game down to the wire once again.


The final 45 seconds went like this:


LeBron would bring the ball up and immediately draw Jared Jeffries to the left side of the court. Jeffries would look over his shoulder to realize he was all alone, like he was back in Indiana. Attempting to force LeBron into a help defense situation, he would succeed as LeBron went right. The help defense would come, LeBron would crow step —even though childhood me remembers him pushing off and a travel—and LeBron would finish at the rim.


95-93, Cavs.


Gilbert would get the ball and draw the defense to the right. Pushing the pace, he wanted the quick bucket but more importantly, Anderson Varejao was standing at the top of the key in ’No Man’s Land.’ LeBron would panic to stop the drive, instead committing a blocking foul, and Arenas would get the and-one. 


96-95, Wizards. 23.4 on the clock.


James again would bring up the ball and Jeffries would follow him up the court. Seeing the iso situation once again, Gilbert would fake the threat of a double-team—when in reality, he appeared to have been telling Antonio Daniels, to switch with him. Daniels did not. LeBron would get the high screen and Jeffries would switch with guess who, Antonio Daniels. 


Drive down the middle, fake left, Daniels eats the pum, go right, Michael Ruffin cannot defend. It doesn’t get easier. 


97-96, LeBron. 


With 5.7 seconds left, an actual brilliant play was drawn up by Jordan and staff. Gilbert would take out the ball. Jeffries would start from the low post but flash to the wing. Gilbert would inbounds and based off the situation—could wrap around to the basket for a contested lay-up or pop out for the jumper. Hughes would stumble attempting to guard Arenas and Agent Zero had the look outside. All of the space in the world, feet set, it would lip out. Jamison would fight for the rebound but couldn’t get it. 


It wasn’t a good start to the weekend.


Game 4 was once again a must-win game for Washington. Gilbert didn't help—starting 1-for-9 in the first half. Down 57 to 46 in the first half, things needed to change. Arenas would change his outfit—literally his shoes, shirt, jersey, shorts, tights—and Eddie Jordan simply said that he would not call any plays and just let his players play. 


It worked.


The Wizards would outscore Cleveland 60 to 39 in the second half. LeBron would have 7 turnovers, 4 offensive fouls and complain about the officiating post-game, commenting on how he felt his aggressive play was being taken away. What he didn’t know was Eddie Jordan had spoken to the refs about LeBron’s aggressiveness during the off-day. 


LeBron would have his first frustrated play-off experience with his team, as they would be unable to take advantage of the Wizards crowding LeBron on defense. Gilbert's 28 points in the second half, 20 points in the 4th quarter would bring the series even but the wraith of LeBron James was coming.


And Gilbert was still Gilbert, quoting the infamous Nike ads in post-game interviews: “This is LeBron's show, you know. We're just all witnesses.”


Returning back to Cleveland, everyone knew a war was coming. Whoever would win this game would more than likely win the series. And of course, it would have to go to overtime.


Arenas and James were matching each other bucket for bucket. When it wasn’t in their hands, you f**ked up as a teammate. With 33 seconds left in overtime, Arenas would strip the ball from Larry Hughes and get to the basket for a contested yet an easy lay-up, giving the Wizards a 1 point lead. With 30 seconds left, LeBron would bring the ball-up the court, this time on the right side, and while attempting to push by Caron Butler, he would draw the blocking foul. 


No one wanted LeBron on the line in the final seconds. Winning by free throws was bogus. He would hit both of them, one point lead in their favor.


Arenas’s turn, he would draw Hughes as far from the perimeter as possible, searching for the opportunity to trip off Hughes once again. Hitting him with a crossover and seeing an opportunity to go left, Arenas brought him to the paint only for Varejao to step in for a blocking foul.


No one wanted the game to end by free throws. Wizards go up 1 with 3.6 seconds left.


It wouldn’t end by free throws.


[LeBron James would would get the ball baseline](https://youtu.be/O_VRySsuR9E?t=63). The Wizards immediately collapse on the 21 year-old. They knew he would take the shot. Some how managing to push around Jamison and stay in bounds, he would lay it in.


“The Lay-Up."" 


Arenas’s 44 didn’t matter, Antawn’s quiet 32 didn’t matter. LeBron had 45 and the only bucket that mattered. 


Back to Washington, Gilbert and LeBron were ready for one final duel. Walking into the arena strapped, Arenas and Caron Butler would match Cleveland’s total for the first quarter while others accounted for 7 additional points. Donyell Marshall and LeBron James would respond with 18 points in the second, leading reducing their deficit to 1 entering the half. 


Despite a cold third quarter from LeBron and Larry Hughes,  27 points from both teams in the third quarter would set the table for the 4th quarter match-up we were all expecting: Flip Murray and Donnell Marshall versus Antonio Daniels and others. 


Yet during the 2 minutes of the fourth, the broadcast would return to its expected program of LeBron and Gilbert fighting to the death. 


1:35 to go, Wizards up 4.


LeBron gets Gilbert Arenas into an isolation match-up on the left side of the court. Gilbert, being the elite defender that he is, fails to make LeBron go right following a jab-step and LeBron gets the easy 2 over the smaller defender.


Missed free throws from Jeffries, missed lay-up from Butler, Antawn getting blocked were met by  Ronald Murray 4 points in two possessions, along with trading free throws and Eric snow making free throws to give the Cavs a 3 point lead with 5 seconds to go.


With the ball in their half court, everyone knew Gilbert was getting the ball. [No one was expecting him to get the ball 28-feet away from the basket and drilling it](https://youtu.be/DgVM5VOWozM?t=420). 


There would only be 13 points made in overtime: 5 points from LeBron James, 4 from Caron Butler, 2 from Gilbert Arenas.


With the Wizards holding a one-point lead and 15.1 seconds left, the Cavs had to foul. They would have to foul Gilbert Arenas. Gilbert had already missed two free throws this game but was having a reality nice night — 36 points, 51.9% from the field, 11 assists. An 80.3% free throw percentage and the mindset of a Greek God, he would make this a three point game…Right?


[He would miss the first one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nfeSlgjKSw). Short. A common practice of Arenas and of those that get little movement from the legs in their form.


LeBron James would approach him, tapping his left shoulder as he prepared his routine. Arenas looked surprised—surprised that the young star would do this or surprised that the refs let this happen. LeBron would mutter the words that would shake his mental, something along the lines of, “If you miss this, you’re going home.” He would miss his second free throw.


The Wizards would still be up one with 14.6 seconds to go. Gilbert would pick-up LeBron but LeBron wouldn’t be the one to take the final shot. One pass to Hughes, one pass to Damon Jones, alone in the corner. He would make the final 2 points of that game. Arenas would push the ball up the court, kick it out to an open Caron Butler but it would not go. 

---

The duel would happen two additional times, making it a back-to-back-to-back match-up in the playoffs— all of which went the Cavs way. The rivalry that was established by Larry Hughes would last because of the battle between two of the best. 


Doing my best Nick Young impression, [LeBron James ruined my life](https://youtu.be/fQwPKlflonQ?t=133). The rivalry that would mold my impression of the King will be remembered as him managing to out-duel the man that loved a good shootout.

1. Players “have to be taken out” when they are in foul trouble

2. Players should be “protected” from the chance of fouling out

3. Players in foul trouble are less effective

In my analysis, I found that these reasons are not backed up by the data. I included players who played at least 58 games and averaged over 25 minutes per game for the 2018-19 NBA season. I used the NBA standard definition of foul trouble, which is when a player has fouls equal to the quarter + 1. For example, if a player picks up their second foul in the first quarter, third foul in the second quarter, etc., then they are in foul trouble.

**Reason 1: Players “have to be taken out” when they are in foul trouble**

Commentators often say that players “have to be taken out” when they are in foul trouble. However, players don’t have to be taken out until they have six fouls, and not every team takes their players out when they are in foul trouble.

This table shows the percent of the time that teams took their players out for the rest of the quarter immediately after picking up a foul that put them in foul trouble: [https://imgur.com/ivObifd](https://imgur.com/ivObifd)

Teams had different strategies for dealing with players in foul trouble. The Grizzlies took their players out for the rest of the quarter 67% of the time, while the Rockets only took their players out 13% of the time.

Teams that usually took their players out in foul trouble still had several players foul out. They did not have significantly fewer players foul out than teams that usually left their players in.

**Reason 2: Players should be “protected” from the chance of fouling out**

Fouling out is a pretty rare occurrence. Players only fouled out 1.5% of the time. And on average, players fouled out after playing for 29 minutes, which was just 1 minute less than their average playing time for games when they were not in foul trouble.

This table shows how often players fouled out in different foul trouble situations: [https://imgur.com/eXXjN9g](https://imgur.com/eXXjN9g)

Of course, the percent of players that fouled out is artificially lower because teams play their players less if they are in foul trouble. This table shows the probability that players would foul out if they played their regular number of minutes: [https://imgur.com/CGxhMCH](https://imgur.com/CGxhMCH)

This table shows that taking players out in foul trouble is usually not a good investment. For example, if a team left a player in after picking up their third foul in the second quarter, they would have had only a 12.8% chance of fouling out.

*Redefining foul trouble*

The current definition of foul trouble calls for taking players out when they have fouls equal to the quarter + 1. In the first quarter, this means players should be taken out when they have only a 9% chance of fouling out.

I think a good definition of foul trouble would be “when a player is more likely to foul out than to not foul out of the game.” This table shows the probability of fouling out for players who play 30 minutes per game with an average foul rate: [https://imgur.com/7lA2Qmf](https://imgur.com/7lA2Qmf)

Based on this table, a typical player is in foul trouble if they have 4 or 5 fouls in the first quarter or 5 fouls in the second or third quarter.

**Reason 3: Players in foul trouble are less effective**

Another common argument for taking players out who are in foul trouble is that they will be less effective.

*Player stats*

This table shows the stats per 48 minutes for players in foul trouble, compared to the stats for the same players when they were not in foul trouble: [https://imgur.com/ZQEBxNl](https://imgur.com/ZQEBxNl)

The stats are above the NBA average, such as 23 points per game, because star players played the largest number of minutes in foul trouble. For example, the players that played the most minutes in foul trouble were Paul George, James Harden, Devin Booker, Andre Drummond, and Russell Westbrook. Players played 7,909 minutes in foul trouble, which is about 165 games.

Players had similar stats when they were in foul trouble and when they were not in foul trouble. Their points (+3%), rebounds (+7%), and shooting percentage (-2%) were all pretty similar.

Players were more effective at drawing fouls (+22%) and shooting free throws (+36%) when they were in foul trouble. Players had lower assists (-11%), so it looks like players were more focused on driving to the basket and trying to draw fouls when they were in foul trouble. 

It also looks like players played less aggressive defense when they were in foul trouble. They had slightly lower blocks (-5%) and steals (-6%), and they picked up significantly fewer fouls (-28%).

*Team stats*

We can also look at how teams fared when they had a player in foul trouble, compared to those same teams when they did not have a player in foul trouble: [https://imgur.com/zc5arAX](https://imgur.com/zc5arAX)

When my team had a player in foul trouble, my team scored 2.5 more points per 48 minutes. This makes sense with the individual stats table, where players scored more points when they were in foul trouble. Possibly, teams left players in if they thought the player would be effective on offense.

The other team scored 1.6 more points per 48 minutes when my team had a player in foul trouble. Players in foul trouble were less aggressive defensively, and it looks like the other team was able to take advantage of this by scoring more points.

Overall, my team outscored the other team by 0.8 points per 48 minutes when my team had a player in foul trouble. The benefit on the offensive end outweighed the player’s defensive liability.

**Takeaways**

· Most NBA teams take their players out when they pick up a foul that puts them in foul trouble. However, players with fouls equal to the quarter + 1 are unlikely to foul out. 

· A better definition of foul trouble would be when players have at least a 50% chance of fouling out. This would be when players have 4 or 5 fouls in the first quarter, or 5 fouls in the second or third quarter.

· Players are still effective when they are in foul trouble. Their offensive production increases, but they are less aggressive defensively. Because of the low probability of fouling out when players are in quarter + 1 foul trouble, players could play more aggressive defense and risk picking up more fouls.

Overall, if a team’s goal is to play their best players the most number of minutes possible, then foul trouble should not be a big consideration unless a player picks up several fouls early in the game. Teams like the Rockets and Celtics already approach foul trouble like this, so hopefully other teams will catch on and make foul trouble a thing of the past!",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,80207,public,self,The Foul Trouble Fallacy: Teams shouldn’t take their players out when they are in foul trouble,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/fj89cy/the_foul_trouble_fallacy_teams_shouldnt_take/,some_ads,7,,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'tDiyPJQul5oA0jPPleOWYs-ZFcMBn2mzXWxmE1TxynA', 'resolutions': [{'height': 135, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/W6wzHFIZxMRYK1QttI72tkP2dpCuw5oaJoA22rmv7mY.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecd0a7e113ec12528624ccae914f5a42b4c5d322', 'width': 108}, {'height': 270, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/W6wzHFIZxMRYK1QttI72tkP2dpCuw5oaJoA22rmv7mY.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfdfa2437796cb63ae8153dd97e3e85c750eb926', 'width': 216}, {'height': 400, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/W6wzHFIZxMRYK1QttI72tkP2dpCuw5oaJoA22rmv7mY.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e20879a4113f76c0ae2c0517cf9a3ef0ec157d1', 'width': 320}, {'height': 800, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/W6wzHFIZxMRYK1QttI72tkP2dpCuw5oaJoA22rmv7mY.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae7add3e04f133b8cb0c24af1413b923c4401203', 'width': 640}, {'height': 1200, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/W6wzHFIZxMRYK1QttI72tkP2dpCuw5oaJoA22rmv7mY.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93ab4f8884f2b09a8f68f470520b9615f53f0a07', 'width': 960}, {'height': 1351, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/W6wzHFIZxMRYK1QttI72tkP2dpCuw5oaJoA22rmv7mY.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9196427ff978bdc58f6ed924283b575e8e71257', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 1640, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/W6wzHFIZxMRYK1QttI72tkP2dpCuw5oaJoA22rmv7mY.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=32df4dbb62ba18efab7b5b90f2b06dbfe794387f', 'width': 1311}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,

I think this can be a good experiment with the unfortunate circumstances but can be a possible change to the postseason. To summarize DInwiddie seems to suggest the league should have all 30 teams compete in this playoff tournament like the NCAA or World cup in soccer. It looks like the best of 7 series was still be applicable in the normal rounds.


  For me, I think this  is worth a shot cause if the league starts it is possible it is in late June, July, or August. The tournament can speed things up for next year.

  I think fans will not like having all teams compete and if this tournament idea is pernament, fans will think playoffs will be lessened and it's prestige is nothing. For me though, for years we all hear how the 7th or 8th seeds are pointless and how teams who go for these seeds are worser off in the future than teams that suck and get picks. So for me if fans think it's pointless to have the 7th and 8th seed, why it is the difference if everyone competes then?

  If we do this NCAA style tourney, The Bucks and lakers face the two worst teams in their conference. Then you go to second seeds and they face the 14th seeds in their conferences. The first round is maybe sinlge elimination or best of three sine single elimination increases chances for a major upset. Then for next round it is basically the usual first round of the playoffs, I think you can go back to best of 7 or maybe just go best of 5. Then you know what goes next, but when I look at this format it doesn't change much the old playoff format other than allowing the whole leagie to compete.


  Does it make the playoffs less prestigious? You can say that, but like I said all I hear is fans hate on 7th to 8th seeds unless they are young adn talented teams. For one this new tournament, increases the prestige of making the semifinals, could potentiall stop the tanking issue in a way, and also this makes the road for the championsip even a bit more difficult. I don't think it makes upsets easier as well ause those bad bottom tier teams will have it rough to even make it to the second round.

  I understand the complaints and I think this is a one time thing for this year for now. I think all teams deserve a shot to play some games this season when they hopefully and should resume, cause theywere all affected and all plaers deserve a shot to play the sport they love. Still, NBA has wanted to change a bit and you look at the conference tourneys in basketball, WOrld CUp soccer, or even look at European soccer leagues, all those leagues don't even have a playoff anyway. So for me allwoing all teams to compete could help all teams with profit and even if a team is terrible like 22 wins, the experience in a playoff like atmosphere will always be great for a team and players as they go on. People will say players are judged off of playoff experience so i think it's fair that all can prove they are winners like a Trae Young who hasn't played yet and needs to prove that.

  Again what matters the most is the finals anyway and how you perform.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,80195,public,self,What do you guys think of this playoff idea or something similar for this season?,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/fj2xr4/what_do_you_guys_think_of_this_playoff_idea_or/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fact that the season may be totally over really is something else and pretty crazy. I feel like what’s been overlooked is just the impact this has and just how much it exactly changes things. For instance, some things to consider with the season potentially ending for good right now:

Lebron, playing with a true contender, loses out on a year as he chases Jordan’s six rings. I know it’s Lebron but he’ll be another year older next season, AD is free agent, and guys like Rondo, Howard, Bradley, and Green will be older and/or free agents. It’s tough seeing this as a lost year for the king as he tries to cement his legacy.

The Celtics young core was making a lot of progress as we watched Tatum start flirting with superstar numbers and Brown showing a big jump. Hayward looked much better and has been healthy for the most part. He has a player option this summer and it will be interesting how that plays out now. This team relies a lot on youth and it’s a hit to the gut seeing guys like Grant Williams, Robert Williams, etc. lose out on playing time and valuable experience when there is hope on them being role players on a contending Celtics squad in the coming years.

Giannis and the Bucks were playing great ball only to see their season cut short. With the best record in the league and GA having an incredible season, it’s tough seeing the season cut short for them. I don’t know if they were good enough to win it all but their record certainly looked good enough. With GA a free agent after next season and stressing his desire for a ring, it has to hurt knowing they won’t even get a chance to try their luck at a ring this year. What happens if they don’t win it next year or even worse take a step back? Are they watching an hourglass right now with the GA situation?

The Clippers were looking scary good and had managed to put together quite a team. Unfortunately luck never seems to be on their side and it looks like they’ll have to wait until next year. I’m not sure of the contract/cap situation with them but they have a lot of big names on their roster and imagine it will be tricky this offseason bringing everyone back. 

The Rockets are another year older and were starting to show some signs of trouble as of late. The core is locked up so there shouldn’t be much change with their starting 5 but the bench is another story. Can they improve it this offseason or will they get even thinner? Harden and Westbrook are likely entering the later stages of their primes so these are crucial years for the two. Do they go into next season with the same mindset and game plan since they didn’t get to see their small line up in the playoffs?

Vets who were considering retiring after the season or ring chasers who jumped on with a contender. Nothing too crazy here but it must be difficult or at least strange for guys like Vince Carter to see their careers end like this or for guys who took less money/smaller roles for their sacrifices to result like this.

There weren’t really any teams that got totally screwed by the shortened season via last minute trades or signings. For example, we didn’t see a team give up draft picks or young players for a star player in hopes of going for a ring. Imagine a scenario where the raptors trade for Leonard to go for it all only to have the season cut short and the star player leave in the offseason. There were however some smaller moves where I’m sure teams would have liked to see how things played out (Wiggins, Drummond).

Obviously some things are bigger than sports and more important. I think the league ultimately made the right decision but it’s interesting to think about how this will impact the league moving forward. Sort of like a domino effect, I wonder how much this shortened season with no champion will alter the landscape of the league.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,80184,public,self,What’s At Stake With A Season Cut Short,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/fip37s/whats_at_stake_with_a_season_cut_short/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But LeBron James has had his years of having the best stats and team success while not winning MVP. Yes, Giannis is having a historic season in terms of stats. But let's take a look at how big a role narrative plays in awarding the MVP award.

If we base everything from stats, why didn't Westbrook win the MVP in his absurd 3 straight years of averaging a triple double? Because the first was a great story. The next 2 times had a different narrative already.

In 2010-2011, James had the highest PER in the NBA but lost the MVP to Rose, who became the youngest winner ever. Age was a factor in the narrative then. But people refuse to accept age as a factor this season.

Steve Nash won 2 awards with people debating that there were more dominant players who had much better stats like Kobe Bryant. But those were the years that PHX started the ""8-seconds or less"" style offense that has revolutionized today's game.

Narrative matters, folks. Like it or not, stats are not the only thing the voters look at. They try and find the difference between ""Best Player"" and the ""Most Valuable Player.""

A team that I was mesmerized by growing up — partially because Jason Kidd being the cover art for *NBA Live 2003* which was the best of the franchise, partially because of the weird ESPN commercial with Jason Kidd at the free-throw line, blowing a kiss to his wife that later became awkward following Kidd admitting to assaulting his wife. 


Their story is forgotten due to the competition they would face, however they arguably deserve at least a  paragraph in the history books.


—


We always hear the phrase, “Thank God social media wasn’t around when I was growing up and maturing.” Jason Kidd probably agrees. A tremendous point guard, his young career centered around the thought of being the savior of a program. He would go to  his home college of Cal Berkley—a surprising choice given the recent history of the program. He would get Lou Campaneli fired as a freshman, only to bring in  future bag-dropper Todd Bozeman. He would go second overall — which probably pissed him off — to a Dallas Mavericks team that produced the worst record the year prior. He would help the team rebound to a 36-46 record and he would earn an all-star spot in 1996 however would also be traded due to the devil’s thruway between Kidd, Jim Jackson and the Dallas Maverick coaching staff.


He would join a Phoenix Suns team where again, he would immediately make an impact. The team’s record would improve by 16 games thanks to the small ball approach taken on by Danny Ainge, who would produce a line-up with Jason Kidd and the rookie Steve Nash. But Nash only played 10.5 minutes a game in his first season and it was mostly the work of Kevin Johnson, Sam Cassell and Jason Kidd. 


However, the Phoenix Suns would never achieve the success the team desired. Tinkering with line-ups, making adjustments to the back court to find the right match for Jason Kidd, they simply couldn’t create the perfect line-up. it would frustrate members of the team, frustrate the front office and more importantly, frustrate Jason Kidd once again. The final straw would be reached as Kidd would be charged with domestic abuse during the 2000-01 season, the Suns would need to hit the reset button and Jason Kidd would be shipped off to New Jersey. 


Meeting Jason there would be, Kenyon Martin in his second year, rookies Richard Jefferson and Jason Collins and then the two veterans Kerry Kittles and Keith Van Horn. The group of misfits would immediately go from laughing stock into championship contenders, something that was baffling at the time. 
  

Byron Scott structured his team around the ‘Princeton Offense.’ Allowing Kidd and Kittles to run the offense in tandem while also have a finger in nearly every single play was best for business. It would later lead to frustration, because Jason Kidd couldn’t shoot the ball so when he was in off-ball situations, he was limited, but that’s a different story for a different time. Keyon Martin was showing why he was a first overall pick and Jefferson was a spark-plug while showing potential as a scorer. Even though, [his attitude on the court wouldn’t be well received as he was still a rookie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZME4lTWBHY).


The Nets would enter the play-offs, seemingly going through the gauntlet of tough teams — and the Charlotte Hornets. 


They would start with the Indiana Pacers, in an incredible series that would feature a battle between Martin and peak Jermaine O’Neal, as well was Kidd versus Reggie. I still keep a recording of the Game 5 double-OT match-up, featuring incredible plays like the [Reggie Miller dunk to tie](https://youtu.be/FyEuOlPwGN4?t=3639) or the [ridiculous buzzer beat to tie off the Richard Jefferson’s choke job](https://youtu.be/FyEuOlPwGN4?t=3027).

Their second series against Baron Davis and the Charlotte Hornets wouldn’t have the same battle however would also feature an amazing game 5.

And then, the conference finals that was overshadowed by that western conference finals--you know the one, they would outlast the Boston Celtics in 6 games—fighting off comeback after comeback attempt. It was also cemented by the biggest shot in New Jersey Nets’ history — [the Keith Van Horn 3-pointer from the top of the key in game 6](https://youtu.be/FyEuOlPwGN4?t=3027).


But then, their magic disappeared. In the finals, what felt like would be a story booking ending to their turnaround  year, the Los Angeles Lakers would smash their dreams. Shaquille O’Neal would outmatch the big men on the Nets, Kobe would do Kobe things. The Nets simply were defeated by greatness. It was a gut punch, a reminder that not every story has a happy ending. They were exposed about their weakness in the 5 and the Princeton Offense looked out of place.


It felt like things would get better though. They were young, green and more importantly, Jason Kidd was entering free agency the next summer so they had to succeed or else he would leave. The lack of a better big men was  supposedly fixed by a 36 year old Dikembe Mutombo, Richard Jefferson would take on a bigger role with the team, it felt like Lucious Harris was still one of the best — if not the best — 6th man in the league, and they also had Brian Scalabrine. It had to work. 

They would still win the Atlantic division and once again, felt like they could make another run. In the play-offs, it felt easier. They would fight off the Payton - Cassell - Redd Bucks in six, shaking some of the nerves off in what was a rocky series. They would sweep their next two opponents - a Detroit Pistons team that was a year away and a Boston Celtics team stuck in, “should we blow it up mode or what should we go after” territory. 


Then, came the San Antonio Spurs. 


The then ‘Twin Towers’ system around Tim Duncan and the David Robinson had been needing a breath of fresh air. Despite winning a championship in 1999, they would struggle against modern views on the game. They would lose to Phoenix in 2000, the Lakers in 2001, Lakers again in 2002. They were simply outmatched.


However, new faces would make their appearance into the mold of things between 2001 and 2002—the names we associated with the dynasty: Manu, Tony Parker, Bruce Bowen, Stephen Jackson. While still displaying a resemblance to their old game, it would be with a fresher look and Tim Duncan would finally play the center--even though no one wants to admit that Tim Duncan was a center. 


In what felt like a Japanese wrestling match, both teams would battle with technical bliss mixed with physical play, paying homage to both the old and the new style of the game. [Dikembe would put the moves on Tim Duncan](https://youtu.be/XZBtA32q9rI?t=192), [Duncan would respond by nearly murdering the old man](https://youtu.be/kmpZh1l0hV4?t=108). But at the end of the day, the Nets would fall short once again. Tim Duncan would carry the Spurs across the finish line while Dikembe could barely walk. Jason Kidd would wonder what else he could have done to bring a title to New Jersey.


That off-season would change the future of that franchise. Jason Kidd would chicken out of a move to San Antonio in the final seconds, opting to sign a massive contract to stay while ownership attempted to sell the team. Dikembe would be bought out of his contract and the team would bring in Alonzo Mourning to fill the hole. However, it would be start to the internal discourse that would plague the team for years to come as Mourning didn’t appreciate getting rid of Dikembe. Then again, Alonzo Mourning wouldn’t see the court enough to understand the possible impact of Dikembe due to Mourning’s kidney disease complications.


With a slow start to the season, previous frustrations that were hidden through their play-off hot streak came back to light. More specifically, Jason Kidd was once again unhappy with his head coach. The Nets would do their best to hide the internal struggles to the media and would once again, look to re-create a spark. They were leading the Atlantic division prior to the departure of Scott but once again, they got hot—probably because Kenyon Martin would be playing for his resume and Richard Jefferson once again was improving his game. 

Despite being 14 games back from the Eastern conference leaders, the Indiana Pacers, they were once again the 2-seed—because of the stupid conference systems—but were arguably the third best team behind the Detroit Pistons. They would make quick work of the New York Kicks in a sweep. And then again, they were up against a team with an elite center.


The 'men-at-work’ Pistons were as previously mentioned, a year away last year. This time, they were here to play. Games 1 through 4 would all feature blowouts — with teams winning by a margin of 15 or more points. In what was a brutal, physical series all around the Nets would lose in 7 games. It was such a bad beating in game 7 that Larry Brown opted to sub in Darko Milicic during the final minutes — having only played 7-minutes in 4 games that post-season. 


The team would never reach the same heights. They would trade away Kenyon Martin — which irked Mourning yet again—but would bring in Vince Carter following his Toronto campaign to get out. . However, due to a Richard Jefferson injury, Carter and Kidd would fight for a play-off spot but felt like a wasted attempt. They would return to the top of the Atlantic division in 05-06—which felt like one last gasp for an finals opportunity for the franchise. 


Vince Carter and Richard Jefferson would struggle to find their strokes in the play-offs, the magic of Jason Kidd seemingly was beginning to finally fade. And it truly felt that this was the era was over. 

--
A team that reached heights no one truly expected never could finish the deal. No one expected them to be contenders yet they were — which makes their story so tragic. A team with gifted guards and underrated forwards failed to complete their roster with the 5th man they truly needed. In an era where a dominant big man was needed, they simply lacked it and never found it.


Yet the spectacle of watching the team was something I simply loved to watch. The brilliance of Kidd, the spectacle of Richard Jefferson, the power of Kenyon Martin, the archetypal role player in Kerry Kittles and even the years of peak Vince Carter. Its a brutal reminder to go all-in with a favorable hand and favorable circumstances and a brutal reminder of what happens when you miss your window. It was a series of unfortunate of events.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,80154,public,self,"An Overwritten, Too Long Remembrance of the Early 2000s New Jersey Nets — One of the NBA’s Most Forgotten Great Teams",0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/fi8nuu/an_overwritten_too_long_remembrance_of_the_early/,some_ads,7,,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'T-1lgSLwLFpTMCWtSF6Ltv6ZSa6AjGM_4G6ico6pPk4', 'resolutions': [{'height': 81, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/JaoqtjGWVYzV9tLxOj9vcasi7ujOouHzfAbq8048o8w.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fb2c35445386e300ac55d4b8a859970ae7e70df', 'width': 108}, {'height': 162, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/JaoqtjGWVYzV9tLxOj9vcasi7ujOouHzfAbq8048o8w.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=069855a0902c4c0217058fe1c6602bee6a63d321', 'width': 216}, {'height': 240, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/JaoqtjGWVYzV9tLxOj9vcasi7ujOouHzfAbq8048o8w.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4aafa232aab85d80ef4b054f1fdd55b91d3c529c', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/JaoqtjGWVYzV9tLxOj9vcasi7ujOouHzfAbq8048o8w.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=477493fc480a37f6eff3b01fe7d94d300b5d16f9', 'width': 480}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,

Before anyone says anything, the criteria for positions is ""if they were plopped into every team in the league, which position would the most teams start him"" so that's why they have Ben Simmons listed as a PF. I'm not sure I agree, but that's the logic. Also, players in the same tier ""theres an argument to be interchangeable in the rankings.""

Anyway, Nate's justification for having him so high is that ""if given the choice, more teams would prefer to have Zion Williamson"" and that while its still questionable how he'd perform in the playoffs since he's never been there, there are already questions around Ben Simmons in the playoffs so it evens out. Zion is arguably already a top 10 offensive player in the league, and Ben Simmons requires such a weird lineup with so many teams.

Danny disagrees and thinks Zion has been so terrible defensively that he doesn't deserve to be in this tier.

Former all star Joe Johnson was on the roster, and for a team that has struggled to bring in fans to a new arena, a player like him, however ineffective this late in his career, could at least drum up a little bit of hype around a team devoid of it. 

But keeping him meant releasing Christian Wood, an undrafted big man out of UNLV who flashed some promise towards the end of last season with the Pelicans. This context is only necessary because the Pistons are quite possibly the least talked about team in the NBA, and Wood is having quite possibly *the* breakout player of the NBA right now after the Pistons elected to cut Johnson in favor of him. 

His playing time was sporadic when the season began, but as he’s gotten more of an opportunity, it’s become obvious Christian’s offensive game is basically an NBA front office’s wet dream as far as a big men are concerned. He’s an ELITE (truly elite, he ranks 95th percentile as a roll man) rim runner with great athleticism, can shoot the 3 at an above average clip, and is a monster rebounder. 

What’s most impressive above all else is how Wood has elevated his game to another level in spite of an abysmal supporting cast. Since Andre Drummond was traded, Wood is averaging 22 points and 10.2 rebounds per game on 54 percent shooting from the field and 37.3 percent shooting from three-point range. He is doing this while defenses key in on him, given that the team’s secondary scoring options on a given night are Bruce Brown and Svi Mykhailiuk. 

The Pistons have been mired in the depths of mediocrity for quite some time now, and throughout that time they’ve let a couple of “diamond in the rough guys” get away, most notably Khris Middleton and Spencer Dinwiddie. Christian Wood will be an unrestricted free agent this coming offseason, and they should be doing anything and everything in their power to retain him.

I do like the Clippers. Obviously their defense is going to be elite in the playoffs, and they have a very talented offense. But since Kawhi and PG13 have joined, I’ve been saying they still need a center. I got into an argument with my brother, and he proved exactly why. He says the Clippers can stop every big man except Joel, Jokic, AD, Giannis, and the like. But most of those big men are also competing for a title so.. that shows the need for a center right?  Harrell is very talented but small for his position, and Zubac is good but young.  They just picked up Noah but I’m not sure if he’ll be a Dwight Howard or Javale McGee for them just yet.  

I am not completely sold on them getting past the Lakers in the WCF. If they pulled it off, I’m taking them over every team in the East except the Bucks. The Sixers would have been included, but the coaching has been horrendous. The Bucks are a very long team and as good as Kawhi is, I don’t see him shutting down Giannis two years in a row. Even with PG’s help, I still feel like the team as a whole is good enough to keep it close. The Clippers’ bench is also very good, but the Bucks have a good bench too. I’d predict that finals matchup going to 7 games, but really wouldn’t know who to pick as the winner. 

Last time I checked the books, the Lakers are the favorites. I don’t think Lebron will allow another finals loss if they make it, no matter who the match up is. I have also been rooting for them since the end of January, but they’ve been elite all season. They also have at least one X-factor outside of Lebron and AD every night.

So, this is rather a deep dive down the rabbit hole and kind of a random ass theory, but after watching two of the game’s brightest stars struggle to shoot free throws this year (LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo), I got to thinking as to why this is the case.

Now in all fairness, LeBron has never been a great free throw shooter and neither has Giannis. At their peak, they’ve both been hovering around league average.

After watching them at the line, thinking about their shots and releases, and free throw shooting in general, I’ve derived a conclusion that I believe holds some weight.

Both Giannis and LeBron came into the league as fantastic physically gifted players. While they are not necessarily comparable in skillset, I’ve found an interesting comparison in their free throw shooting.

Throughout LeBron’s first 11 seasons (last Miami year), he shot 74.7% from the line which was just below the average (75.58%).

Across Giannis’ first 5 seasons, he shot 74.6% from the line and league average was just above 76%.

Well, both players past this point have seen significant dips in their free throw shooting numbers. LeBron in the 6 seasons since has only shot 70.4% from the line and shot below 70% for a season twice, and Giannis has shot 68.6% from the line, notably only shooting 63.3% on the current year.

So what’s the comp?

***Significant gain in muscle mass, specifically in the shoulders.***

LeBron really started to bulk up towards the end of his time in Miami and once in his second stint with Cleveland, he continued that trend. As he’s gotten older his game has become much more oriented around strength and power rather than the quickness and speed he had when he was younger, a pretty natural progression. If you look at pictures of LeBron prior to leaving Miami, and how he’s evolved in his second Cleveland run through to LA, it is impossible not to recognize the difference in muscle mass; He seemingly morphs into Karl Malone.

Giannis, has evolved from all limbs his rookie year, into a dominant physical force. He most notably made a significant jump in terms of his sheer size and muscle around 2016/17 and really grew into his body the year prior to his MVP season. If you really go back and look, the biggest difference has been in his shoulders over the last year/year and a half.

Now, I’m not trying to incite that this is the root cause of all their issues in shooting. But, I think it is a definite impact on their shooting. Shoulder size, form, and muscle can greatly impact shoulder rotation as well as flexibilty and all-around motion.

Shoulder motion and rotation is key to shot release and form, so having a change over time in that motion would almost certainly impact the shot.

I think the mental aspect of shooting free throws has also been a certain issue, primarily with Giannis it seems recently. However, I would argue that the mental aspect has become an issue due to tweaking of shot form due to unintentional collateral from physical changes.

**In Layman’s terms:** Because there was a change in the physical ability of their shoulder’s/shooting form of free throws, and it negatively impacted their shooting percentage’s, it then has gone on to impact their confidence/mentality in terms of taking free throws.

This is all just a theory from someone who watches way too much basketball hahaha, but I think it’s a very real possibility. I plan on looking into other cases to bolster the support of this or maybe even prove it wrong. I’ll certainly update when I have more info.

The team is built around him... just like every other star, Giannis team is perfectly made for him and his skill set but they are a good team without him on the floor.

Lebron dominates the ball, yeah because we want jr smith or Kyle kuzma running the offense. 

Lebron hand picks all his players.. yeah I’m sure that’s why instead of just goin to do gm work he cried about not having a back up playmaker in Cleveland after kyrie left. He made sure to go after Jordan Clarkson, deron Williams, Jose Calderon and all of them. Every superstar has input on some players signing btw if you guys didn’t know. Also when kyrie was there and he was letting kyrie run the offense they still couldn’t keep a lead with lebron off the floor. Warriors went up 10 and lebron couldn’t rest for a minute .

Why does nobody ever blame the coaches , aren’t coaches supposed to draw up plays for players especially if you have shooters like those cavs teams did. 

Now to this lakers team, this team isn’t even built around bron like that. I promise if you watch games and not just look at stats you’ll see what I’m talking about. Two big lineups have been restricting his scoring since the season started. If anything this lineup is built around AD since he doesn’t like playing the 5.

Using Jacob Goldstien's PIPM metric, I made a visualization comparing the top 40 current NBA salaries (a minimum of 1000 minutes played this season), to their PIPM.

Giannis is a complete outlier, as his value is outperforming his current salary by a wide a margin. CP3 is without a doubt one of the biggest surprises, as he is currently playing up to par to his lofty contract. Going into the season there was major skepticism about his health, age, declining play on the court and housing the 2nd highest contract in the league, but he has managed to only miss one game this season and has his OKC Thunder in the playoffs as the 5th seed.

Giannis was dominant the whole year on both ends of the floor and led his team to a 60 win season. Meanwhile, Harden had one of the beat scoring seasons we’ve ever seen. He dragged a far worse supporting cast from the 14th seed to a top 4 seed in a much more competitive West. In the end, Giannis ultimately won MVP; I personally felt that Harden had a better season, but I accepted that certain voters had a different definition of what the award meant. Giannis was the best player on the best regular season team in the league, and it was nice to see him win MVP.

This season, it looked like we were in for an even better race. Harden was averaging nearly 40 ppg and was even better than last year. Meanwhile, Giannis also took his game to another level and the Bucks looked even more dominant than last years squad. During the first couple months, however, the media and fans were quick to dismiss Harden’s MVP case. Even I was inclined to agree; as strongly as I felt that Harden should have won last year, Giannis was having a better season this year on a better team and I agreed early on that the MVP was his to lose barring a serious injury. 

However, lately there’s been this strong push out of nowhere for LeBron to win MVP over Giannis. I seriously cannot think of a single good reason why LeBron should win over Giannis. He’s having a worse season on a worse team despite getting to play with a better co-star. 

LeBron: 25.7/7.8/**10.6**, 58.1% TS, 25.9 PER

Giannis: **29.6**/**13.7**/5.8, **60.8% **TS, **31.7 **PER

LeBron has been a very good defender this year but Giannis is a DPOY tier defender and is a tier above LeBron. Giannis’s team is better this year. Anthony Davis is far superior to any of Giannis’s teammates. 

The only case for LeBron to win over Giannis is that he is by definition “more valuable” to his team - the argument being that the difference between the Lakers with and without LeBron is greater than the difference between the Bucks with and without Giannis. 

First off, the reason they struggle without LeBron is because the team is literally built to perfectly suit him - he has another top 6 player as his co star and he is surrounded by good shooters who also play great D. 

Second, it’s appalling that the media is moving around the goalposts so much just to crown him MVP. Harden had more value to his team last season than LeBron does this year. He had worse teammates and averaged better stats while carrying his team to a top 4 seed - they were a game away from the 2nd seed. 

Harden last year: **36.1**/6.6/7.5/**2.0**/**0.7**, **61.6% **TS, **30.6** PER

LeBron this year: 25.7/**7.8**/**10.6**/1.2/0.5, 58.1% TS, 25.9 PER

Harden had a better season and had worse teammates. By every measure, he had more value and had a greater impact on his team winning than LeBron last year.

Harden lost last year’s MVP to Giannis by a good amount. Giannis is having a better season than he did last year and LeBron is having a worse season than Harden did last year. Earlier this season when Harden was averaging 39 ppg and was better than last year, people didn’t even consider him for the award. Why are people even considering LeBron to win MVP?

I understand that some people don’t like Harden that much and that a ton of fans love LeBron. But it’s unacceptable for actual awards voters to base their decisions for such significant awards based off of which player they like more.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,79975,public,self,It is ridiculous how the media changes the definition of MVP and moves the goalposts every single year to suit their narrative.

Hey everyone - in this med analysis, I explained Giannis’ left knee mild capsular tear, when to expect him back on the court, and if there are any risks moving forward. Thanks to the mods for letting me post.

Here’s a table of contents:

\- 0:00 Intro

\- 0:17 The injury

\- 1:45 Return to play (RTP) timeline

For those at work or the hard of hearing, I've transcribed subtitles on YouTube so sound isn't required.

Summary: Giannis suffered a ""mild capsular tear"" of his left knee vs the Lakers and is set to be re-evaluated after the Bucks current road trip. The capsule is a dual-layer connective tissue that surrounds the knee joint with the outer aspect providing stability and the inner providing synovial fluid to the joint. Typically, capsule tears are associated with other injuries, especially on the lateral aspect of the knee, referred to as posterolateral corner injuries. However, based on the diagnosis and Coach Bud's comments about ""best case prognosis"", this sounds like an isolated capsule tear and shouldn't keep Giannis out for a limited time. For example, Rudy Gay had the same injury and only missed one game. Based on the Bucks schedule, the Warriors game on 3/14 could be a good target. The one variable is if they get extremely conservative considering their lead in the ECF and title aspirations.

But I remember in college, my jaw would be on the floor multiple times a game watching him just purely from athletic standpoint.

Like where if you watch basketball, you just get a sense of what's possible--how high players can jump, when a lob pass is uncatchable, etc. And Zion would just routinely defy all of my expectations with those regards. Stuff like this play, where he just keeps going up and up and up [https://youtu.be/ozl\_I3byeMc?t=66](https://youtu.be/ozl_I3byeMc?t=66) would happen multiple times a game. Like this is independent of the other people on the floor.

Don't get me wrong, he's been amazing. And still incredibly athletic. And he's been an even better overall prospect than some of the most positive projections--for instance, no one expected his 3PT% to be this great right off the bat. But like purely from an athletic ""wow"" standpoint, I haven't had that experience watching him in the NBA that I had in college / high school.

I'm thinking maybe he's just being more careful and not playing as recklessly following the knee injury? But as a fan, it is somewhat disappointing.

So the scenario is this: GSW is going all in for another title next season while Curry, Klay, Dray are still in their primes, though weakened from injuries. GSW is basically hard-capped and can't really improve the roster much: but they still have the Iggy $17m trade exception. I think Kelly Oubre Jr. would be a perfect candidate for their trade exception as he or Wiggins would both be great 6th men, and Oubre is an expiring n the 2020-21 season.

Phoenix is ready to move forward with their core of Booker, Ayton, Bridges, and to a lesser extent Cam Johnson. Bridges, Johnson, and Oubre all are in the same position and let's operate under the scenario Mikal Bridges keeps impressing as a starter for the remainder of the season (has been playing very well since Oubre's injury). Phoenix has big holes for a starting PF and bench depth. I see this as a chance to get the most value out of Oubre now, and in addition not have to worry about paying him after the 2020-21 season.

Orlando suffers a similar issue of having too much talent at the PF position with Aaron Gordon and Johnathin Isaac, and it's known that they are not the best compliments with each other, 

&gt;[Orlando’s starting lineup of Nikola Vucevic, Aaron Gordon, Jonathan Isaac, Evan Fournier and Markelle Fultz are a great complement of talent that has not found a way to mesh consistently. The group has a +6.6 net rating this year and is one of the Magic’s best lineups. But it has let them down recently, especially late — that same group has a -11.6 net rating in the fourth quarter.](https://orlandomagicdaily.com/2019/12/20/aaron-gordon-and-jonathan-issac-must-step-up-orlando-magic-against-top-nba-teams/)

So for Orlando I see this as an opportunity to get the most value possible for Aaron Gordon via GSW being forced to pay the win-now price.

The trade based on these scenarios:

GSW In: 
*  F - K.Oubre Jr.
* PHX 2020 FRP
* ORL 2022 SRP (2nd)

GSW Out:
* GSW 2020 FRP
* F - E.Paschall
* G - J.Poole

PHX IN:
* F - A.Gordon
* C - M.Bamba
* F - E.Paschall

PHX Out:
* PHX 2020 FRP
* F - K.Oubre Jr.

ORL In:
* GSW 2020 FRP (most likely 3-5th pick)
* G - J.Poole

ORL OUT:
* F - A.Gordon
* C - M.Bamba
* ORL 2022 SRP

GSW Projected Depth:

Curry - K.Thompson - Wiggins - D.Green - Looney
6M: Oubre  -  ~10th pick 2020 draft  -  combo of Chriss - Lee - Bowman - 2nd round picks - minimums

PHX Depth:

Rubio - Booker - Bridges - Gordon - Ayton
T.Jerome/J.Carter/E.Okobo - C.Johnson - E.Paschall - M.Bamba ,  as well as ~10M in capspace to maybe obtain a better backup pointguard.

ORL depth:

Fultz - Fournier - 3-5th pick likely to be SG/SF - Isaac - Vucevic
Ross - Poole - ORL FRP/SRP - Aminu - Birch, as well as being completely cleared of Gordon's salary with taking minimal salary back

Thoughts? I feel like this could be a relatively realistic scenario. The trade I *think* works salary wise unless GSW actually can't get under the tax apron in the offseason. The website was missing GSW's 2020 FRP so I put a different one to signify that.

Just taking a look at the standings, we're seeing 5 good teams battle for 1 playoff spot

**8. Memphis Grizzles 32-32**

9. Sacramento Kings 28-35 3.5 GB

10. Portland Trail Blazers 28-37 4.5 GB

11. New Orleans Pelicans 27-36 4.5 GB

12. San Antonio Spurs 26-35 4.5 GB

Meanwhile on the east

**8. Orlando Magic 28-35**

9. Washington Wizards 23-39 4.5 GB

10. Charlotte Hornets 22-41 5 GB

Purely my opinion here, but the west race is a lot more intriguing and I'd rather see more of those west teams in the playoffs than the teams that will eventually qualify in the east.

However, next year it will arguably be worse. The West will have the following teams:

* Lakers
* Clippers
* Warriors
* Rockets
* Jazz
* Nuggets
* Pelicans (with a healthy Zion)
* Mavericks (with a maturing Luka)
* Grizzlies (Ja)
* Spurs
* Blazers
* An upcoming Kings team

That's 12 teams with a very solid upside. Meanwhile the east will have at least 7 good teams, but parity will likely be an issue again.

Is there any way the league can address conference parity? Here are my stabs at it:

**The bottom two seeds in each conference playoff bracket are picked by overall record instead of conference standing..**

So for today's playoff picture that would be:

7 Seed West - Mavericks 39-25

7 Seed East - Memphis Grizzlies 32-32

8 Seed East - Brooklyn Nets 28-34

8 Seed West - Sacramento Kings 28-35

Pros of this approach

* Simple way to pick teams
* Doesn't add additional games

Cons of this approach

* Still very limited in its scope
* Could cause issues with travel distance if too many teams from one conference qualify

Another possible idea:

**A mini group-format tournament: the 7-12 seeded teams in each conference play in a 12-team tournament over a week.** 

* split the 12 teams into 4 groups of 3, drawn by overall record. 
* Each team plays each other twice, the 4 group winners make the playoffs and placed in the 7-8 seeds by record (first) and closest distance (if possible). 
* The tournament would create 4 additional games that would be played over a week-long span while the teams that already make the playoffs rest. 

Pros:

* adds more drama to the season as teams fight harder to be in the top 6 seeds and avoid the group tournament. Meanwhile the 7-12 seeded teams will play harder at the end of the season to get the best group draw to make their competition in the tournament easier.

Cons: 

* 4 extra games while the playoff qualifiers rest. The teams that qualify will be at an even bigger disadvantage. But nevertheless it still adds drama/excitement to the overall playoff picture which is good for the NBA. I don't think anyone is on the edge of their seat watching the 28-35 magic jog into the playoffs because everyone behind them is terrible.

Just taking a look at the standings, we're seeing 5 good teams battle for 1 playoff spot

**8. Memphis Grizzles 32-32**

9. Sacramento Kings 28-35 3.5 GB

10. Portland Trail Blazers 28-37 4.5 GB

11. New Orleans Pelicans 27-36 4.5 GB

12. San Antonio Spurs 26-35 4.5 GB

Meanwhile on the east

**8. Orlando Magic 28-35**

9. Washington Wizards 23-39 4.5 GB

10. Charlotte Hornets 22-41 5 GB

Purely my opinion here, but I'd rather see any of those western teams in a playoff matchup over the Nets or Magic.

However, next year it will arguably be worse. The West will have the following teams:

* Lakers
* Clippers
* Warriors
* Rockets
* Jazz
* Nuggets
* Pelicans (with a healthy Zion)
* Mavericks (with a maturing Luka)
* Grizzlies (Ja)
* Spurs
* Blazers
* An upcoming Kings team

That's 12 teams with a very solid upside. Meanwhile the east will have at least 7 good teams, but parity will likely be an issue again.

Is there any way the league can address conference parity? Here's one possible idea:

* The bottom two seeds in each conference playoff bracket can just be picked by overall record rather than conference standing. So for today's playoff picture that would be:

7 Seed West - Mavericks 39-25

7 Seed East - Memphis Grizzlies 32-32

8 Seed East - Brooklyn Nets 28-34

8 Seed West - Sacramento Kings 28-35

Another possible idea

* A mini-tournament: the 7-12 seeded teams in each conference play in a 12-team tournament. They split the 12 teams into 4 groups of 3, drawn by overall record. Each team plays eachother twice, the 4 group winners make the playoffs and placed in the 7-8 seeds by record and conference (if possible). It would be 4 additional games that would be played over a week-long span while the teams that already make the playoffs rest. This adds more drama to the season as teams fight harder to be in the top 6 seeds and avoid the group tournament. Meanwhile the 7-12 seeded teams will play harder to get the best group draw to make their competition in the tournament easier.

Of course this could cause issues with travel distance if too many teams from one conference qualify, but some NBA teams are already  disadvantaged for travel distance in playoff scenarios (west coast teams e.g. Portland, Golden State, LA) and that issue is considered insignificant.

How does this change your projection of Zion as a defender in the NBA ? (My thoughts below)

First off , to be clear this isn’t a hate post by any means. But one of the most interesting open questions about Zion Williamson is whether he would more successfully translate to the NBA as an interior defender/small ball C (ala Draymond) or more of a strong forward who can defend wings, or maybe something else entirely. Playing defense in CBB is so different from the NBA and its hard to project how players will develop. 

So far , over this small sample size it appears Zion has struggled to deter shots at the rim when playing center. Furthermore his current block rate of 1.2% would pale in comparison to players such as Draymond Green (2.9%) or Robert Covington (2.3%) who have made a living as small ball Cs. 

Why? Well one of the secrets about being a rim protector is that vertical leap only matters to a certain point. NBA players are taught to go into the chest of a shotblocker on drives, because once you hit them in the chest the big man will recoil from the contact and can’t time their jump with you. Thus the best shotblockers have a long wingspan and standing reach, so they’re able to use verticality and contest shots without needing to elevate that high. Draymond and RoCo were blessed with 7’3 + wingspans which simply can’t be replicated by jumping ability. 

This is why I believe that Zion, despite having otherworldly athleticism that can cover up for a lot, may ultimately be limited as a pure rim protector due to his middling wingspan/reach. 

What do you all think? Can Zion achieve still DPOY type of defensive potential as a small ball 5? Would he be better as a forward defender guarding big wings like Lebron/Kawhi/Simmons/Tatum etc? Or maybe we can just chalk this up to rookie struggles and still believe he can develop into that all-around generational defender?",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,79880,public,self,Opponents have shot 41/50 (82%) when Zion Williamson is the primary defender at the rim.,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ffh2go/opponents_have_shot_4150_82_when_zion_williamson/,some_ads,7,,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'qYDjYycWqO5ydC4dJMwSiyZA-yPHkTLley0KYgXloU0', 'resolutions': [{'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/XvbJQoSuMWGdftlzvbYmeo57pomdfQZr3BtxQ-HUsls.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e1c9ac16d1b3ad99276d5d495e209d5d293a2d0', 'width': 108}], 'source': {'height': 140, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/XvbJQoSuMWGdftlzvbYmeo57pomdfQZr3BtxQ-HUsls.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=9723be52d88cf327807d1f140df11199472e9770', 'width': 140}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,

To solve this, I took the NBA title probabilities of four different websites for winning the NBA title ([538](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-nba-predictions/), [Teamrankings](https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/), [BPI](https://www.espn.com.au/nba/story/_/page/BPI-Playoff-Odds/espn-nba-basketball-power-index-playoff-odds) and [Stats Insider](https://www.statsinsider.com.au/nba/futures)), and weighted them according to (rough) past accuracy and intercorrelations with each other. I eventually gave weights of 37% to 538, 24% to Stats Insider, 19.5% to Teamrankings, and 19.5% to BPI (note how they are both 19.5 percent because their title odds are very highly correlated, so I took the 39% that would be for one of them and split it between the two). For the playoff odds, I threw out Stats Insider (because they don't provide playoff odds) and gave 538 a weight of 50%, and Teamrankings and BPI weights of 25%. The weighted title odds and playoff odds results I got were:

Bucks 37.0% title, 100% playoffs;

Lakers 20.2% title, 100% playoffs

Clippers 18.2% title, &gt;99% playoffs

Rockets 5.6% title, &gt;99% playoffs

Celtics 4.5% title, &gt;99% playoffs

76ers 4.7% title, &gt;99% playoffs

Raptors 3.1% title, 100% playoffs

Nuggets 1.4% title, &gt;99% playoffs

Mavericks 1.3% title, &gt;99% playoffs

Jazz 1.0% title, &gt;99% playoffs

Heat 0.8% title, &gt;99% playoffs

Pacers 0.3% title, &gt;99% playoffs

Thunder 0.2% title, &gt;99% playoffs

Magic 0.1% title, &gt;99% playoffs

Nets 0.1% title, 95.0% playoffs

Pelicans 0.1% title, 40.5% playoffs

Grizzlies 0.1% title, 29.4% playoffs

Portland 0.1% title, 9.9% playoffs

Spurs 0.1% title, 6.6% playoffs

Kings 0% title, 13.2% playoffs

Wizards 0% title, 5.0% playoffs

Bulls 0% title, &lt;1% playoffs

Suns 0% title, &lt;1% playoffs

Timberwolves 0% title, &lt;1% playoffs

Pistons 0% title, &lt;1% playoffs

Warriors 0% title, &lt;1% playoffs

Knicks 0% title, &lt;1% playoffs

Hawks 0% title, &lt;1% playoffs

Hornets 0% title, &lt;1% playoffs

Cavaliers 0% title, &lt;1% playoffs

From the above, it seems clear that while the Bucks are leading the title race, there are a couple teams that, while a tier below them, could challenge them, mainly the Lakers and the Clippers.

And I would argue that this helps balance the variations in the Bucks/76ers/Rockets/Clippers odds from source to source. I'm going to leave these odds here for reference.

He's part of the reason I've become so invested in the NBA throughout the years and why conversations comparing players is so intriguing to me. LeBron is an enigma. No other player has been able to keep up his incredible production for 17 straight years (that I can recall at this moment). At times he's accomplished what many believed to be impossible, be it making 8 straight finals, coming back from down 3-1 in a finals series, and what is to be the basis of this post, making the finals in 2018 with a roster that was completely retooled mid season.

LeBron beat the Oladipo led 5th seed Pacers, the DeRozan and Lowry led 1st seed Raptors with the reigning Coach of the Year, and the extremely young Celtics that were nonetheless blasting their way through the playoffs in one of the more surprising runs of the last decade. Who else, be it a current player or a historical legend, would be able to pull of this same playoff run?

As for current players, I think the list is very short. Aside from a few players I would be hesitant to name many who I believe to be capable of reaching the level LeBron did that playoffs. The only people I'd feel comfortable picking would be:

1. Kevin Durant. One of the greatest (If not the greatest) scorers of our generation, I believe Durant would be able to generate huge point numbers with the ball in his hands 90% of the time. He'd also most likely thrive on a jumpshooting team where most of his teammates remained at the perimeter and allowed him to go to work or pass out in the case of a double team or an opening.

2. Kawhi Leonard. A lot of noise is made of the overall talent of his supporting cast during his Raptors playoff run, and this is of course true, but it is undeniable there were large stretches during this run where he was forced to play hero ball and be the one guy they could rely on, especially during the 76ers series. I believe with the improved passing ability he's shown recently he'd be able to find the open man with much more accuracy than he's been known to do throughout his career, and thus would be just able to push through the tough competition he'd have to face without the quality of supporting cast he's used to.

3. Stephen Curry. This is my last choice I'd be willing to bet on, and probably my most controversial choice. I'm basing this mostly on what I saw from him on teams before the warriors were seen as the best team in the league, so pre 2014-15. These teams he played on were far from the quality most know of the warriors, and yet he led them to high 40s to low 50s in wins, a playoff series win against tough a tough Denver team, and close series against the Clippers who were surging in 2014 and the eventual finals runner up Spurs in 2013. These series' were arguably tougher competition than anyone he would face in a hypothetical 2018 rerun and he was within very small margins of winning each series he lost. Curry on that 2018 team would open up the inside for players like Kevin Love who struggled to shoot the ball from the perimeter that playoffs and allow him to go to work inside. He also has the capability to take over games when he has to, as seen from his mostly one man job throughout the 2019 finals.

In terms of historical players, I won't write great long paragraphs as I did for current, but I believe Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Larry Bird, Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, and perhaps many others who I have definitely forgotten.

Its not a terrible movie but watching it literally minutes before Kenny Atkinson and the New Jersey Nets parted ways didn’t seem like just coincidental timing.


Atkinson joined the Nets back in 2016, with a resume of being from the coaching trees of Mike D’Antoni and Mike Budenholzer. Recognized as one of the better head coach prospects in the league, his experience in player development with the Houston Rockets and studying under offensive gurus, it made all of the sense in the world why the ‘desperate for resources’ Nets wanted him—he could possibly work with nothing.


For his three and a half seasons with the Nets, he would accomplish what was expected of him. He would turn around a group of lackluster talent and unproven stars into a possible Eastern Conference contender. With the signings of Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant, we all thought it would lead them to the promise land. Until it didn’t. 


People are going to be quick to blame the newly introduced star players but what — hear me out — if there were legitimate reasons for why the talent and the coach may not have worked out and Sean Marks is stopping the inevitable?


It first begins with the 5-Out Motion offense. 


A common offense used when teaching the game of basketball and infamously used by Bob Huggins, it focuses on position-less basketball, and as a basketball camp of mine coach once called, “an offense for players that suck.” All five players will start around the perimeter and with the use of active screens and cuts, open up the paint and create outlet opportunities. It can be a difficult system to learn but once a simple understanding is developed, its solid. Its the foundation is what we see in most modern NBA offenses.


Atkinson’s take on the offense wasn’t much different from the standard 5-Out system. This was partially because the lack of presence in the 5 and Jarrett Allen, once drafted, taking some time to develop. But rather than focuses on catch-and-shoot opportunities, Atkinson focused on the drive. The Nets has been Top-4 in drives-per-game since Atkinson has taken the helm. This is partially due to the usage of high screen versus keeping the five off in the corner. 


What’s also surprisingly weird is how poor the team shoots in catch-and-shoot scenarios, ranking in the bottom quarter of the NBA for the past four years. Because if you think about it, you would hope that the wing could be accountable if the ball is kicked out. Joe Harris alone should bring the Nets at least to the top-half of the league.  


The 5-Out Motion Offense also needs a ball dominant guard and can often takeaway possessions from other members on the floor. Kyrie Irving ranks 10th in usage rate this year, D’Angelo Russell ranked 10th in 2018-19 and 16th in 2017-18. The system benefited both in different ways — Russell found his game and Kyrie was able to re-find his game. And this is fine -- because we know Kyrie and Russell are good at the game of basketball.


But for others, it wasn’t necessarily their cup of tea. Caris LeVert has been much more comfortable in isolation systems—as well as Spencer Dinwiddie. While both have been able to succeed with their talent, it could be argued a different offensive set could suit them better.  And because of the position-less basketball aspect to the game, it has stunted or halted the abilities of Jarrett Allen and hindered the reasons why you bring in guys like DeAndre Jordan. Because you aren’t necessarily setting up a pick-and-roll scenario, it can confuse your big man on an offensive possession—see nearly every single DeAndre Jordan high screen to open a possession that distorts the spacing of the offense. Brooklyn ranks 25th in turnovers per-game because of inefficient spacing. 


On the opposite side of the court, there isn’t much to discuss. They, like most teams, have taken on a soft-zone system. With Jarrett Allen on the court, the team does limit their opponent’s ability to score at the rim, ranking towards the best in the league in related statistics. However, they also have the question mark of having the third lowest steals-per-game, something that you don’t necessarily expected with a soft-man. The lack of great perimeter defensive has lead to the mid-range jumper becoming even easier for teams. 


But even in all of this discussion, we’re not seeing any improvements. And people will mention that Kevin Durant isn’t playing this season, Kyrie Irving tested the waters with the team but is likely done this year with his injury. Over the four years under Atkinson, the Nets improved their field goal attempts (+5 per game), three point attempts (+6.4 attempts), 2-point field goal percentage (+1.9%), total rebounds (+4.6 per game) and overall points per game (+5.1). They're seeing their first decline in overall performance this year. In the context of the injuries, seems legit. However, in the context of their dream’s and aspirations, it may not be good enough.


Mark Jackson was infamously let-go from his position as head coach of the Golden State Warriors after ownership felt he wasn’t the guy that could make the most use of the talent that was brought in. The Warriors were right. Instead of the lazy offensive system implemented by Jackson, Steve Kerr’s motion offense would bring the most out of Steph Kerry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. Jason Kidd was kicked out of Milwaukee for Mike Budenholzer. We're witnessing that story.


And its even more understandable with the NBA having a relatively high turnover ratio of head coaching gigs—with the average coach lasting between 2-and-3 seasons before decisions are made regarding their future. 


Kenny Atkinson deserves all of the credit in the world for what he was able to accomplish with the Brooklyn Nets in his time with the team and he will likely get a job in the near future — which was kind of nice from Sean Marks and Brooklyn to speed up  that process. If we remove the context and focus on what is in front of us, it all makes sense.


The Nets made the playoffs one time in four years, the progression of the team halted this season and the team could arguably be reaching its apex within the next 2-seasons. Its understandable that they want to be in the best position possible, likely bringing in a coach with play-off experience, for guidance. You want an experienced pilot to guide you through a storm versus a relatively green pilot. 


In his one play-off series as a head coach, the team was eliminated in an incredibly winnable series against a poorly coached Philadelphia 76ers line-up. Despite winning Game 1, his lack of experience showed and his plan to improve from that time never came to fruition. To put it bluntly, it feels like that even with his improvement and development, he was reaching his apex with the organization. And its a shame because in the history books, we won’t write Kenny’s name. We’ll write the person after him.


He has created the foundation and gathered the pieces but someone else will make the needed change. It could be the decision of how Jarrett Allen and DeAndre exist, it could be how does LaVert get more time in the spotlight, it could be Kevin Durant simply existing. We’ll just have to wait and find out.


Tyronn Lue is the likely candidate and it would make all of the sense in the world to bring him in. And if they do, we may be recognizing it as an improvement. You don’t rest easy in professional sports, you always want to improve.

Some ""lived up"" to the hype, others not so much and many have also gone on to have long NBA careers. 

With that said, if you had to create a starting 5 **that would be successful in today's game** using these guidelines, how would you lineup play out?

&amp;#x200B;

1. To make it  simple, imagine you are the GM of a team and every single high school player that came out was eligible to be drafted all together. All you know about the player is their hype, pre-draft grades/assessments and ability as they were **before** being drafted.
2. Also, how you felt about the player if you remember the headlines, hype etc. Maybe you agreed or thought the player would be a bust and was being drafted way too high.
3. You don't need the traditional PG, SG, SF, PF, C lineup, any combination you feel can succeed in the NBA today and possible win it all.
4. Again, the player's actual play in the NBA has no bearing to this question. Only their hype and what you thought of them at that time.

&amp;#x200B;

For me:

**Lebron James -** **Guard - St. Vincent- St. Mary**

Pretty easy on this one, I was still in Jr. High in Ohio when all the hype and news started coming out about Lebron. The hype was truly real with him. Being on national televised games and being heralded as the next Michael Jordan was certainly an insane level to live up to. He was on ESPN and many other channels, also appearing SLAM Magazine alongside Sebastian Telfair was quite the thing to see. He was pushed as a point guard with the size of a power forward that could play multiple positions. Going into the 2003 NBA Draft, he was the clear number 1 pick and was eventually picked there going to the Cleveland Cavaliers and the rest is history for him.

&amp;#x200B;

**Jonathon Bender - Guard - Picayune Memorial High School**

I admit, I might be a bit biased being a Pacers fan, but the amount of potential Bender given how the league was back in 1999 was tremendous. I was very happy with the trade that got him to Indy and had high hopes for him. He would later play with two other high schoolers, Al Harrington and Jermaine O'Neal. He was listed as a 7ft athletic shooting guard or small forward, depending on where you looked, with 3 point range, blocking capability and the ability to attack the hoop. He could also jump from the foul line pretty easily. Like Lebron, he won the Morgan Wootten National Player of the Year and also set the record for most points scored **(31)** in the McDonald's All-American game.

&amp;#x200B;

**Kevin Garnett - Forward - Farragut Academy**

A 6'11"" athletic forward with some guard skills wasn't very common as Garnett was coming into the league.  I was pretty young when he was coming out but I mainly just remember the amount of athleticism he had given his height. He had 18 points, 11 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 blocks at the McDonald's game and was named Most Outstanding Player. I remember him on the Sports Illustrated Cover titled ""Ready or Not..."" There were some questions about his strength and if he would be able to hold his own in the post but Minnesota eventually made the correct choice at number 5 in the '95 draft.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tyson Chandler - Forward/Center - Dominguez**

The 2001 draft is well-known for having a bunch of high schoolers being drafted, especially in the lottery and had one go first overall, Kwame Brown. With that said, the one that stood out to me the most was Tyson Chandler. He was on countless articles and magazines and was likened to Eddy Curry as both were similar size. The thin that separated Chandler was his athleticism. Yes, he was very raw offensively but was labeled as having good range for a big man and could run the floor. He averaged 26, 15 and 8 blocks as a senior and I felt it was the clear number 1 in that draft. I imagined him more like a Garnett than what he turned out to be but still had/is having a great career.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dwight Howard - Center - Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy**

The buzz surrounding Howard was pretty insane prior to the 2004 draft. We had just seen Lebron (and others) successfully transition into the league a year before but also saw some past top prospects struggle to find their own as well. Regardless,  Howard was widely considered the best high school basketball player and top prospect overall. He won numerous awards such as the McDonald's National High School Player of the Year and was also co-MVP with JR. Smith. He averaged 25 points, 18 rebounds, 8.1 blocks and 3.5 assists per game his senior year and was seen as a very athletic big who was a legit center. Some people likened him to a young Shaq, especially the way he could dominate.

&amp;#x200B;

**Honorable mention:** In order to make a better fit, I'd probably put a true point guard in the lineup.

The top two HS point guards from the 2004 draft were Sebastian Telfair and Shaun Livingston. There were other guards in the same draft that were also touted such as Devin Harris, Jameer Nelson and Delonte West. 

Between the two though, I always like Livingston more. The main reason was their size. Telfair had an unbelievable high school career in New York but had questions if it could transition easily to the NBA. Livingston's offensive game was very raw and didn't have a jump shot but was praised at having basketball IQ and the ability to already be a floor general. His size at 6'7 and long arms (Jay Bilas) was something you just couldn't teach. He was also Mr. Basketball in Illinois. As a result, my honorable mention, fill-in, would be **Shaun Livingston - Point Guard - Peoria**

As has been well documented over past months, the NBA’s TV ratings has dropped significantly over the past few seasons. There have been a lot of musings as to why this has occured/is occurring, but to put it bluntly, I squarely rest much of the blame on the current state of the way the league is broadcast.

Regardless of how you or I feel about player empowerment, player movement, increasing volume of three’s, the evolution of perimeter offense, and many other highly contested topics, you can rest assured that Chris Webber will tell you 17 times during the Rockets TNT game that their way of playing is flawed and they can’t win without a center.

I DO NOT CARE about your personal opinion of the Rockets, that’s not what we’re here to talk about.

The problem is the way in which the broadcast team talks about them and other teams (although I feel the Rockets are such a prime example). I’d be remiss to single out Webber; Jeff Van Gundy, Stan Van Gundy, and Mark Jackson are all capable of dishing out equally pessimistic takes.

Daryl Morey was recently quoted on First Take; *“Right now, if you tune into a lot of NBA telecasts, the announcers are hate-watching their own game. It’s crazy.”*

The Rockets front man is routinely outspoken, sometimes at to the detriment of his team (China,China, and China), ***but he’s fucking righ******t!***

I am a massive NBA fan. I dedicate hundreds of hours a month to watching, writing, talking, and doing all things basketball related. Yet, I find myself struggling to not hit the mute button when watching National TV games.

Regardless of my personal feelings of a team or the way they play, to hear broadcasters rip into them and nit pick every little thing they do, even the good things, is just an annoyance.

Think of it out of basketball terms.

Have you ever had a friend who’s always negative? It’s 65 and sunny, mid-March in Ohio (a rarity), but they bitch about having to wear a sweatshirt.

You bring a girl flowers, and she laments that you bought her tulips instead of roses.

A coworker constantly complains about the stupidity of upper management, but drags his ass at work all day.

This is the current state of NBA broadcasting!

Are there issues within the game? Of course. But, the continued degradation and belittling of the league and it’s players by the voices that are many people’s only audition of the NBA, is not only an embarrassment, but a hindrance to the state of basketball.

The broadcasters I’ve mentioned, as well as others I haven’t, are some of the most prominent ambassadors of the game. The majority of them are incredible basketball minds who can eloquently deconstruct plays and schemes in seconds. I grew up listening to the Van Gundy’s and Jackson and I learned so much from them. I love their knowledge and many of the takes they present.

But, if they’re not doing it with enthusiasm and excitement, why the fuck are they the one’s presenting the game? I’m an established viewer and nothing could drive me from the NBA except a tombstone. But, it sets me on edge, and I can only imagine the impact this has on casual or new viewers. If it’s their only real connection to the league, then those opinions are likely what they’ll take away from the game.

There’s a difference between critique and outright shitting on the game. Criticism is what helps the league change in a positive light, but there needs to be a balance, because right now, it’s off the rails.

Then came a very competitively built Raptors team which just sort of happened via trade. But they put all the right pieces around him midseason when they saw they were really doing well.

Now this seems the pinnacle of it all. Current Clippers is so well built, it has such an interesting combination of superstars, starters and bench pieces. This might just be me, and maybe we haven't seen LeBron go against a team in the playoffs which didn't have 4 all stars, for a long while. But I just don't see how anyone can beat the Clippers this season.

They have the components, Kawhi himself, Paul George with a huge chip on his shoulder (pun intended). I think PG balled out last playoffs, and now he has a legitimate first option. Their third best player, Lou Will is producing similar to Khris Middleton, who is Buck's no. 2. And then they have Harrell and Morris. These are just the offensive scoring pieces.

I can't really fathom them being beaten by any current NBA team. KD Warriors is the only one I can think of in the last decade.

Obviously, extremes are always wrong, but the consensus is or should be that overall in his career he has been a great defender, probably in the tier below the goat level ones, peaking from 2008 to 2013, overall declining year after year from 2014 until 2018, with a monster, all time level defensive effort in the 3-1 come back against golden state.

**This year, it's visible that his defense has resurged**, thanks to a great defensive personnel, a defensive minded coach, and a renewed motivation to strike back after last year's struggles and just having a title contending team.

**But exactly, how good has he been on defense?** Well, the stats basically tell the story that the eye test would suggest: he's an extremely good defender who is probably less committed than the average player, which still puts him at a very very good, borderline all defensive level.

Let's see:  
**Advanced traditional:** Def rtg: 105.5, 24th in the league, third on the lakers after AD and DH.  
Defensive Win shares: 3.5, 7th in the league  
DBPM: 1.7, 18th in the league  
DRPM: 1.97, 4th in the league  
Defensive RAPTOR: 93th in the league  
DPIPM: 48th in the league

**Now what really matters:**  
**Defensive on/off: -8.8, 96% percentile**. The lakers defend enormously worse when lebron is on the bench

**Tracking stats: the tracking stats are where it's at.** now these stats may appear strange, because they really paint a picture of a guy who is less active than most, but more useful than most.

**The bad:** Now, some people may know that, a stat that has a good correlation on the value of a defensive player, is the sheer amount of distance covered by that player during the length of a game, **Lebron ranks 76th with 1.04 miles covered, which is pretty low considering that he is 15th in minutes per game.** **His average defensive speed is bottom of the league low, being higher than just Jeff Teague, DeAndre Jordan, Chris Paul and James Harden.**

**Lebron defends just 7.8 shots per game, and contests just 4.0 shots per game less than the vast majority of player who play at least 25 minutes**

Now, **the rest, which is equivalent to saying the good:**

Using synergy: These playtypes are in order from most frequent to less frequent  
Lebron: **Overall defense: 94th percentile, EXCELLENT**  
**Spotup: 88th percentile, excellent**  
**P&amp;R ball handler: 96th percentile, excellent**  
**P&amp;R ball handler (big defender) 27th percentile, below average**  
**Isolation: 61th percentile, good**  
**Handoff: 69th percentile, very good**  
**Off screen: 73th percentile, very good**  
**Post up: 93th percentile, excellent**  
**P&amp;R roll man: not enough plays to be ranked or rated, but just 0.556 ppp**

As far as shot types, he's in the 90th percentile at guarding jumpers, 90th percentile at guarding shots around the rim which are not postups, and 95th percentile at guarding postups, just 34th percentile at guarding runners, which represent only the 5.8% of the shots he guards.

He's in the 78% percentile at guarding C&amp;Ss, 80% at guarding dribble jumpers. As far as distance, he's in the 90th guarding shots at less than 17 feet, 92th at guarding 3s, the midrange is where he struggles, ranking in the 35th percentile

**Hustle stats:** Lebron ranks 78th **(not percentile, just 78th)** in deflections, 25th in loose balls recovered, 42th in charges drawn

Observations: some defensive advanced stats can be too abstract, misleading and too luck dependent (in the fact that the opponent's ability to just make the shot despite his defender's good defense) and team, lineup dependent, but still the majority of the players with good defensive advanced stats really are good defenders and just a few not good defenders will have good defensive advanced stats, **but** **at this point, the impact metrics and even more the tracking stats can depict an amazingly good picture of a player's defense, just on the fact that all they do is register a player's involvement on the defensive end and his results.**

**Lebron James comes off as what he is, an extremely good defender, who can do well at defending many type of plays, but, for somewhat justifiable reasons, is directly involved in less defensive plays than many other players. In fairness, Lebron has also distinguished during the course of his career as a great help defender and defensive coordinator, someone who watches the situation and tells others what to do.**  
**Also, these stats are inflated by the fact that he often doesn't guard the oppenent's best player, but again, the overall picture is pretty clear.**

The first was a trade for Pacers star Paul George, sending their second leading scorer from the 2017 team Victor Oladipo, and promising young bigman Domantas Sabonis in exchange. The second was for all time great scorer Carmelo Anthony, sending Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott and a second (which became Mitchell Robinson) as compensation.

We know how these trades panned out. Anthony was a serviceable scorer who nonetheless stalled the offence and contributed little on defence, and was soon on his way to the Hawks in exchange for Dennis Schroeder. Paul George was great for the team and signed an extension, before leaving to the Clippers after an MVP worthy season in exchange for Danilo Gallinari, Shai Gilgeous Alexander and a war chest of draft picks.

However, what we don't know is what OKC would have looked like had these trades not taken place. Oladipo and Sabonis went on to have all star calibre seasons at different times on the Pacers. Kanter was an important piece for the Portland Trail Blazers in the 2019 playoffs. McDermott was (and surprisingly still is) a great three point shooter and spacing tool for multiple teams. 

I personally believe this growth and development still would have occurred had these players stayed on the Thunder. For Russ' entire tenure on that squad, spacing was their number one issue. Looking at the players who they traded for George and Anthony, Oladipo shot 37% from three the next season, McDermott shot 38%, Sabonis shot a respectable for a big man 35%, and we don't talk about Enes Kanter outside of the paint. George added spacing and an extra scorer, but Melo did nothing but act as an offensive black hole who didn't shoot the three well.

Imagine, if you will, a roster of Russ, Oladipo, Roberson,  Sabonis, and Adams, with a bench featuring the likes of Jerami Grant, Doug McDermott, Mitchell Robinson, and Terrance Ferguson. I don't think this team would be better than the PG teams right away, but I think with time the team could develop to be as good or better as the Russ/PG teams at their apex. Maybe even better than OKC currently is.

Hey everyone - in this video, I explain Kyrie’s right shoulder injury ordeal, the treatment roadmap that eventually led to his recent surgery, his return to play timeline, and how this will impact him moving forward. Thanks to the mods for letting me post.

Here’s a table of contents:

- 0:00 Intro
- 0:30 The injury
- 2:03 Treatment roadmap &amp; surgery
- 4:33 Prognosis &amp; career impact 

For those at work or the hard of hearing, I've transcribed subtitles on YouTube so sound isn't required.

Summary: Kyrie had been dealing with an ongoing shoulder injury that began in November and continued to cause him trouble. The injury was termed “shoulder impingement” which is a diagnosis of exclusion that means something in the glenohumeral joint is being pinched and irritated, typically during overhead movement. There was also some reports that Kyrie was dealing “thoracic bursitis” which is which a bursa becomes inflamed but those reports were never confirmed as true or false by the team. The team’s treatment roadmap began with conservative therapy - physio, when that failed moved to a cortisone injection (which has its own risks), and when that failed after Kyrie began to have pain again after returning, decided on arthroscopic surgery. The most likely surgery is a “subacromial decompression” in which the surgeon does multiple things to help clear out space and alleviate the shoulder irritation. The outcomes for a decompression are mixed but they are indicated for patients like Kyrie who have failed conservative means. The typical return timeline is roughly 3 months and he also has the luxury of the summer and a well-renowned Nets medial staff to really get back to 100% by training camp and team up with KD for next season, as originally planned.

In the recent [Lowe Post](http://www.espn.com/espnradio/podcast/archive/_/id/10528553) podcast with Kevin Arnovitz, Zach Lowe asks whether the Bucks should go for 70 wins.
He goes on to say that, of course they should since the MPG of their starters is not too high.

Later on in the podcast, he questions the Bucks' methodology of playing Giannis limited minutes and asks whether it is viable in the playoffs. He dismisses this, arguing that he ""plays so hard"" when he's out there.

Thus, I decided to look at the greatest regular season teams and their MPG, Distance logged per game, and Average Speed per game.

Obviously, these are not perfect metrics of activity, but I thought they may show some insight.

## MPG

MPG data was aggregated for the 2019-20 Bucks, the 2015-16 Warriors, and the 1995-96 Bulls (all teams with 70+ wins).

[Here is the plot](https://i.imgur.com/0nI6WWv.png)

Takeaways:
* MPG has (obviously) decreased over time
* MPG has become more evently distributed over time (e.g. Pippen and Jordan played *a lot* more than the rest)
* I feel like there is an exaggeration of how **hard** the Bulls played. It seems like Jordan didn't average too many more minutes than Green during the Warrior's season
* Yes, the Bucks have a very even and lowly distributed MPG - not just for Giannis! 

## Average Distance (mi)

Second Spectrum data was introduced in the 2013-14 season, hence distance data was not available for the Bulls.

[Here is the plot](https://i.imgur.com/cqHmJHF.png)

Takeaways:
* Curry and Thompson logged **so much more** than everyone else. One would expect all guards to have similar statistics, except Bledsoe and Matthews don't! I think this has to do with the Warriors guard-focused, 'free' style of play?
* Giannis doesn't really haul ass like Lowe was arguing. I know distance may not be the best metric, but it counts for something right?

## Average Speed (mph)

Second Spectrum data was introduced in the 2013-14 season, hence speed data was not available for the Bulls.

[Here is the plot](https://i.imgur.com/1wdousu.png)

Takeaways:
* Wow! Harrison Barnes does not get the credit he deserves haha
* Overall speed seems relatively the same
* Once again - Giannis does not outpace players by too much

## Overall
I think the whole wear and tear argument has been overstated **on both sides**. I don't think Jordan's Bulls played too hard and the current Bucks aren't resting too much. An opportunity to go for 70 wins trumps all, in my opinion, and the Bucks should gun for it.

Additionally, I think there is a myth on how hard Giannis plays when he is on the court. It seems he logs the same distance/speed as his peers and predecessors.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,79714,public,self,[OC] Should the Bucks go for 70 wins?

This year, with his great shooting, he helped in pushing Miami to 4th position in the East.

Some raw numbers and data to begin with. Robinson is currently third in the entire NBA league in total threes with 216, with only Buddy Hield (225) and James Harden (261) ahead of him. With Duncan 5% and 7% respectfully, more efficient than them at three-point shooting. We can say with great certainty that Robinson is already an elite three-point shooter. And what 43.8% efficiency from a three-point range looks like can be best seen with his [shot chart](https://i.imgur.com/DLRxUTY.png), which is ""Red"" in all 3 point areas. I think it's a pretty good accomplishment when your weakest 3-point shot is ""only"" 37.93%...

Another piece of information that is perhaps more impressive than previous ones is that Robinson takes 87.7% of all field goals in form of three-pointers!!! The first following player (who played some relevant number of matches with some respectable minutes) is Ben McLemore, with 83.4%.

The reason why I said that the Duncan is the definition of the term ""Catch and Shoot Player"" is that out of the 477 triples that he took, as many as 404 come from ""Catch and Shoot"" actions!!! In the [second graph](https://i.imgur.com/5LphTUq.png), I have shown 3-point attempts from Catch And Shoot actions, and as you can see, Robinson convincingly leads the league in this aspect, with 51 more shots than Bertans and Covington. And despite so many attempts, he maintains an average of as much as 44.8%!

The skill (which is also a type of ""Catch and Shoot"" action) that allowed him to make such a huge leap in this season, and also the play that makes the Miami Heat such a great offensive team, is the shot from the ""Hand Offs"". So, as the name implies, it's a simple basketball action where one player hands the ball to a teammate who runs past him. If you watched any of Miami's games or even the highlights, you noticed that this action almost always takes place in such a way that Bam Adebayo hands the ball to Robinson, and also making a pick which Robinson uses and shoots the three-ball immediately. As you can see in the [third graph](https://i.imgur.com/NsOD8Lc.png), Robinson has the most attempts in the entire league from Hand Off actions, 130 of them. And with that he has by far the highest eFG% of all players (who have more than 35 shots in total through the season). This percentage is 68.5%!! If you don't know what eFG% is, the full name of that statistic is ""Effective Field Goal Percentage"". The reason why it is called that is that it takes into account the fact that three-point field goals count for three points while normal field goals only count for two points. The simple formula for calculating this value is (FG2M + 1.5 * FG3M) / FGA. So this huge percentage of 68.5% tells us what we have already stated, Duncan takes a lot of threes, with very high efficiency.

Having already touched on the killer duo of Adebayo and Robinson, I looked at who the top three-point shooters in the league were getting passes from in [this chart](https://i.imgur.com/6WFpFnG.png). So the Adebayo-Robinson combo is the second most in triples scored, just behind Lillard and McCollum. In the 11th place, there is a Butler-Robinson combination as well. Since these are not ""official"" assists but shots hit after a pass from the passer, there is a possibility that the player did not take the shot directly but did some dribbling, so the scored basket was not assisted. But in the case of Robinson, we can pretty certainly say that almost all of them came for the REAL assist, as 95.3% of all Robinson's three-pointers are assisted!

To conclude this entire post, we can only say how hard work, will, persistence and desire pay off. Because Duncan Robinson was a player who started his college career at Division 2 college, then moved on to Michigan, where he was not the main star of the team, as shown in the 2018 draft when he was not drafted.

Before you guys all come at me with reasons why he won it and deserved I'm aware of that. He was a starting point guard on a playoff team. However he only averaged 10/3/4 and won it in large part due to Zion missing 50 odd games.  
  
Now some award in NBA history has to be the worst award and so for this post I'm not looking for least deserving but more so worst individual season to win a award. 
  
The awards I'm focused on mainly are season long awards with one winner such as MVP, 6MOTY, DPOY, ROY, MIP and COTY.  
  
This is opposed to awards where many players get selected such as allstar, All-NBA or all Defence teams.

***

Being able to score without dominating the ball is a skill that has typically been reserved for the NBA's most deadly catch and shoot players. Since the NBA started tracking touches (2013-14), Klay Thompson, Terrence Ross, and JJ Reddick have regularly been among the league leaders each season in points per touch. 

However, this season, there is a new face at the top of the points per touch leader board (minimum 500 total touches). 

##[Through 15 games, Zion Williamson has averaged 0.515 points per touch.](https://imgur.com/OqAxOQx)##

That's notable because every other player at the top of the points per touch leader board (Ross, Bojan Bogdanovic, Warren, Booker, Reddick, etc...) are either used as catch and shoot specialists or could be used as catch and shoot specialists. Zion Williamson is neither of those things. He has created a new player archetype that I like to call the ""Catch And Score"" specialist.  

*** 

Furthermore, players who have a high points per touch average typically are not also volume scorers. Which makes sense. Teams want their best scorers to touch the ball as often as possible which would in turn bring down their points per touch average. And yet, Zion is averaging 24.1 points per game. 

##[No one in the history of the NBA's tracking era has ever averaged as many points per game and points per touch as Zion at the same time.](https://imgur.com/Nyuk5Tk)##

The closest anyone has come to this is Brook Lopez during the 2013-14. In a season in which he only played 17 games due to a foot injury, Lopez averaged 0.515 points per touch (the same as Zion) and 20.7 points per game. Worth noting that Shabazz Muhammad had a three year stretch (2013 - 2016) in Minnesota in which he dominated the points per touch leader board, albeit while only averaging around 10-15 points per game. 

***  

Zion's ability to draw quick fouls, snatch offensive rebounds, and throw down lob passes all contribute to his high points per touch average. Right now his role on offense is simply to catch and score. 

As he develops a handle and becomes more confident in his ability to make two and three dribble moves his points per touch average will inevitably drop, but I believe we'll see his name at the top of this leader board for several more seasons to come.

First, start the season on Christmas and push the end of the season back. The NBA is going to take priority in just about every American city (there's a reason for this but it's controversial on NBA discussion forums) so playing multiple months during the NFL regular season is a terrible idea. Starting on Christmas means that many fanbases know their NFL team has no chance so they will be more likely to follow the NBA. Plus the NBA has done a great job of capturing Christmas day.

Second, my idea for deciding who to play. You play the teams in your division 4 times each, twice at home and twice on the road. This will hopefully help division rivalries which are very weak in the NBA. You play the rest of the NBA twice, once at home and once on the road. 

Third, and this will never happen, but have the playoffs all be best out of 3. This would create a massive amount of urgency that the NBA currently lacks. The first couple games of an NBA playoffs usually feels more like a regular season game. Some people say this isn't fair, my response is so what? Is March Madness fair? Is the NFL playoffs fair?

Many believe team will be up there and others believe that there ar many concerns. I think the team made a move that you take when opportunity presents itself and of course is a great chance to be a contender. The thing about finishing is it going to be that easy like a GS with KD or those Lebron and Wade teams?

  For one I believe KD will still be great like a top ten player to the levels of AD, Embiid, Westbrook, Dame, etc. he possibly can be top five and maybe even top three but the Achilles is something you can’t just ignore. KYRIe is also injury prone and for me will look tk always miss at least some games every year. 

  So for me Inreally feel the Nets need to not just play it safe. I really feel the Nets need one more player either an all star or star level player that can help KYRIe and KD our. 

 It is why I think the 2008 Celtics approach is something that should be considered. That 2008 team didn’t have that number one player like Lebron or Curry but they had too 10-15 players in PP, KG, and maybe Allen. I really think the Nets need a Ray Allen type player to compliment KD and Kyrie.

  I agree the Nets still have talent with guys like DInwiddie, Levert, and Allen. Still I feel like they just can’t expect all of them to just coexist. I think someone like DInwiddie should be kept with Joe Harris as they are very great players and DInwiddie was considered an all star to some. He could possibly be a third star too but He could also be not that really  strong one that could push them off the edge. I personally would keep DInwiddie if you could and he can still be insurance when Kyriewgets injured. But Infeel like the Nets should try to find either another scoring option or a really elite defensive type player or a big.

**Intro**


As the NBA becomes more and more of a three point shooting contest, talented shooting role players are becoming more impactful than ever. This year, Duncan Robinson (and to a similar degree Davis Bertans) are setting the new standard for three point shooting specialists as volume machines.

Robinson is currently shooting 43.8% from 3 on 8.1 attempts per game (13.4 attempts per 100 possessions, while Bertans is just behind at 42.4% on 8.5 attempts (13.4 per 100). While three point sharp shooters are nothing new, Robinson and Bertans are a new breed of super-shooter in terms of their volume and accuracy. 

Amongst players with reasonable numbers of games and minutes played, Robinson and Duncan trail only [Curry and Harden](http://bkref.com/tiny/NQmfe) seasons historically in terms of three pointers made per 100 possessions. Other role players dot the list, but Robinson and Bertans are historically efficient--setting a cutoff at [40% shooting](http://bkref.com/tiny/xm7dM) makes even clearer how much of outliers they are.

When naming all time great three point shooters we are drawn to accuracy first and foremost, and for good reason, since efficiency matters. But efficiency matters much less if you aren’t taking a ton of shots--a good three point shooter should shoot, and where Bertans and Robinson set themselves apart are in their volume. There’s a whole bunch of examples of 40% shooters in history, and a few crazy seasons coming close to or eclipsing 50%. But how many of these shooters were shooting 8 a game?



**Three Point Value Added Over Replacement**



We can measure the shooting value added by a three point shooter in a simple way. Assuming their shots were all given an average shooter, how many fewer points would be scored? This is the primary goal of a 3 point specialist--to hit shots other players would miss. This is a simple, but effective way at looking at the interplay between efficiency and volume by converting it to how many points would or wouldn't happen if the league average was shot instead.

This ignores gravity effects, and makes assumptions that the shots would be there if the players were changed. For extreme outliers like Curry this assumption doesn’t hold (he makes shots other players wouldn't make), but for catch and shoot specialists like Bertans and Robinson, I’m comfortable assuming that any random player could slot in and take those shots instead.



`ShotVolume * 3 * (PlayerAvgFromThree - LeagueAvgFromThree)`



**The List**



League average shooting on 3s this season (and in fact, almost every season for over 25 years) is .357. Here’s some players known for good shooting, known for extreme volume, and known for bad shooting, in this metric (active seasons bolded):

Duncan Robinson is near the top of a list filled with the best volume + efficiency seasons I could find from a whole bunch of historically renowned shooters. Per 100, he trails only 2012 Novak (which appears to be the all time greatest shooting value season), 2016 Curry (no surprise to anyone), 2016 Redick (a forgotten elite season!), and 2015 Korver (nearly 50% on volume!). Special shout out to Steve Novak, who appears to have one of the worst, and the very best, seasons of all time two years apart.

Duncan Robinson (and to a lesser but similar extent Davis Bertans) has provided one of the highest shooting value seasons of all time by a combination of volume and accuracy, while the most extreme outlier seasons rely on extreme accuracy over a relatively smaller number of shots. 

Duncan Robinson might not do much on the court besides take lots and lots and lots of threes, but he’s really, really good at that. He and Bertans are in relatively unprecedented territory as volume sharpshooters, and they are providing more value to their teams than most other three point specialists in league history.

But I was surprised to see how rare, and how dominant the 1/2 seeds are in the playoffs historically.

Also, winning the conf finals, 78.4% of teams have been a 1 or 2 seed, with 12.5% being 3 seeds.

And in 44 nba finals, only 7 times has the winner not been a 1 or 2 seed (6 times a 3 seed has won, and once a 6 seed).

Houston takes more three point attempts than any other team in history, and Dallas's attempts are only outpaced by Houston's past three years. 

Dallas ranks as the worst team in opponent points off the fast break and Houston the fourth worst.

Both teams are above average offensive rebounding teams (especially Dallas) in spite of not having a big usually positioned in the paint -- probably because the opposing center is consistently drawn out to the perimeter instead of traditional box-out-and-grab-the-rebound centers. Missed three point shots ricochet, leading to a good chance the offensive team can get a second chance point by crashing the boards from the perimeter. Dallas is 3rd in 2nd chance points. However, it is well known that prioritizing offensive rebounding can lead to poor transition defense. 

The 5-out naturally leading to the guys in the corners being further from the opposing basket and unable to sprint back on defense until they see which way the offensive miss ricochets seems to compound the problem. Dallas has the added problem of not being elite athletically, so they get killed on the fast break.

Is this a perpetual problem of the 5-out offense or is this merely a situational problem that can be solved with better transition defenders?

After putting together a tantalizing 20-3 run from early December to January 27th, The Jazz have struggled to a 5-9 record since their incredible stretch. The past few years, Utah has had well documented offensive struggles in the playoffs. So the offense must be faltering again right?

Oddly enough, Utah's offensive rating has been roughly the same during their slide as it was when they started 32-13. 

The defense, however, has nosedived.

After boasting the 7th ranked defense in the league over the first 45 games, Utah has sunk down to **28th** the past 14 (106.2 DRtg to 117 DRtg).

While many have attributed Utah's earlier success to a weak strength of schedule (I don't entirely disagree) and surmised that stronger opponents have been too much for the Jazz. Many have also been sure that this team doesn't play with the same effort as year's past, and recently, that has been part of the problem.

However, I think much of Utah's defensive issues can be boiled down to lack of size. That sounds crazy right? They start Rudy Gobert, one of the true giants of the game. Utah's off-season roster changes, namely trading for Mike Conley and trading away Derrick Favors, greatly impacted the length and strength on the floor for The Jazz.

Favors' impact on Utah's defense has been largely underwritten due to the inverse impact he had on a stagnant offense that suffered from a severe lack of spacing. As the starting center in New Orleans, he has had a massive impact on their team defense.

He missed a large chunk of the beginning of the season due to injury and the death of his mother. With Jaxson Hayes and Jahlil Okafor soaking up the majority of the Pels' center minutes, New Orleans ranked 28th in Defensive Rating at 114.4. Since Favors returned on December 13th, The Pelicans have owned a 109.8 Defensive Rating, tied for 9th best in the league. He's a plus defender on the interior with enough quickness to switch on the perimeter occasionally without being a liability.

Obviously Gobert is one of the league's best interior defenders, but he greatly benefited from playing next to Favors. From the 2015/16 season through to the 2018/19 season, when both Favors and Gobert were starting together, Utah ranked no lower than 9th and was 3rd in rim protection efficiency twice over four seasons. They've dropped down to 18th this year. 

I will also note that lineups featuring both Favors and Gobert dropped in rim protection percentage the past two years, but I attribute that mostly to the difference in the wings playing next to them. Lineups still playing more traditional-sized wings rather than multiple undersized wings still held elite rim protection numbers.

Example: Last season's lineup of Donovan Mitchell/Royce O'Neale/Joe Ingles/Favors/Gobert had a 54.5% rim protection percentage which ranked in the top 15% of league lineups.

As the Jazz transitioned from longer wings like Gordon Hayward (who Favors and Gobert posted incredible defensive lineups with), Rodney Hood, Alec Burks, and Dante Exum their rim protection numbers have slipped which makes sense. While smaller and quicker guards/wings have allowed for better perimeter defense, they are also giving up many more drives to the rim.

When Favors was slotted next to Gobert, he routinely was able to stretch out to cover more perimeter oriented assignments allowing for Gobert to stick closer to the rim. Replacing Favors with Bojan Bodanovic, stretches Gobert out even further from the rim quite often. Bogdanovic is a decent perimeter defender, but lacks the strength and size to be a quality interior defender. 

Joe Ingles is a good defender, but also lacks the size to play the four credibly. Ditto Royce O'Neale, probably the second best defender on this team, but he's 6'4 so his defensive potential is automatically lower.

Gobert's defensive load and responsibility is MASSIVE due to the roster construction. The Jazz rely on him to be the best rebounder and defender on the floor at all times and that's a huge ask. Lacking the threat of another sizeable defender coming from the weakside makes it that much more strenuous on Gobert as a rim protector.  

I think this team can and will sort out it's defense, but I'm confident that this team no longer has the same defensive ceiling as they had in previous years.

I'd love any feedback or thoughts! I've been thinking about this a lot the past two weeks and it's interesting to see how the numbers stack up with the eye test.

Will teams start to trot out 5 guards/forwards in their starting lineup to prioritize outside shooting above all? Will the center position truly become obsolete? Will there be no more need for a big to have an inside-scoring skill set? 

I don't think so...not with so many talented bugs out there today, not all of whom are dominant from the outside. Embiid, KAT, AD, Jokic, Rudy Gobert's defensive prowess, and then guys like Capela and Drummond who are automatic double doubles. While they aren't knockdown outside shooters (some of them have the range), I dont think you can ignore that much talent and skill just because they aren't snipers. I do think we will see even more small ball lineups, and guys like Embiid and Gobert will get less playing time in close 4th quarter/guts of the game situations. I think we'll see a lot more shoot outs in close game situations. 

I think it's kind of impossible to make an entire position/skill set obsolete. To put it simply: a bucket is a fucking bucket; doesn't matter where u get it from. Elbow jumper, logo shot, transition layup, whatever. If you get more buckets than the other squad, you win.

But assuming Philly actually want to trade Al Horford, how much do the Hornets need to add to Rozier to acquire Al Horford? 

For salary-matching purposes, unfortunately we(Hornets) probably need to send Cody Zeller to the Sixers. He'd be a fantastic backup for Embiid, he's a good defender and great screener in the PnR, but he has value next year as an expiring, but above average NBA centre. And losing him is better than losing Malik/PJ/Miles/Jalen etc. But with Horford, I was personally hoping to have him and Zeller as our C rotation next year, as both would be amazing mentors for a guy like James Wiseman or Okungwu who Hornets may draft. 

Rozier hasn't been amazing for Charlotte, but his C&amp;S 3 point numbers are fantastic, he plays a lot bigger than his 6'1"" height(he is good at fronting in the post and rebounding), and in the Sixers system with better defenders around him he'd be more motivated probably. He used to be a good defender for Boston, and he's flashed solid defensive IQ this year; he's just a bit lazy at times and there are issues with his PnR defensive techniques and his tendency to gamble and overhelp.

Do the Sixers need more picks, maybe some seconds, going their way in this kind of deal? Should the Sixers be asking for one of the Hornets young pieces, and if so, which one specifically?

This year, I wanted to follow closely the aforementioned battle, without going too in-depth or with advanced stats, so I decided to make a simple spreadsheet, and finally it occured to me that it could be a nice idea posting the tables in this subreddit, so we can discuss about the subject.

Here we have a comparative table, including team record, games remaining, home-road games, number of back to backs, strenght of schedule, average wins of teams that they have to face from now on (as of this date), the number of teams that they'll have to play against with fewer wins than themselves (out of the number of games remaining excluding matchups between those 6 teams), and finally the odds of making the playoffs according to FiveThirtyEight.

This season has been incredibly fun to watch, from Terrence Davis playing so well, to Pascal Siakam taking another step forward. There is one thing that I’ve noticed from last year to this. The raptors team this year plays with grit, ball movement, solid team defence and great 3pt shooting. However there is a marked problem with the raptors against top teams. We just don’t have that player that can take over a game like Kawhi. When the shots just aren’t falling and you need someone to just create something we just do have it. This worries me immensely because in the playoffs as we all saw with the raptors against Philly, Kawhi had to go super sayian and we still barely won the series. The value of someone like that is incredible.

Harden should've won OPOY (Offensive Player of The Year) and Giannis MVP.  The MVP award is too fraught with factors of storyline narrative, team success, and straight up ambiguity.  No one knows exactly what makes up an MVP, and everyone has their own definition.  We've only had one unanimous winner ever so clearly it's defined differently by everyone. 

Enter in the OPOY and now we can separate the team success and narrative from the conversation.  Clearly Giannis was the best player last year with the most team success and a great story, that's great let him have the MVP.  But OPOY is about only the offensive side just like the DPOY.  It gives another award that can give hierarchy to all-time great players.  Looking back over the years it would be exciting to say Chris Paul has 4 1st team all NBA's and 3 OPOY's when he never won MVP.  It could also write many of the wrongs the MVP award has caused over the years such as:

2010-11 corrected MVP Lebron OPOY Rose

2016-17 corrected MVP Harden OPOY Westbrook

The Jazz would have to give up an additional asset, but I think it's clear now that Simmons and Embiid and Conley and Gobert do not work well together. 

Gobert hasn't worked well with Conley because Gobert runs straight to the rim and clogs up space for Conley who is very patient when he gets inside. Their timing and chemistry is not good. Conley played with Gasol who stays back and is more of a pick and pop player, or he'll catch the ball and make a move into the paint. There's not much of a lob threat to Gobert with Conley running the pick and roll.

Embiid and Simmons don't work well together because Simmons wants to push the ball and Embiid wants to slow down and work in the post. Embiid ends up getting double teamed too often and the sixers don't have the outside shooting to make teams pay when he gets doubled in the post. 

Imagine Gobert and Simmons running pick and roll together, both putting pressure on the rim. Almost every team would have to send another defender to help (maybe not the bucks with Giannis and Lopez). The Jazz have the best 3 pt shooting Percentage in the league because of shooters like Mitchell, Bogdonovic, Ingles, and O'Neal. 

Conley has historically been a pretty good spot up shooter, and has been pretty good for the Jazz since he came back from injury (specifically as a spot up shooter, not his overall performance). Embiid would have another shooter to kick the ball out to for a three with Conley. 

At face value, Conley for Simmons seems like a lopsided trade, but I honestly think it would make both teams better. Also, the sixers have limited salary cap flexibility over the next 5 years since the signed Harris and Simmons to long term extensions. Conley only has 2 years left on his contract, while Simmons has 5. There are other issues with whether or not Simmons would want to play with the Jazz and locker room fit (referring to the ROY beef between Mitchell and Simmons) but purely from a basketball perspective, this  seems like a trade that would make both teams better.

For those at work or the hard of hearing, I've transcribed subtitles on YouTube so sound isn't required.

Summary: 

\- Ben's diagnosis of ""lumbar nerve impingement"" typically means he has nerve irritation that's stemming from his lumbar (low back spine). In young athletes, this typically occurs due to either disc herniation which can push out and irritate the disc or a vertebral stress fracture in which severity will dictate why the nerve is irritated (potentially from swelling of the fracture or due to the disc slipping aka spondylolisthesis). In terms of treatment options, physio and epidural injections are the first line of treatment for herniation and if those fail, possibly surgery which is commonly a ""microdiscectomy"". For the vertebral stress fracture, first line is physio, second line is a TLSO brace,  and lastly is surgery, often a ""interarticular repair"". The timeline for physio is normally around 6 weeks, the brace is 12+ weeks, and surgery (both have good outcomes in young athletes) is about 3 months for a microdiscectomy and 4-6 months for an interarticular repair. Considering Simmons' is an elite athlete, these timelines will likely be condensed with the Philly medical staff re-evaluating in two weeks and then deciding if rehab is working or if another course is warranted. There's a lot of grey are with these lumbar cases so it's a wait and see approach.

As with most of my videos, I consulted with orthopedic surgeon fellow - u/fastigio1 \- and additionally for this video, I consulted with a spine specialist as well.

I choose top four, because I think there is a clear top four, but a legitimate argument on how you would order them.
The four guys consist of the original top 3, Simmons, Ingram, and Brown, with the addition of Siakam.

I personally don't think you can make a compelling argument for anyone else, but let me know if you would slot Sabonis, Murray, Brogdon or Hield in the top four.

The top of my 2016 big board:

1. B. Simmons- Even without a jump shot Simmons is still atop my big board. He is the most physically gifted player in the draft with the highest cieling. His size and speed combination is nearly unmatched in the NBA. Simmons is an excellent and versatile defender. He is a terror in transition and can get to rim at will in the half court as well. Simmons is a strong rebounder, has excellent vision and passing ability.

When Ebiid was out we saw how dominant Simmons could be. I believe if a team commited to buildaround Simmon's numerous gifts you could be a championship contender with him as your best player. 


2. P. Siakam- Probably the best of these four players at this moment. Siakam the best player on the 2nd seeded Raptors. Last year proved he could be a major contributor on a championship team. He is a two way force that takes very little off the table. Siakam is easy to build around, and can work with many different lineups and styles of play.  Does not need ball in his hands to be an impact player. 

It is worth noting Siakam is almost 26 and 2-3 years older than the other three. 


3. J. Brown- An excellent 3&amp;D player Brown has improved every season he has been in the league. He is a strong defender, able to defend both guards and forwards. He is an especially good on ball defender, relying on his quick feet and strong frame.

He has become a much better ball handler this year, unlocking another level to his offensive game. He can now attack the rim more effectively and get to where he wants on the floor. He has the strength and athleticism to finish both over and through defenders at the rim.

Brown is the type of complimentary star that can put a title contender over the top. I think he is the best leader of the four and can be an excellent 2nd or 3rd best player on a championship team.


4. B. Ingram- Has made a huge leap this year. Best scorer of this quartet. He is the best 3 pt shooter if the group, and gets to the line more than Siakam or Brown. Ingram is averaging almost 25 ppg on 60% TS. Ingram can score from anywhere on the court, and has the 2nd best play making ability after Simmons.

While his elite length gives him defensive upside, he is currently by far the worst defensive player of the four. All the advanced defensive metrics say he is a below average defender. If his improved shooting is real, he may pass Brown, but right now I prefer Browns all around game and leadership.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,79449,public,self,2016 NBA Draft,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/fayo5g/2016_nba_draft/,some_ads,7,,,099e778a-8b9a-11e8-b53d-0eebf66bed8a,Player Discussion,,,,,,,,,,,

However, he's still owed 41m and 44m for the next two seasons, which is a whooping amount for someone turning 35 soon. And he's surrounded by a cast of players that don't really need him to dominate for the first 40 minutes or so, which is imo the perfect situation for him. And his health is always a big question now, esp when it comes to playoffs.

So, if you are a GM for a contender this offseason, do you give up assests to acquire CP3 and upgrade your point guard to Clutch Point God? If so, how much do you give up?

Recently, Sam Esfandiara [posited a theory](https://twitter.com/samesfandiari/status/1231947582051454982):

""Theory: In the modern NBA, wings take longest to develop.""

This tweet resulted in much controversy and debate. In short, several, including Sam and Ethan Sherwood Strauss argued in favor of the wing being the position that takes longest to develop, but others such as Kevin Pelton and Mo Dakhil argued for the guard/point guard.

## The Argument for Wings

Sam later posted [this tweet](https://twitter.com/samesfandiari/status/1231948399869431813). In short, the argument for wings is that they ""have the most responsibility, to cover the most roles"". Sam stated that their roles are:

* Ability to guard multiple positions
* Ability to help
* Play on and off the ball
* ...

## The Argument for Guards

Pelton [later rebutted](https://twitter.com/kpelton/status/1232115274431651841). In short, point guards skills require more experience/skill.

## Data Aggregation

We can investigate this using the [basketball player grades provided by the BBall-Index](https://www.bball-index.com/2017-18-player-grades/). Having scraped all the data from 2014-15 to 2017-18 (all available seasons), we can dive into some meta-statistics to understand how certain positions improved at relevant skills over the 4 year span.

The BBall Index has a list of *skills* and the relevant grades (on a scale of 0.0-1.0). Here are all the skills:

* PERIMETER\_SHOT
* OFF\_BALL\_MOVEMENT
* ONE\_ON\_ONE
* FINISHING
* ROLL\_GRAVITY
* PLAYMAKING
* POST\_PLAY
* PERIMETER\_DEFENSE
* INTERIOR\_DEFENSE
* OREB
* DREB
* USAGE
* SELF\_CREATION

We can classify these skills into the following categories based on what skills **epitomize** each position:

## Wing Skills

* `PERIMETER_SHOT`
* `OFF_BALL_MOVEMENT`
* `ONE_ON_ONE`
* `FINISHING`
* `PERIMETER_DEFENSE`
* `SELF_CREATION`

## Guard Skills

* `PERIMETER_SHOT`
* `ONE_ON_ONE`
* `FINISHING`
* `PLAYMAKING`
* `SELF_CREATION`

Here's an idea of what the raw data looks like:

[For Wings](https://i.imgur.com/PfZytG0.png)

[For Guards](https://i.imgur.com/KnTS8fi.png)

# Analysis

First, let's filter so we only have young guards and wings. We'll perform this operation by finding all names of guards/wings with their `YRS_IN_LEAGUE` is 0.

## Plotting Average Y2Y Improvement of a Certain Skill

Here, we take an individual `stat` and find the average year to year improvement of an individual player. Then, we average the year to year improvement for each `stat` and plot the results.

[% Change in Key Wing Skills](https://i.imgur.com/SvdnjAC.png)

## Wing Takeaways

* Note the scale on this grid! Evidently, wings improve **MASSIVELY** continuously, but peter out by approximately year 3
* Interesting how much improvement their is in each skill. Off ball movement appears to be the most significant change upon arriving in the league and continues to be throughout the first couple years

[% Change in Key Guard Skills](https://i.imgur.com/mUuScmS.png)

## Guard Takeaways

* Note the scale on this graph - **NOT** as significant!
* Once again, guards also peter out by year 3
* Guards seem to improve most at finishing and one-on-one play

# Conclusions

According my plots above, the takeaway is fairly clear. Simply the scale on the plots seems to indicate that the majority of the improvement occurs between years 0-3. In this timespan, wings improve **greatly** at their most relevant skills, whereas guards do not.

As a result, I think it is reasonable to conclude that **GUARDS** are the more difficult to develop than wings.

&amp;#x200B;

**Explanation**: The first round in each series is pretty much guaranteed going to go somewhat like I predicted. Don't really see an upset happening. Now in the second round,  I got the Bucks in 6 because although the heat will for sure cause problems for the Bucks on defence, their offence looks very stalled at times and they will be overcome by Giannis' relentless drives and open threes generated as a result. Next, I got the Raptors in 7 because although both teams are constructed similarly; deep squads with a plethora of long, athletic wing players, the Raptors have legit veterans (Lowry, Ibaka, Gasol) that have been tested on some of the biggest stages while the Celtics are being lead by Kemba who has only been to the playoffs once and Tatum/Brown who are still relatively inexperienced. Moving out west, this was the tougher of the two conferences. People will bash me for saying Houston will beat the Lakers, but this Covington trade made the Lakers easier to beat but the Clippers harder. The Lakers simply do not have enough to stop Houston's small ball system, despite having ""Playoff Lebron"" on their squad. Between the Clippers and Nuggets, it would definitely be tough for the Clippers but again, due to their experience and depth, they would beat Denver in 6 games. Moving on to the ECF, the Bucks would edge out the Raptors in 7. Giannis is looking for his second MVP and a championship, with the East wide open, the ECF is his to lose. Out west, the Rockets would ultimately beat the Clippers in 7. Because this ""all-in"" small ball lineup is completely new, it gives D'Antoni numerous countermeasures on offence against certain defences. Give it a few months before defences start to slowly figure out how to defend the small ball lineup. The Clippers are the biggest threat to the Rockets, but when you have two of the most criticized and polarizing players on the same team, you'll bet they're looking for blood.

I argued there's a 0.3% chance of RJ Barrett ever being as good as prime Wade. I think that probability is too small to consider Wade to be RJ's ceiling. Logically, there has to be some nonzero percentage below which events are too unlikely to consider real possibilities: otherwise the ceiling for every player would be the GOAT, and the best-case scenario for a team each season is 98–0. So where's the line below which we don't entertain probabilities? 1 in 100? 1 in 1000? 1 in 10,000?

&amp;#x200B;

Note: This analysis was part of a long \[blog post\]([https://vishaalagartha.github.io/projects/2020/02/25/playtype](https://vishaalagartha.github.io/projects/2020/02/25/playtype)) I wrote. If you're interested in how I performed the analysis in detail, please refer to the post.

&amp;#x200B;

\## Introduction

&amp;#x200B;

We can premise this analysis with the \[famous statement from Charles Barkley\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpcZNhJfqhQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpcZNhJfqhQ)) about \*Jump Shooting Teams\*. In short, he said that the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors would not succeed in the playoffs due to their reliance on jump shooting. He argued, as analysts and old-timers often do, that the offense \*""bogs down""\* in the playoffs and teams that will succeed in the playoffs have the ability to run an offense that slows down.

&amp;#x200B;

Even after the 3-point revolution and the Warriors winning multiple titles, analysts are still skeptic of certain offenses. For example in the recent \[Real GM Radio Podcast with Danny Leroux and Jared Dubin\]([https://www.podcastone.com/episode/Jared-Dubin-on-the-Deadline-and-Title-Contenders](https://www.podcastone.com/episode/Jared-Dubin-on-the-Deadline-and-Title-Contenders)), they say they're skeptical of Milwaukee's ability to perform in the playoffs, saying their superstar-centered offense reliant on Giannis passing out of double teams to 3-point shooters does not work in the playoffs.

&amp;#x200B;

I try to debunk this myth by comparing regular season play types vs. playoff play types for each team in the 2017-18 and 2018-19 years.

&amp;#x200B;

\## Data Aggregation

&amp;#x200B;

Data was aggregated from \[[stats.nba.com](https://stats.nba.com)\]([https://stats.nba.com/](https://stats.nba.com/)). They have a separate \[endpoint\]([https://stats.nba.com/teams/isolation/](https://stats.nba.com/teams/isolation/)) for play types, tracked by Synergy since the year 2015-16.

&amp;#x200B;

\[Here is a snippet of the data as a table.\]([https://i.imgur.com/Jvjt5of.png](https://i.imgur.com/Jvjt5of.png))

\## Difference in Playoff and Regular Season Possession Percentages

&amp;#x200B;

\[Team by team analysis of play types bar chart\]([https://i.imgur.com/HVv9OYn.png](https://i.imgur.com/HVv9OYn.png))

&amp;#x200B;

\## General Observations on Each Play Type

&amp;#x200B;

\* Transition - Seems to decrease for most teams except Milwaukee

\* Isolation - Kind of all over the place except for Portland - probably due to Damian Lillard in Dame Time.

\* Pick and Roll Ball Handler - Seems to increase, overall. This pattern makes sense with the \*isolation increases\* premise since there is less passing.

\* Pick and Roll Roll Man - As as result of the above pattern, this does and should decrease.

\* Postup - Seems to decrease \*\*significantly\*\*. This pattern would go against the classic premise of ""oh, we have to dump the ball to the big man"". Note that this even happens for teams with skilled big men (e.g. the 76'ers with Joel Embiid).

\* Spotup - Spotup increases as a general pattern.

\* Handoff and Cuts - Both of these seem to decrease. This pattern agrees with the premise that teams run \*less\* plays in the playoffs and allow the game to flow.

\* Offscreen - Seems to generally decrease, not signficantly.

\* Offensive Rebound - No significant pattern.

&amp;#x200B;

\## Team Differences in Overall Offense

&amp;#x200B;

Which teams change their offenses the most?

&amp;#x200B;

\## General Observations:

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, it seems like the more successful teams remain in the middle. Look at the Bucks, Warriors, Raptors, and Philadelphia.

Compare this to the teams that change the \*\*most\*\* (Nets, Pistons, Magic). These teams dropped out of the playoffs \*\*very\*\* quickly (1st round).

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, compare this to teams that did not change very much. We look at the Rockets and the Spurs and label them as \*dogmatic\* often. Houston is unwilling to change their 3-point heavy offense centered around Harden. Similarly, the Spurs remain in the midrange and have a hard time adjusting their play.

&amp;#x200B;

As a result, we can, at a glance, say that teams \*\*must\*\* be flexible in their play types. They should be able to adjust a fair amount, but not too much from their regular season play.

&amp;#x200B;

\## Which play types are bound to drop off from the season in the playoffs?

&amp;#x200B;

Now, we analyze using the play type as the \*independent\* variable.

&amp;#x200B;

\[Here is a snippet of the data.\]([https://i.imgur.com/OgjkOsC.png](https://i.imgur.com/OgjkOsC.png))

&amp;#x200B;

\## Box Plot of Regular Season vs. Playoff Play Types

&amp;#x200B;

\[Play Type Possession % Box Plot\]([https://i.imgur.com/eM2Ticu.png](https://i.imgur.com/eM2Ticu.png))

&amp;#x200B;

Here, we can clearly see the distributions. Some general takeaways:

&amp;#x200B;

\* The most popular play types remain primarly the same (Spotup, PRBallHandler, and Transition)

\* Distributions during the playoffs are much larger (i.e. the orange boxes are generally taller than the blue ones). This indicates that teams are much more varied in their offensive play types in the playoffs.

&amp;#x200B;

\## Bar Plot of Regular Season vs. Playoff Play Types

&amp;#x200B;

\[Play Type Possession % Bar Plot\]([https://i.imgur.com/GPeV5bS.png](https://i.imgur.com/GPeV5bS.png))

&amp;#x200B;

Here, we can clearly identify differences using the \[95% Confidence Interval\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence\_interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval)) illustrated using the vertical lines on the above plot.

&amp;#x200B;

We see that the difference in Regular Season and Playoff Play Type distributions is not statistically significant \*\*except\*\*:

&amp;#x200B;

\## Post Ups

&amp;#x200B;

Post Ups decrease greatly in the playoffs. This goes against the premise that 'teams need to be able to dump the ball to the big man in the post in the playoffs'.

&amp;#x200B;

\## Spotup

&amp;#x200B;

Spot Ups increase greatly in the playoffs. These are plays where players \*do not\* come off a screen, but end up catching the ball coming off of a screen and either shooting immediately, dribbling into a pull up, dribbling into a floater, or dribbling and taking a shot at the rim.

&amp;#x200B;

\# Overall Conclusions

&amp;#x200B;

\* Successful teams do not change their offenses too much (compared to BKN, DET, ORL)

\* Successful teams should also not be too dogmatic (compared to HOU, SAS)

\* Post Ups decrease in the playoffs. Teams do not need a big man to dump it down to in the playoffs.

\* Spotups increase in the playoffs. Teams should be able to pass to individuals and have them run the offense individually.

\* Contrary to popular belief, isolation does not increase in the playoffs.

&amp;#x200B;

\# Appendix

&amp;#x200B;

For those interested, \[here are the same plots for seasons since all Synergy Data has been released\]([https://imgur.com/a/RvghPnQ](https://imgur.com/a/RvghPnQ))

&amp;#x200B;

The most striking difference in these plots is the prevalence of isolation plays. Maybe last year was just an anomaly?

Excerpts:

&gt; Why was BPM changed?

The simplest answer: Russell Westbrook. Westbrook's 2016-17 MVP season graded out at 15.6 in the original BPM. Essentially, his 10.7 RPG and 10.4 APG broke the interaction terms between those statistics. So Westbrook's great season ended up being 20% better than any other season in the database, which just didn't pass the smell test. Along similar lines, assists without rebounds and rebounds without assists were penalized in the original BPM (hurting the likes of John Stockton, Steve Nash, Hassan Whiteside and Patrick Ewing).

The article goes on to list various impacts to rankings in OBPM, DBPM, and VORP.  John Stockton's ranking jumped a lot on the list, now 3rd in VORP all-time and 8th in BPM.

Regarding Stockton, this is the explanation for his jump: ""He's aided by the changes in the way the assist and rebound terms interact. Further, the old system said ""no rebounds = bad defender."" BPM 2.0 says ""elite steals, good defensive teams = good defender.""""",False,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,79335,public,self,Basketball-Reference reworked BPM,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/f9svdd/basketballreference_reworked_bpm/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both are fast, physical players who use size to score in the paint. Obviously Giannis the better player, as he is the reigning league MVP, but stats and my eyes say that Ben Simmons is far superior as a playmaker. Simmons averages 8 assists per game for his career (8.5 per 36mins/ 11 per 100 possessions) and assists on 35% of his teammates shots when he is on the floor, per basketball reference. Giannis averages a little over 4 assists for his career (4 per 36 mins/6 per 100 possessions).Giannis' averages suffer from his bad early seasons, but he still has not averaged over 6 any season. His assist percentage is also up over the last season and half (30% last season and currently 34%), but Simmons has had a higher AST% all three seasons he has played. The major difference in these two players is scoring. Since hiring Bud in the summer of 2018, Giannis has upped his scoring from 23ppg to 30ppg this season. Even before that summer, Giannis was scoring more than Simmons. Simmons seems to be a more deferential player, preferring to make a play over scoring himself, but with the better spacing that the Bucks provide, I personally think he could be a 20ppg guy any night. The question is this: could the Bucks, who built a near perfect team around Giannis, have done the same with Simmons, and would they still be as dominant as they are today?

Every team is gonna have their bad nights on defense and every year there’s gonna be some bad defensive teams but just look how offense is today and how many screens players use and how many players are able to shoot. That’s a whole lot to pay attention and teams have to be extremely vocal/ switching / and helping on defense to really be able to guard the team well and that’s not possible all night every night. 

An example i use is the Celtics lakers game from like a day or two ago, look how Daniel Theis screens for Tatum and then goes in and screens the big while Tatum drives in and basically has a free look at the layup because the big can’t contest the shot. 

Or the lakers vs Portland game after Kobe passed when dame dropped 50, watch how he uses the screen and the defender trying to chase him off can’t get around because dame pulls up immediately to either draw the foul or just make the shot which you have to have the big step up but then a lot of switching and talking has to happen to contain that.

Or how Trae Young and Lillard can make that half court 3 so easily and consistently and now one guy is basically guarding up so high and the pnr capability is crazy when you think about it.

I took every major stat and plotted its average per game from 00/01 season to 19/20. All the graphs are [here](https://imgur.com/a/MCtTe5C). 

The only big thing I could make out is that NBA became 3pt league - since 00/01 season the number of both attempted and made three pointers more than doubled. It was also obvious that there were more  offensive possesions because assist, defensive rebound and attempted and made fields goals numbers increased, I believe it's all because the game got faster with 7 second offense and all that. Apart from those, NBA has not changed that much, at least stat-wise, which was really surprising for me. I'm very interested to hear your thoughts on those stats.

The majority of it wasn't too revealing given the fact that I've watched pretty much every game of the season and have talked about the scheme in the past and how successful they've been at walling off attempts near the rim and concede threes in an era where the three is more dangerous than ever. 

I wanted to contrast that with recent tweets from John Schuhmann on Twitter and other information about [how teams fare against the upper echelon of offensive teams in the league](https://twitter.com/johnschuhmann/status/1229522810571231233), most notably the top 13. The Bucks aren't otherworldly here (nor are they offensively against the top 13 defenses), and what's arguably as telling is how many more games they have left against premier talent before the start of the playoffs.

Jaylen Brown plus Theis plus Gordon Hayward plus Marcus Smart for Simmons and Al Horford.  

Maybe if you include Horford or Harris and get a really interesting package back.  Something like Simmons and Tobias Harris for the Atlanta package next year.  

Or maybe to the raptors for Kyle Lowry and Siakim.  

I really can't think of any moves that make sense for both teams even that Toronto team I feel like that deal doesn't get made for some reason from both sides.  

Simmons plus Horford for Ball Jrue Redick J Hayes and like 3 first round picks still doesn't feel like enough.",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,79183,public,self,"What would make you trade embiid or simmons?

Obviously, the 3pt revolution is the current hotness, but this won't last forever. Eventually, shooters will become too highly valued to be stock-pile-able and defenses will figure out a tactic to counter it. Also, if small-ball continues to down-size centers and power forwards, there'll be vulnerabilities inside. It might seem like this current style will last forever, but it probably felt the same way in the 90s and early 2000s when the torch passed from MJ to Kobe and Shaq and Duncan were in their prime.

I also stumbled upon this article (https://www.insidehook.com/article/sports/the-future-of-the-nfl-is-in-baltimore-and-san-francisco), which is about how NBA teams can learn from how the Ravens and 49ers rushing games combined modern and old-school tactics and decimated defenses. I'll excerpt it here: 

""Just as the Ravens and 49ers took over the NFL by adapting smashmouth football to the spread-offense era, these plus-sized playmakers are poised to update post play....Doncic is already the league’s fifth most efficient post-up player, generating 1.18 points per possession from the post. Siakam’s herky-jerky post game has helped transform him into Toronto’s post-Kawhi Leonard star; Ben Simmons has a 5:1 assist-to-turnover ratio when dishing from the post. To wit, stockier guards are also finding success in the post, with all-stars like Jimmy Butler and rookies like R.J. Barrett thriving in equal measure.

Certainly, Joel Embiid and LeMarcus Aldridge — and DeAndre Ayton, if we’re being super generous — proudly continue the lineage of post-centric stars, but the future of post play has evolved. No longer are post-ups Godzilla vs. Mothra showdowns where two large men assert their manliness one baby hook at a time. Instead, post-ups in 2020 reveal the fault lines of defenses that are forced to choose whether to prevent threes and leave one overmatched defender marooned against LeBron James or provide help at the rim and risk giving up open threes. ...

Today, three-point shooting is basketball’s most widely valued skill, but the next big market inefficiency will be finding players who can fully capitalize on the space all this shooting affords. The traditional big man may be gone, but the post-up will eternally recur.""",True,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,79161,public,self,"The Post-Up Isn't Dead, It's Just Taking a Nap",0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/f8kk6n/the_postup_isnt_dead_its_just_taking_a_nap/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the significant areas it lags behind the NFL and MLB (and maybe NHL but I don't follow that enough to really know) is rivalries. The NFL has iconic, generations spanning rivalries such as Packers vs Bears, Broncos vs Chiefs, The entire NFC East as well as newer rivalires such as 49ers vs Seahawks and Saints vs Falcons. The MLB has massive rivalries such as Red Sox vs Yankees, Giants vs Dodgers, Cubs vs Cardinals as well as newer rivalries in Astros vs Rangers and Phillies vs Nationals. Fans of those leagues care when those teams match up in the regular season or the postseason. 

The NBA really only has one long standing rivalry and that is Celtics vs Lakers. However, this rivalry pales in comparison to NFL and MLB rivalries.

&gt;Why do you think this is

Most people say because the NBA is younger than the other leagues which is true. However, I don't think that matters. The NBA has been a major institution in American sports for 60 years by this point. Basically every American has grown up with the NBA being a major sport. Most Americans grew up with parents who grew up with the NBA being a major sport. The age of the sport isn't why the rivalries are so weak.

I have three reasons. One, the regular season is weak. It isn't like in the MLB where only 4 teams per league get in (though that number might increase) and it isn't like the NFL where there are only a few games so you don't play every team in the league. In the NFL, you play each division opponent twice while the rest of the league you don't even play every year. 

Two is that divisions don't matter. In the NFL, winning your division means (at the minimum) you host a playoff game not to mention you get into the playoffs. In the MLB, winning your division means you don't have to play the wild card game which is incredibly valuable. In the NBA winning your divisions means ... nothing. 

Third, player movement. In the NFL, Aaron Rodger's mastery has lead to the Packers strengthening their rivalry with the rest of the division. In the MLB, Kershaw has been dominant against the Giants. In the NBA, Pacers and Heat were developing a rivalry but then LeBron and Paul George left so that ended. Raptors vs Sixers/Bucks would have been great rivalries but then Kawhi left. OKC vs Golden State would have been an amazing Big Market vs Small Market rivalry but then Durant jumped ship. Player movement has destroyed the chance of rivalries. 

&gt;Does this bother you?

Yes. I feel like rivalries make fans more passionate which improves the relevance of the sport. Rivalries will be needed if the NBA ever wants to pass up the NFL in America.

&gt;How to rectify this

Few things. Make winning your division matter. I'd go back to where winning your division guarantees home court advantage in the first round. You also need to stop player movement/curb player empowerment. Player rivalries don't have the same cache as team vs team rivalries. The NBA needs to realize this and adjust accordingly",False,False,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,79129,public,self,"Rivalries in the NBA are way weaker than rivalries in the other major sports.

He mostly shared the PG role with DJ Augustin, who was injured on 14th of January and missed the last month of action. During that period, Fultz saw even bigger increase in his role  and had 6.4 assists on average.

I made a [Shot Chart for Fultz](https://i.imgur.com/t0PLT80.png), and it can be seen that his shot is still problematic, but it is certainly improving. You all remember his shot with a ""hitch"" which is why he received various criticisms before the draft and during the first/second season. [This is what I'm talking about](https://streamable.com/gjj42). Even a person who has never played basketball can see that something is wrong here. Behind this is the story that the Sixers misdiagnosed his injury and gave him the wrong therapy, and as a result, the correction of his shot took too long. The story is quite complicated and can be comfortably told in a separate post.

Fast Forward to this season, and his shot [looks like this](https://streamable.com/h32of) (the recording was made during preseason). This is already much better. All in one fluid motion without hitches and ugly pauses. And even if you only look at the data you will see that his shot is improving. Free throw percentages through the seasons:

Season 1: 47.6 FT%
Season 2: 56.8 FT%
Season 3: 75.0 FT%

75% is already a solid percentage for a point guard, far from an above average percentage, but the FT% in first through seasons were terrible even for centers. The mid-range jumper now looks respectable for Fultz, but the three pointer still remains a problem because sometimes he has that hitch I talked about before. But all this is a very good sign and indicates that Fultz is doing a lot to improve the shot.

What Fultz is really good at now is driving and finishing at the rim, and some shots from the paint (generally from a distance shorter than free throw range). He ""wiggles"" around the mid-range in order to find the optimal shot or pass (many assists come from such ""cuts"" by teammates), and with this action he reminds me of Chris Paul and even Kawhi (they are not the same position, but Kawhi is one of the best at mid-range). I made a chart showing all the guards and their [efficiency in the ""Restricted Area""](https://i.imgur.com/hIlu7BU.png). In my opinion this is very encouraging for Fultz because he is more efficient than Westbrook, Lillard and Lavine (etc.) who are already renowned scorers.

Markelle is only the fourth option this season in Magic, behind Vucevic, Fournier and Gordon, and maybe even Isaac while he's healthy. I think this situation will change, especially if Fultz continues to work on his shot, as other segments are already covered pretty well. If all that happens, and I honestly think he will, Fultz could be a top contender for the MIP award next season, and then maybe some other awards...

Magic finally look to me as a team that has figured out things, as a team that has a future and invests in it. Fultz, Isaac, Bamba, Gordon, Iwundu are all good building blocks for the future with veteran reinforcements like Vucevic and Fournier holding the wheel in their hands for some time. They are also flirting with the playoffs this season, it would be really interesting to see Fultz play in his first playoff appearances.

And let's not forget, Fultz is 21 years old. For him, this was a Rookie season on a team that believes in and supports him.
